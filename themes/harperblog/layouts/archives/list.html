<h1 id="writing">My old blog: Nata2.org</h1>

<p>From 2000 to 20015 I blogged regularly at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/nata2.org" target="_blank">nata2.org</a>. I wrote around 1416 and covered anything from technology to my dating life. It was a lot of fun and was a great outlet. Around the launch of Twitter (~2006/2007), I stopped doing updating the site regularly.</p>

<p>Here is an archive of all of those posts.</p>

<div class="post">
  <ul>
  {{ range .Data.Pages }}
    <li>{{ .Date.Format "Jan 2, 2006" }} &mdash; <a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a></li>
  {{ end }}
  </ul>

</div>
