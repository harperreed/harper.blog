    <p>So on thursday I got really bored and made a false profile for a <a href="http://bigchurch.com">christian dating service</a>. It is really lame.. however we made a funny profile. unfortunantly it deleted the best part. I was so sad. :( here is an excerpt: <blockquote><small>
When I was a younger lad, I unfortunately witnessed a crime of passion that changed my life forever. Finding my mother in bed with our gardener caused me to reject the life of sin that had been a part of my life up until that point. I read a bunch of theological texts and realized that I was not too late to change my ways. In my 15th year I started going back to church. Since then I have attempted to contribute and participate in my Christian community every chance I get.
</small></blockquote>
So anyway. I haven&rsquo;t been to work since thrusday.. which in turn meant that I haven&rsquo;t been on the computer since then. My parents came and visited. it was a lot of fun. we ate a lot. and walked a bunch. we went to a number <a href="http://www.bin36.com/">of</a> <a href="http://www.veggiediner.com/">rather</a> <a href="http://www.masrestaurant.com/">good</a> <a href="http://www.smithandwollensky.com/">resturants</a>. I like it when they visit.. I really enjoy my family. we don&rsquo;t put a lot of stock into the <a href="http://www.tastesofchicago.com/">generic part of family vacations</a>.. the tourist part. so we just hang out and chill.  <br/><br/>boy oh boy.. <a href="http://www.babyink.com/">this is crazy</a>. <br/>i thought the movie <a href="http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/28dayslater/">28 days later</a> was good. the minimalism reminded me a lot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305228876/nata2productions">funny games</a>(which you should all see), it was painful to wait for things to happen. I loved how choppy the action was. I thought it really showed the rage that the &ldquo;<a href="http://la.cacophony.org/zombies-gore4.jpg">zombies</a>&rdquo; <a href="http://bushong.net/pics/photos/pets/kirby/possessed-kitty.jpg">possessed</a>.</p>
