    <p>So dyaln flew into town on friday morning. We hung out at my work for a bit and then we went to lunch. Dylan then went to my apartment and hung out with matiss and took a nap. I cam e home and it was off to the juggling fest. Whee. as you might or might not know, stevenson juggling festival was this weekend. It is a juggle fest at a northern suburban high school it is a huge highschool.. veyr large.. so anyway.. we went to the juggling fest and juggled a bunch it ruled quite a bit. We met up with my friend mark and hung out.. dylan learned a bunch of new unicycle stuff and generally was a cool brother.. while matiss was a bad bad bad brother.. like always&hellip; so anyway..<br/>Saturday we went back to the fest and juggled all day. dylan hung out with our friend mark and brian while matiss and myself went to beck&rsquo;s birthday party(fun fun) and then we came back just in time to watch the Toss Up show(it was ok). Some of the guys were insane. <a href="http://www.patrickmcguire.net/">Seriously insane</a>. So we went to a really poor putt putt golf place and played a very quick game of putt putt and then went home and slept. <br/>Today.. we went to the fest and dylan ruled the unicycle mounts.. I should really learn that stuff.. I have this dream of going to work on a unicycle. it might rule. I don&rsquo;t know yet ;)<br/><br/>so pictures and movies will come soon. I gotta put the videos together.. ;) hehe. <br/><br/>well I am damned tired. so sleepy.. juggling so much will make you very very tired.. ;)</p>
