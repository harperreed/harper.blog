    <p>so .. the last 2 weeks I haven&rsquo;t really hung out or gone out as much as I had before. it is weird when you go out an insane amount and then suddenly stop. I like it.. the stopping.. it was so relaxing and so nice. I hung out with my mom and aunt/cousin.. and hung out with marcia a bunch.. and now I am needing to re-introduce myself into the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world. I really love going out.. but it requires so much maintenence. you have to keep up with so much. I think I am going to edit what I do. because I need to balance my worlds a bit more. now that I have three worlds.. I have my going out world&hellip; my work world.. my good friend world.. and my ner world&hellip; wait that is four worlds.. I was doing well with two or three.. but four.. wow.. too much.. heh. I imagine I will work it out. <br/><bR>hanging out with marcia rules. hehe. totally. I am smitten. hopefully things work out reasonably well in that situation. it is always tough hanging out with new people.. you can&rsquo;t always predict how things will work or what the dynamics are in certain situations. I will probably soon know. girls with short short hair are cute. <br/><br/>Bec is leaving on monday. it is a real bummer. I am sure matiss is bummed. it sucks when people leave.. stupid people. hopefully we will hang out this weekend and have a really good time. <br/><br/>in other news.. my stress has led me to make drastic decisions in regards to my appearance. I now look like a frog. no really. I set up an appointment to finish up <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures/harper/tattoo">my tattoo</a>.. which is super exciting. I am going to <a href="http://tomatotattoo.com">tomato tattoo</a> on thrusday. hopefully it rules. I am ALWAYS scared of tattoos.. cuz they really hurt. I will bring a camera. I want to get good pictures. I love pictures. then.. a week from thursday - I am going to the hair place to dye my hair again. this time a bit more drastic. I love it. I have had a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fharper%2Fme&amp;img=haircut%20023.jpg">mohawk for so long now</a>. <br/><br/>soon I will be a real boy. with a little hope and a lot of love.. I will get my yoyo&rsquo;s today. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fharper%2Fme&amp;img=Chicago%20016.jpg">i NEED them</a>. NEEEEED!</p>
