    <p>Last night a friend of mine gave me a couple tickets to the interpol show at the metro. it was a good time. I hadn&rsquo;t really heard them and they did put on a good show. it was nice to see and I was able to see soem friends and all that.. wee.. I should get my ipod today. I am excited. I am redoing my MP3 attitude.. I am gunna be setting up a centralized MP3 system for our apartment. I am kinda excited about the prospects.. heh. whatever. <br/><br/>on friday we all hung out and watched movies.. ate pizza and just chilled. it was funny - because I forget how much of a nerd I am - and my friend brock brought a friend over and I don&rsquo;t think she was into the &ldquo;weird&rdquo; movies that matiss and I were representin&rsquo; - I laughed. I wonder what happens when people start hanging out with us. do they think we are insane. cuz are collection of entertainment is very &ldquo;interesting..&rdquo; in light of that.. my illuminati game should be arriving soon ;)<br/><br/>i am reading a book by Neil Gaimen called America Gods. I don&rsquo;t like it as much as I liked neverwhere, which is making me sad. hopefully good omens will be better. I enjoy my new style of reading: cluster reading. it is where I read a bunch of books by the same author all in a row. it is quite interesting. <br/><bri currently HATE my cd player in my computer. it keeps skipping<br/>Did you know that <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/novak/cst-edt-novak13.html">republican senators think that the white house is arrogant</a>? or that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43909-2003Jan11">bush has planned to attack IRAQ since sept. 17 <b>2001</b></a>? probably not. but I bet you had noticed that the RIAA was <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/28817.html">hacked</a> again. ohh the irony. Here is a nifty <a href="http://www.beautyreborn.com/pages/beforeandafter.htm">link</a> - which garned the following quote from my friend john: &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve never seen that many tits presented in such a&hellip;unerotic way.</i>&rdquo; Oh and I almost forgot the most important link. <a href="http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/">here</a> is an annotated bible targeted towards skeptics. wheee..</p>
