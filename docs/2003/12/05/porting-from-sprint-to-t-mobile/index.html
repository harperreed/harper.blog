  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>On the LNP day last month i immediately ported from sprint to t-mobile. I had been with sprint for 4 years and was appreciative of their &ldquo;3g&rdquo; technology. but after gettgin completely screwed one too many times i decided to switch. I had a tough time figuring out which provider to go with, although i had narrowed the phone down to the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/t610/">t610</a>.</p>

<p>I really liked the look and shape of the t610. the technology was right, the price was right and it was supported by a bunch of providers. so i called around and originally planned on going with cingular. it is supported by my work and would be convienient to get a number from work for use in a phone. however - i was annoyed by paying a bundle for data and was attracted to t-mobiles unlimited data plan for 19.95/month. so i went with t-mobile.  in retrospect it seems to be a <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/steve/archives/000267.html">good decision</a>.</p>

<p>so i called t-mobile and initiated the port. this was <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>24</sub> so they were quite busy and didn&rsquo;t have the computers up to take the port info. so they wrote it down on paper. i waited the 24hrs. when i came into work the next day my phone had arrived and i was on my way. but i wasn&rsquo;t yet ported. my sprint phone still worked. so i called tmobile again and i talked to a porting women who told me that no body had submitted my port to the &ldquo;port authority&rdquo; and that it wasn&rsquo;t real yet. so she took all the info and initiated the port. by 5 oclock that day i was able to call on the tmobile network - but i wasn&rsquo;t able to recieve calls on the tmobile net. by 8 i was able to do both.</p>

<p>So far i have enjoyed tmobile. sprint has a much better website and the cdma2k or whatever is a lot faster than the gprs. but bluetooth owns. i really appreciate the fact that most GSM providers are standards based.</p>

<p>now i am ready for the fun.</p>
