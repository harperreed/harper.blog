  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>I use twitter quite a bit. I like to post to twitter in the most unobtrusive way possible. I don&rsquo;t like to interupt my workflow to post a quick thought or update. When they used to have their Jabber bot running - it was easy for me to just type in my update and get on with my gmail session or work. I didn&rsquo;t have to load a page that was often down, or use some other tool. I was bummed when the jabber bot went away. I needed it back to keep up with my use case.</p>

<p>I got tired of waiting, so i made <a href="http://excla.im">Excla.im</a>. It is a simple <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">App Engine</a> hosted application that allows a person to very simply update their twitter status from any jabber account. It is not very feature full, doesn&rsquo;t update all the other sites and doesn&rsquo;t do much else besides just interact with the twitter API. It is very simple.</p>

<p>The technology behind it is just as simple. The GAE app is written in python and uses the <a href="http://google-app-engine-django.googlecode.com/">django helper</a>. It is super simple and is basically a storage container for account info. It was a breeze to develop and fun to work with.</p>

<p>The Jabber bot was a bit more complicated. I ended up using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sleekxmpp/">sleekxmpp library</a> to do all the XMPP heavy lifting. It is an awesome library. Makes all the hard stuff easy. I then used <a href="http://hathawaymix.org/">Shane Hathaway&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://hathawaymix.org/Software/Sketches/daemon.py">daemon.py</a> to help daemonize the bot (btw thanks to <a href="http://anders.conbere.org/">Anders</a> for talking me through the dirtiness of daemonizing). To hook into twitter I used the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/">python twitter</a> library. It is featureful and super easy to use. It also supports in newer versions (post <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/source/browse/trunk/twitter.py?r=112">r112</a>) setting the source.</p>

<p>I was then able to wrap this all up in a fancy little bot that on receiving a message, grabs encrypted credentials from the GAE app, sends the message to twitter&rsquo;s api and then chills out. Pretty sweet. Currently all the heavy lifting is on the bot side, instead of on the webapp side - but i may change that.</p>

<p>At some point, I would like to be able to grab a users twitter friends updates and push them to their jabber ids. However - I have yet to figure out a nice and clean way to get the updates without having them seem batched. I have some ideas and a couple things fleshed out - but i don&rsquo;t want to totally replicate twitter just to get my friends updates.</p>

<p>I am toying with putting the bot up on google code since it is pretty simple and could easily be hooked into almost any webapp. I think that the idea of a simple (simpler than sleekbot) webapp integrated jabber bot would have been helpful in writing this - and i imagine that people looking to do a similar thing may have use for my hacked together code.</p>

<p>A couple take aways from doing this project. First off - python is fun. Second - working with a designer makes things look a LOT better. <a href="http://www.aaronsalmon.com/">Aaron Salmon</a> took some time to make excla.im look MUCH better than it did. Check out his stuff and hire him.</p>
