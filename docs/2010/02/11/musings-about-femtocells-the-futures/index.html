    <p><blockquote>I wrote most of this entry the day before the earthquake in Haiti.

<strong>The femtocell</strong></p>

<p>At the recent CES, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagicJack">magicJack company</a> announced that they wanted to release a consumer grade FemtoCell device as an upgrade to their USB FXO/Softphone device.  Note: magicJack is an insane company. You probably have seen them on television commercials while watching USA &lsquo;Up All Night&rsquo;.  While these commercials almost seem scam-like, they have apparently sold 5 million USB magicJacks.  That&rsquo;s a lot of phone calls!</p>

<p>A femtocell device is basically a mini GSM/CDMA tower. Think of it as a wi-fi AP but instead of wi-fi - it is GSM. You could drop it into your house, plug it into the Internet, and suddenly get 5 bars of connectivity on your mobile handset - instead of the standard AT&amp;T 1 bar. magicJack is offering the same service the USB dongle provides (unlimited calling and what not), but for mobile phones.  As a consumer, you would need to configure your handset to use the magicJack femtocell to receive/send calls.  When you are in range of the device (w/ signal strength enough to cover ~3000 sq. ft. house), you would bypass your carrier and use the magicJack for all incoming and outgoing calls. AWESOME.  Especially with the likes of Google Voice.</p>

<p>There are questions on the legality of such a device - but it is apparently legal to use inside your residence.</p>

<p>Side note: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=magicjack+sip">Magicjack is SIP</a>. And <a href="http://magicjackhacks.com/">hackable</a>. There is a cat and mouse game being played out trying to unlock it.  You can even use it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk_(PBX)">Asterisk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The thoughts</strong></p>

<p>So I began to think.  Femtocells could be used to open up mobile VOIP.  One scenario is that you could jump on a 3rd party carrier for a limited time to make a p2p VOIP call using your current GSM/WCDMA mobile device.  That is really awesome.  More importantly, what&rsquo;s REALLY awesome is the pirate (3rd party) carriers.</p>

<p>Imagine purchasing 100 <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2010/01/17/i-love-phones-designed-for-developing-countries/">Motorola F3</a>&rsquo;s, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnu_radio">GNU Radio USRP2</a> (~$1400) running the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBTS">OpenBTS stack</a> and a super huge antenna - and suddenly becoming a rural/developing country mobile provider. Or - if you&rsquo;re more interested in being a pirate carrier - you could run this setup in a city and be a carrier for the dark side (drugs, gangs, nerds&hellip;). This inexpensive setup is available (and achievable) today!  In case of the apocalypse/disaster/camping/nerdcamp - I think it would be nice to have a set up to deploy to organize/help people.</p>

<p>My mind started to work into overtime.  I began thinking about the ramifications of hacking the magicJack. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be neat to use femtocell technology to distribute ad hoc mobile carriers around a neighborhood/disaster area/rural/developing country?  You could hook the magicJack femtocell up to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FON#Fonera_2.0n">Fon2 device (usb/linux/broadband)</a> and distribute them around in places with connectivity. All you would need is a better antenna and some software to manage the provisioning and device identification. BAM! Instant pirate P2P GSM carrier.</p>

<p>I am hoping that this type of convergence will lead us <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/">to the future</a>.</p>
