      <description>So i have been ordering from hivizone, a hong kong asian cinema store, for about 4 years now. and they send via speedpost - which eventually turns into USPS. well. goddamn USPS always makes receiving packages a nightmare. so for the second time in the last six months i have placed an order with hivizone and USPS leaves an attempt of delivery notice. So i fill it out appropriately and leave it.</description>
