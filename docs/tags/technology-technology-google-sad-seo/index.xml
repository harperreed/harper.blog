      <description>Usually when I blog about Google, I am happy. but today it is a sad sad Google day. For the first time since the days of metacrawler, a search for Harper Reed doesn&amp;rsquo;t return one of my sites as the first hit. This really hurts. I guess I have been slacker at my SEO. Gotta jump back up there. I hope that harperreed.com drops once Google reindexes and notices that their title isn&amp;rsquo;t harper/reed anymore.</description>
