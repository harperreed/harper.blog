      <description>I for some reason had an aversion to updating my website this week. I think it was cuz I was so busy at work. serious. I was crazy busy. and it was frustrating things I was doing. for some reason - everything I tried to do didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I was annoyed. and most of the stuff was just stupid. heh. like I had done it one hundred times before and none of it worked this time.</description>
