      <description>This pass weekend was the skinnyCorp Christmas party and what not. It was awesome. An entire weekend of entertainment, debauchery and insanity. Pure insanity. Fun Fun. The insanity started at work around 4. The entire day had been insane, with a supposed real world appearance and our Internet going down, so when 4pm rolled around and everyone gathered around for secret Santa - everyone was pretty hyped up. I love secret Santa gift giving.</description>
