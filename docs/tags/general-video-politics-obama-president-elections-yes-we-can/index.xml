      <description>This weekend I went and volunteered for the Obama Campaign. It was a great experience. I showed up at 12pm and stayed until around 5. I was surrounded by great people who all believed in Obama and his movement. Quite inspiring. I worked on validating submitted volunteer information. it was tedious work. I went through about 4500 records, sorting and updating. My eyes were done with computers by the time I left.</description>
