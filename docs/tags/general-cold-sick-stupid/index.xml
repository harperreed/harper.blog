      <description>So I have been sick for the last month. It is starting to get really tiring. I am bored of being sick. At first, I was like &amp;ldquo;oh awesome&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep and I have a stuffy nose, what a new experience.&amp;rdquo; But now I am totally over the new cold feeling and just want it to go away. I even went to the doctor which is something I am totally against doing.</description>
