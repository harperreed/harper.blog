      <description>so this mornign at 7 we started launching a site at work. I was sleeping. because last night was halloween. and I didn&amp;rsquo;t goto bed early. stupid satan.. always keeping me up. nothing is better than death metal at seven in the morning.Last night, after my work.. I hung out with hiromi and read. it was fun. then we went to reza&amp;rsquo;s - which is always good. after that we cabbed it up to winnies thing at park west.</description>
