      <description>so I am home. my parents picked me up from the airport and we went to eat at the cherry creek grill. it was nice. it was very colorado. afterwards I was driving and I went to shut a door and I cut my finger all up. so being home is nice. I really have njoyed hanging with my rents for the past month and will enjoy hanging out with them this coming month.</description>
