      <description>last night my friends and I went to this pretty nice resturant and had excellent food and free beer. the night was advertised as &amp;ldquo;unlimited intoxication&amp;rdquo; - which seemeingly is a misnomer. what does misnomer mean? so we hung out there and I had excellent tandori chicken kabobs and lotsa fish. it all ruled oh so much. good good food. then suresh and I went to a club called spin. apparently there is only about 50 things globally that you are allowed to call a club.</description>
