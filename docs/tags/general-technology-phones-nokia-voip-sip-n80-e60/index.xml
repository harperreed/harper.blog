      <description>I was talking to my &amp;ldquo;phone connection&amp;rdquo; and it looks as though the nokia N80 is out in the wild. You can check it out here. The N80 seems like a pretty cool phone. it has all the features that one could possibly want - good camera, good os, good form factor and wifi.
I think for me the selling point is the wifi. Although on the N80 you are unable to use the phone as a VOIP SIP device, it would still be one of the coolest things ever.</description>
