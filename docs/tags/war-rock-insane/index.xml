      <description>Today I had another battle: me vs. pseudo-ephedrine and caffiene. I lost the battle, however I won the war. I finally got some nyquil so maybe I will actually sleep. I keep having waves of absolute exhaustion wash over me. woah. it is insane. But I am propping myself up against my cube with the sticks I collected at lunch and attempting to seem busy.speaking of busy - I seriously rocked a meeting this morning/early afternoon.</description>
