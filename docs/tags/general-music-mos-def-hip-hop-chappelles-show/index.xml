      <description>Mos def is one of my favorite artists and &#34;Whats Beef&#34; is one of my favorite songs with him and Talib Kweli. Check out the video from chappelle&#39;s show. This one is also really good.
Someday i will meet mos def and i will say &#34;Yo Mos. I really like your work&#34; and he will look at me and say &#34;no problem. anytime.&#34; </description>
