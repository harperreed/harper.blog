      <description>tonight I am going to dinner with morgan. it is kinda weird. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen her since we broke up. I am a bit apprenhensive - not really about seeing her. just about the whole situation. it is kinda scary. haha. I am glad, however that it is scary by design and not scary or uncomfortable because I happened to run in to her randomly. we have been talking on email - so it shoudln&amp;rsquo;t be too uncomfortable.</description>
