      <description>Tomorrow is the 2006 General Election. You need to vote. It is very important. I think voting is very exciting. Even though I am sometimes bummed by the outcome - I love participating in our countries politics and influence policy. It rules. I have voted in every election since I was able to first vote in 1996. And it is still a little bit magic to get in line and do whatever you need to do to submit your vote.</description>
