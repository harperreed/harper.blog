      <description>I have released my first wordpress plugin. It allows a user to take the public shared calendar feed from goodle calendar and display it in a useful fashion on their wordpress blog.
You can see the result of the plugin here: my calendar
you can download it here: gcal.tar.gz
read about it more here: plugin page
Let me know if you have any suggestions or any bugs. Feel free to leave comments or email me at harper @ nata2.</description>

      <description>I have cleaned up and commented a little hack i did for my home asterisk server - allowing a person to dial an extension and then be walked through spoofing caller id on a call. It is a ridiculously easy hack to engage. I was surprised and a bit concerned at what this means in regards to trust and telephony. I mean, if a hobbyist is able to spoof caller id on a phone call to anywhere with nothing more than asterisk@home and vmware.</description>
