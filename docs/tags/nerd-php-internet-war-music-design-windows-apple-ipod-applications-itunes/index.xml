      <description>So I have been using itunes for around 24 hours now. I have come to the conclusion that we in the PC world are lucky. We have a plethora of software made by a very diverse set of vendors - all of who struggle.. so each product ends up having its own variation on the solution.. they each have unique features.. and eventually one or two products win. The PC software world seems to be based a bit more on the evolution of the solution.</description>
