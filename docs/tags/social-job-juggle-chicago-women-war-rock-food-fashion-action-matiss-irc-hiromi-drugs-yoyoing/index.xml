      <description>so this weekend ruled. my friend marica took me to tango heh. yep. that is correct. I had forgotten how much I enjoy to dance ballroom style. it is a lot of fun. so on saturday I slept a bit, did laundry and watched a movie called gia. It was quite sad. We watched it mid day.. so then going out and hanging with a bunch of rocker kids was quite weird - it seems that often their goal is to have the life that gia led.</description>
