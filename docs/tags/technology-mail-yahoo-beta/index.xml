      <description>I used this awesome trick to get on the yahoo mail beta. it is pretty cool. a nice rich interface for mail. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it as much as gmail - but it is really nice. I think gmail seems snappier - but it may just be the amount of color and &amp;ldquo;chrome&amp;rdquo; that yahoo man versus the minimal interface that gmail is offering.
If anyone would like to try out the beta themselves just follow these instructions: How to change your content preference:  log in to Yahoo Mail click Options select Account information from the left panel go to Member Information, General Preferences, Preferred Content select, for example, Yahoo UK click Finished go to Yahoo Mail you&amp;rsquo;ll see a page that says &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the New Yahoo!</description>
