      <description>i title many blgs tonight. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the deal is. So I am now twenty four. I had an ok birthday. It was nothing special - however I went and hung out at my favorite bar. Which is sorta fun. actually quite a bit of fun. matiss and I chilled there for awhile and watched crazy japanese snuff,rape,horror movies. not real good but an interesting view none the less.</description>
