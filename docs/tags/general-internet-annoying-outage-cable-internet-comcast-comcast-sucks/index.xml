      <description>My Comcast cable Internet&amp;nbsp;has been out 4 times in the last 2 months. It is killing me. When speakeasy used to go out (very rarely), I would call them and they would fix it. I never had to have a technician come to my home and check out my DSL modem. But with Comcast, every problem - even when they admit that it is probably in the wiring leading to the house - they insist on sending a technician and wasting my time.</description>
