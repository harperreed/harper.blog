      <description>its nuts. but i do love bluetooth. connecting to the internet magically while riding uncomfortably in a bus. haha
so i am going to madison wis, for a juggling festival. it will be a lot of fun. but i missed the 9 o clock bus because the trains broke down and i had to wait a long time. however - i was able to catch the 11pm one - which means that i iwll be arriving at the nice time of 2am.</description>
