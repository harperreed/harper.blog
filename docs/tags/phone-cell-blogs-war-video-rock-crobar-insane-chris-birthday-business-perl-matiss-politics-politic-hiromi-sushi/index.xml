      <description>so this weekend has been nice. on friday my coworkers and myself went to the hard rock cafe bar and met my friend winnie for drinks. she works there and was able to hook us up a bit which offset the billion dollars the drinks normally would have cost. it was a nice place. pretty chilled out - however around 5:30 - it started to get pretty full and crazy. after that I went and picked up some buttons at busy beaver.</description>
