      <description>arrrrgh..  i am pissed now.  i had a whole entry full of neat links and I accidently canceled it. stupid goddamn mouse. always clicking clicking clicking.Watch out! So anyway. I am bummed out. my parents were supposed to come in today - but since god hates us pagans - they are stuck in colorful colorado enjoying many inches of snow. Stupid airports.. always freezing and having to follow simple laws of weather.</description>
