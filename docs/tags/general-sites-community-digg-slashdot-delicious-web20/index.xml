      <description>I realized a minute ago that I haven&#39;t looked at slashdot in a month. That is really screwed up. I have been looking at slashdot for years. truly since the beginning of slashdot. I remember when they added users (I think). It has always been around. However, I just haven&#39;t been going to the site.&amp;nbsp; I have been reading del.icio.us or digg instead. its more rounded. I am less interested in news for nerds and much more interested in news.</description>
