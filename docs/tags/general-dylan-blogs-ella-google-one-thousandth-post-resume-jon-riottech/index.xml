      <description>Lots and lots of writing has taken place. it is pretty nuts. i have been blogging since march 1st 2000. it is pretty nuts. A lot of words. a lot of randomness. a HUGE number of rants and a couple emotions. hah. mostly just drivel. it rules. Since 2000 i have had two jobs, hosted probably 200 websites, gone to the grocery store maybe 50 times, read hundreds of books, had 7ish girlfriends, learned to speak italian, graduated from college, and ran around naked.</description>
