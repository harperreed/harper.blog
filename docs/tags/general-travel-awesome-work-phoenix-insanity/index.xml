      <description>the weather here is excellent. i likey. work is fun. the environment here is much more &amp;ldquo;low-key&amp;rdquo; than in chicago. the people are just as nice but everyone seems so much more chill. it is a great work vacation. i think they should send everyone here to recooooop. it rules. oh and it is really nice out. just yesterday i got sunburned. which isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly hard for me - since i get color walking to the train.</description>
