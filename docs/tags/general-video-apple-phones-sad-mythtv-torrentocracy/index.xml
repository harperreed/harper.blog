      <description>Watch this french commercial. I found it rather nice. In a sad sort of way. I like stuff like this. The last couple nights, I have watched the lord the rings trilogy. It is pretty awesome. I love it. I bought all the movies when they came out and had watched them sporadically after I owned them. But it is nice to sit and watch them in close proximity to the last one.</description>
