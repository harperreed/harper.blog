      <description>i totally didn&amp;rsquo;t know that my blog was public. haha. jk. so I was talking to my friend and she relayed information that my blog was the topic of a conversation in a meeting about rss feeds. I was used to demonstrate how &amp;ldquo;people need to keep in mind that anybody can read what you post.&amp;rdquo; this was apparently especially true in light of my post about me resigning. well. first off.</description>
