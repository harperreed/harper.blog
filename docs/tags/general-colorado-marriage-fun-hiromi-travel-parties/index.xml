      <description>So the other weekend, Hiromi and I went to colorado to celebrate our marriage with our friends and family. It was fun. It was a party a year in the waiting. We had a ton of friends come and had some really nice parties at my parents house. Only a little bit of mayhem and pretty much an awesome time all around. It all started on Wednesday night. Hiromi and I flew to Denver.</description>
