      <description>Sorry i have been in such a &amp;ldquo;not blogging&amp;rdquo; mood, but i have been in a real bad state since i got back. I got back last saturday and of course was jet-lagged. As soon as that was over i realized that i had contrated some space cold from either the plane, the train or matiss. So i basically spent the last week at work and then at home sleeping or reading or eating my new fancy ramen soup combo pasta surprise.</description>
