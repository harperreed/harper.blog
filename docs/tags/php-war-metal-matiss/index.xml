      <description>oh yea. this weekend. hmm.. well one of the past three days.. I fell asleep listening to Sunn 0)) (a very sludge doom metal sound). anyway.. I was listening to them.. well really sleeping to them.. and my dreams were infused with chaos. I had three very violent war dreams in quick succession. All three took place in my grandfathers hometown. The first was about being invaded and put into a camp.</description>
