      <description>So I got my computer set up at work. Its nice to finally be able to check email, catch up on my news and generally get my Internet presence back. Now that I can hang out on the Internet - work is starting to seem more like work and less like a crazy place. Everything is starting to come together. I can&#39;t wait for our office to be done. Its going to be awesome when we get our conference room, tables and other furniture.</description>
