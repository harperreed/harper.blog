      <description>Barack Obama seems to have won the democratic nomination. After all the time and work we all put into his campaign, I am VERY happy to hear this news.
I am more happy that Hilary Clinton didn&amp;rsquo;t win. She was really hurting my insides me with all the negative campaigning. I did not like how attacky she got in the end. I hope that she is done being annoying.
Now is the time to start supporting the Barack Obama, and the democratic party to defeat John McCain in November.</description>
