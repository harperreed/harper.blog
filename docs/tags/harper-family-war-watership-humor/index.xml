      <description>i was so weird yesterday. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be at work. so I just did my work without mentioning a word to anyone - and I reacted poorly when I was spoken too. it was annoying even to me.. I guess I was coming down from the high of my awesome (and tiring) weekend. I just wanted to go home and get a hug from someone. or go home and sleep (which is essentially what I did).</description>
