      <description>I am listening the refused. I enjoy them quite a bit. I have a new project going. Well I have a couple. I have mentioned both of them on here before. The first is riottech, my little concert listing. I rule. hehe. the second is the /3gscreensaver.com. The phone sites are a lot more interesting.. but riottech is more fun. The phone site is a great experiement in community digital rigths management.</description>
