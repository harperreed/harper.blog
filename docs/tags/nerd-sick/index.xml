      <description>Today I didn&amp;rsquo;t goto work. I was sick and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I could make it through a whole day of work. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been eating all that well.. and it was reflected by my bodies giving up and telling me to fuck off .. heh .. yea that is pretty much how it went ;) so I slept until 5:30&amp;hellip; which was weird - cuzi planned on coming in to work after 1:00 - but whatever.</description>
