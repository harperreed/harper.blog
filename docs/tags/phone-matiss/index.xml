      <description>I remember when a friend of mine used to allude to my relationships as weather. He would ask how the weather was. I would always respond with some equally vague answer. It was fun. Today I went to watch breakdancing. It would have been fun, if it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been canceled. suxors. However. rigth before break dancing I talked to a new friend on the phone for quite awhile. It was nice.</description>
