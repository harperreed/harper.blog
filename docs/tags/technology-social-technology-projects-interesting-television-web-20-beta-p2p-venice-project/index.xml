      <description>The Venice Project is a P2P social television project by the guys who made Skype. They are really into disruptive technologies and I am excited to be a part of the beta. You can get more information at the Venice Project wikipedia page.
I am pretty excited to see how it goes. I played with it a second here at work - but yea know. watching television at work isn&amp;rsquo;t really the best way to get things done.</description>
