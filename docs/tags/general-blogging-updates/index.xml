      <description>It has been a minute since I have blogged regularly. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know why - but for some reason, I just haven&amp;rsquo;t felt like blogging. I think this happens when a lot of going on in my life. Recently I have been really slammed with various projects outside of work and have been doing really exciting stuff inside of work. Mostly tech stuff, but it is all very interesting and quite engaging.</description>
