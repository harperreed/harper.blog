      <description>So i have been in chicago barely 12 hours. I slept 5 hours. And went to clubs for 7 hours. It was awesome. But the real reason i love chicago is the strict diversity that is celebrated at every turn. At every stop you see different people doing different things. All rocking it.
Tonight:
We started at sushi wabi. I had a steak - cuz i had just had excellent sashimi and sushi in tokyo and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to taint my memory with paltry really good sushi.</description>
