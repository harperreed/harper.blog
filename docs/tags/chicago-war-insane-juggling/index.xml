      <description>whoa. I hope nothing like that ever happens to me. that would not be as fun. I would be said. especially if we were juggling and I caught a knife with my eye or something. we would probably have to stop the performance. I am sad.. iron maiden is touring in europe. I only hope that they swing by chicago.. :( hopefully.. my dream would come true.. finally. In other news.</description>
