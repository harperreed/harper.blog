      <description>I just watched the korean movie oldboy (read this if you want to ruin the movie). Jesus Christ that movie is insane. I was not ready for the endeavor of watching that movie. Quite something. I rather enjoyed it. I am a sucker for movies that have good soundtracks. The story blew my mind. I had no idea it was going to become what it became. Whew. I have owned it for a number of years and just finally got around to watching it.</description>
