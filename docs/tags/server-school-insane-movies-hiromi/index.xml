      <description>So this weekend was rather nice. On friday, some friends and I went and saw once upon a time in mexico. it was really fun. I love johnny depp. there was a lot of crazy violence. it was insane. blown knees and all. then hiromi, lavi and I went to dinner. hiromi and I went and visited marcia - but we were all so tired. so we went home. I was asleep by 12 oclock on friday.</description>
