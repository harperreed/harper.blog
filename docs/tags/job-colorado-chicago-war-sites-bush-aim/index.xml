      <description>So one year ago about now I was arriving at work and noticed how everyone was leaving. a friend had woke me up early to tell me about the first plane.. and then the second. it was weird.. I learned about most of this on AIM. So I then went to work. Like I said.. all I remember was all the people streaming out of buildings. I came to my office sat there.</description>
