      <description>I woke up and attempted my hardest to not make it to work. however, much to my chagrin, I now find myself at work. on the way in - I listened to midnight oil&amp;rsquo;s diesel and dust. I have been listening to music from my past lately. it is pretty fun. yesterday I purchased a bunch of crosby and nash and then a bunch of neil young. both are so so good.</description>
