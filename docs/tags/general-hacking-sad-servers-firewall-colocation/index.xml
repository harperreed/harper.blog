      <description>Man today sucked. Seriously. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a BAD day in years. today. today was a bad day. I woke up and got in the shower. Got dressed. check my email. checked my text messages. and i had a txt from my buddy mike telling me my server was broke. so i checked it out. i couldn&amp;rsquo;t ssh into it or anything - which is very very unusual. I have never been able to not connect at all.</description>
