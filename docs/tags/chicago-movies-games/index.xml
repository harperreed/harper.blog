      <description>So I have this car and I hate driving it. I never hated it before I moved to chicago. it is just so annoying.. parking and all that crap along with trying to navigate the crazy system that is chicago traffic&amp;hellip; whatever.. and now I have to license, insure and all that crap.. whatever whatever whatever.. heh.one nice thing about driving that you don&amp;rsquo;t have as much with the train - is you can stop and get things on the way.</description>
