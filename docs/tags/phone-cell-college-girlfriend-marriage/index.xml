      <description>So my girlfriend and myself have been dating 10 months. That is a real long time for me. I mean it is nothing compared to some lucky peoples marriage, but it is like 80% of a year, 304 days, a little over 1 million seconds(i think :)). So anyway, i am excited to go and see her at college. Hopefully all goes well and i get to go visit. I miss her terribly.</description>
