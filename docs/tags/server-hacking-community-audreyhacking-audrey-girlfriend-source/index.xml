      <description>So. Today has been great so far. My girlfriend is visiting later, I have a BIG meeting and presentation for work in a couple hours. and to top it all off, while I was reading my favorite new source, I noticed this article which linked to my website. It is rather exciting to help build and foster a community. Man this is great. And my server hasn&amp;rsquo;t even noticed.. hehe</description>
