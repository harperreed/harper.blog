      <description>there is a thunderstorm outside. its november. wtf.
i am sick. i haven&amp;rsquo;t gone out in awhile. i have slept a LOT. a whole LOT. and cleaned. and got really fast cable internet. DSL is lame. i am sad - cuz i really liked speakeasy. but they were too expensive and cable was so easy and damned damned fast. i peak at like 7000kbps. that shit is nuts. NUTS.
