      <description>hehe. Yesterday ruled. I got up at around 1:30 or so and called my mom. w00t. then I went to lula with matiss, beck, eleni and silvia. We hung out until around 3:30 and had an incredible meal. I think I had catfish and eggs and then shared a bunch of desert with my friends. so so good. we then went back to my apartment and watched a studio ghibli movie called Nausica?</description>
