      <description>Today is my 25th birthday. I am happy. Last night I hung out with a bunch of cool cats and we went to iggy&amp;rsquo;s and ate dinner. we got there about 11:50 so it was a good time. I drank beer and coke - not together.. mind you.. I am not like some of my friends.. hehe.. ;). it was fun. they sang happy birthday to me.. and succeeded in embarrasing me slightly.</description>
