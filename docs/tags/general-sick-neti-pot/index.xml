      <description>So today after running some errands downtown i came home and about died. I slept like a baby until around 10. confused and hungry i awoke. I felt like hell still. which sucked. I was totally (totally dude) supposed to go to a bbq around 7. But i just didn&amp;rsquo;t have it in me. and now its 11:39 and i am still achey and tired.
However, after i ate and chilled for a minute, i decided to try the neti pot again.</description>
