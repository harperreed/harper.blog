      <description>this is a long entry heh. I wish I really was a darksider. I have had some really weird dreams the past couple days. first I had a dream I was in a bad place. the place was a bed and the other person in the bed didn&amp;rsquo;t want me there but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t leave - so I was attempting to stay on the edge of the bed the whole night.</description>
