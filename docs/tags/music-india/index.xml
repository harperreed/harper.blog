      <description>i hate feelings. I hate how small things can cause such weird reverberations within my self. it is hard. I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep. it hasn&amp;rsquo;t anything to do with anything. I just lay down. and I look at the ceiling. and I get kinda sad. not really depressed or pointedly sad. just a sinking feeling. like. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is going on in my head. but I do know. it isn&amp;rsquo;t really all that weird.</description>
