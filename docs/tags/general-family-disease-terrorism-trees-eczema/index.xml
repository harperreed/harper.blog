      <description>Today I found out that my dad was placed into the hospital to help him fight his infidel skin. Basically he has what is colloquially known as &amp;ldquo;extreme eczema,&amp;rdquo; but basically it seems that his skin is attempting to hijack his body and run it into a building. So with that in mind, he went to get himself checked out.
During his check out, the doctor was like &amp;ldquo;OMG. Yours skin is at terror alert red.</description>
