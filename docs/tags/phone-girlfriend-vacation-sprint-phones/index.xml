      <description>So today I got up.. got right to work. did a little bit of financial planning.. played with bank statements and suddenly noticed a very large charge from sprintpcs. so I called them and they suck. really. they suck so so much. they alleged that I received two phones, started a new service contract and then canceled. thus invoking about $600 of charges. So I talked to them and they have a different &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; on what happened and refuse to refund 400 of the 600.</description>
