      <description>So i got gmail back this morning. had a bundle of mail that i didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see yesterday. weird. What was really annoying was that google didn&amp;rsquo;t respond and that there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a response before. It just seems that they are ignoring a problem. Even if they were like &amp;ldquo;oh your email is broken until tomorrow&amp;rdquo; that would be better. it was rather frustrating..
maybe it is time to move to yahoo.</description>
