      <description>So hiromi and I went to dinner at this really great place called irazu. It was nice. I enjoyed it. afterwards we went to a nice coffee shop and got some coffee.. I planned for this -cuz I brought my laptop&amp;hellip; so I could get some work done. I also brought my vision connection kit so I could use my cell phone as a modem and rule!!! however.. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the bastard to work.</description>
