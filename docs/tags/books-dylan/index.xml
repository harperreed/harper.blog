      <description>i read &amp;ldquo;dance dance dance&amp;rdquo; by murakami last night. it was pretty creepy. for some reason these books really give me the creeps. it is nuts. totally totally nuts ;). but I really liked it too. which is good. yesterday we had dylans &amp;ldquo;bachelor party.&amp;rdquo; it was pretty fun. we had a HUGE bottle of vueve and a party bus and a bunch of fancy drinks. dylan and his friends were fun.</description>
