      <description>with the US targeting a bit of aggression towards france.. I am reminded of my dream of nuclear war. Ever since I saw red dawn when I was little - I have been scared of world war. and now we get our chance. I hope we don&amp;rsquo;t screw this up. I am not really crazy. I just think that our world is inane rigth now and needs some humor in it.</description>
