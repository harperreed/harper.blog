      <description>i worked. and then I went and got my hair trimmed. haha. I mean shorn. after that I came home and PASSED out. it ruled. slept until about 9 or 10. ordered some food. watched &amp;lsquo;bend it like beckham&amp;rsquo; and then watched &amp;lsquo;platonic sex.&amp;rsquo; both were quite good. &amp;lsquo;bend it like beckham&amp;rsquo; was really funny - I really liked it. sorta dumb - but really nice. &amp;lsquo;platonic sex&amp;rsquo; was quite good - incredibly weird.</description>
