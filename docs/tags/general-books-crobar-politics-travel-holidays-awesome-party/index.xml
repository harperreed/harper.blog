      <description>So i haven&amp;rsquo;t updated in awhile. that is.. i haven&amp;rsquo;t updated since the beginning of thanksgiving weekend. Oh what a weekend it was. Filled with unimaginable excitment and fun.
On wednesday i arriveed. my mother had made all of us kids (dylan, jon, me, sarah, and my cousins) fur vests. Most of them were wolverine fur, but some were from some fantasy animal. They are awesome. So we donned our fur vests and continued to rule for the weekend.</description>
