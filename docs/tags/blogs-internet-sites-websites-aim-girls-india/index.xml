      <description>so my friend from work, lakshmi, is leaving on monday to go back to india. it is kinda sad. she is one of my favorite coworkers. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it was truely happening until I read her entry about work and the disengagement from sait work. apparently I swear. but it is kinda weird to think about. because it is so different from another coworker leaving or a friend moving - because she is going to india.</description>
