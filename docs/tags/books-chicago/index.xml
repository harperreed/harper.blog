      <description>Today i went to the art institute of chicago and looked at the contemporary and modern paintings&amp;hellip; it was bad ass.. anyway i also looked at some of the oldest books i have ever read. I started with a book published in the early 18th century(1722) about the plurality of worlds, it was qute something.. i have never read a book that was so informal. And the secod set of books were translations of the 17th century philosopher named&amp;hellip; well i forgot but the book s were translated into english about 1640 or so&amp;hellip; damn old books, smell ed bad&amp;hellip; but whatever&amp;hellip;</description>
