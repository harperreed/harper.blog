      <description>Last night at juggling club. I got into an argument with a strange suburban man who had good ideas, but was really stuck on how capitalism is evil. I am unable to work in that paradigm. I cannot think that capitalism is the evil. I think the how capitalism is executed can be bad, exploitive and destructive.. but that is not the failt of capiitalism. It is the fault of the executor.</description>
