      <description>i can&amp;rsquo;t seem to sleep. I mean. I did take a nap from 10:00-12:00 haha. it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much as a nap as much as it was an alcohol enforced sleep. heh. the plan was to have all of our friends meet us at the bar that is really close to my house. it worked very well. we got there around 4:30 and left around 8:00. we had pizza there and bunchs of tequila shots.</description>
