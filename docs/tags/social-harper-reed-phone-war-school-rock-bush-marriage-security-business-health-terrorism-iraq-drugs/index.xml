      <description>is such a hippie that he is concerned about that &amp;ldquo;fad&amp;rdquo; called global warming. apparently some big chuck of ice broke and now everyone is all scared. it is supposed to be some proof that global warming is real. But nobody knows for sure. I guess we need proof. It is a good thing our government is looking out for us.. oh and I love bush. I will just mark global warming as one of the many many things that scares the hell out of me.</description>
