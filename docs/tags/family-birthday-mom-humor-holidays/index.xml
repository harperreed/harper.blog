      <description>I had a good weekend. I hung out all sorts of good friends and heard the downlow on everyones holiday. What a nice thing holidays are. I need another one so I don&amp;rsquo;t get so sleepy. ;) On saturday miriam and myself went to a rather humorous play called &amp;ldquo;cooking with elvis.&amp;rdquo; It was quite interesting and had some very funny moments - it was also slightly depressing.. about family dysfunction and the like.</description>
