      <description>i love the internet. Awhile back I posted 60X1.com, I finally took the time to finish it and much to my chagrin it led me to some amazing sites: tinkin - this is the guy who made 60X1.com he has a bunch of really great anti war stuff. it is so good. it makes me happy I want to give this site to everyone as a gift. I think that politics is often forgotten when it comes to internet art.</description>
