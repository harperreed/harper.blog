      <description>I have been waking up earlier lately. it is rather strange. I am still a bit late to work(9:10&amp;frasl;15), but I am up longer and feel better. weird. maybe it is cuz I don&amp;rsquo;t go out EVERY NIGHT. heh. umm.. yea.. well I have been workign a lot on this ringtone stuff.. it is fun. but I have to plan a lot to make sure it is robust. stupid robustness. I hate you so much ;).</description>
