      <description>So i got back this morning. i wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to sleep or anything so i went on the needed journey to get some project pieces and tools. I went to radio shack and home depot. all by walking. it was pretty awesome. i am now really tired. i imagine later tonight i will through up a play by play of my time in tokyo with hiromi. but for now i am going to throw up a play by play of me sleeping.</description>
