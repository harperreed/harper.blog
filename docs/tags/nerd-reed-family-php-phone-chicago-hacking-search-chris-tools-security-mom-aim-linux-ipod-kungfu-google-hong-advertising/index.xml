      <description>so a week or so ago I went to this party for the chicago thong organization, it was really funny and strange - but my friend chris and I participated in the activities and wore thongs and capes(which was the costume of choice). well later that night we were at a club and one of our friends snapped this really great shot of my ass. when I got to work on monday and saw it - I thought immediately how fun(and funny) it would be to send it to my parents in a really nice frame.</description>
