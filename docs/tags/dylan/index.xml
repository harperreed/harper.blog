      <description>my brother came over this weekend from LA. It was great. We hung out a bunch and generally chilled out. It was nice to hang out when we are older..
 One of the most interesting things about this weekend was the strange occurance of people asking us which one of us is older. I guess it is because we are now similarly sized and full grown.. or there about. it was interesting.</description>
