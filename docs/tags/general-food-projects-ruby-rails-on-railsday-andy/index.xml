      <description>So andy and i did rails day on saturday. It was quite an experience. We started about 10am and worked until about 6pm. We got almost the entire way through the application with some MAJOR pieces missing - but not so bad for barely 8 hours or whatever. we totally coudl have finished if we would have actually used the 24 hours. but we have lives. haha. and we are not super ruby peeps.</description>
