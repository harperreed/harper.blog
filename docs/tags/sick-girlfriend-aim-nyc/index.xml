      <description>this is pretty funny. as is this. I made a bunch of entries today. this is nice.i talked to morgan a couple tiems today on aim. it is kinda weird. with every conversation my feelngs and emotions start bouncing up and down. it is like I am getting beat up and I get to dodge fifty percent of the punchs. on one side I totally understand how this sort of thing happens.</description>
