      <description>So i was working with seth - wrapping up my summer gig and hanging out a bit. and he was telling me that he was going to throw out some water damaged audiophile equipment that he had laying around. He then offered me the equipment - and i of course said YES.
Ever since i was a child i have had a nack of gathering broke ass audio equipment - whether it be HUGE 18&amp;rdquo; bass cabinets or a 60s reverb box, i have always had a nack of getting some great stuff.</description>
