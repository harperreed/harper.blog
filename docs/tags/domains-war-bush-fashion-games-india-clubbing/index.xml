      <description>so last night vinay and myself hung around bangalore and went to different catholic churches. I met his wife and his mother and we just chilled out. it was nice and relaxing. I was in bed by 10 and asleep by 10:15. hah. the churches were pretty cool. they are all very majestic and quite something. it was as I expected - a mix of indian and western stylings. vinay&amp;rsquo;s favorite was the best one.</description>
