      <description>It has been a week, and I am still reveling in how much fun we had. Lollapalooza has always been really fun. I have enjoyed going to the shows since I started in 92. There were a few rough spots here and there (I.e. after 98) but lollapalooza has turned out to be an amazing event. And its even more amazing that it is a HUGE event in Chicago. Awesome. It all started on Thursday night when Hiromi and I hung out with Derek and his family.</description>
