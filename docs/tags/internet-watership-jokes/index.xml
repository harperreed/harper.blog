      <description>so today I had a weird day at work. nothing happened - I just felt weird. so I went home and attempted to take a nap to relax myself. but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep. I needed to just screw around or hang out and say stupid shit to people. so I got matt and we walked to the local bar. it ruled. we drank $20 worth of beer - which on an empty stomach is PLENTY.</description>
