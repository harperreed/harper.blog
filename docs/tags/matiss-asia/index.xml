      <description>Today I walked all around downtown. it was quite fun. I got a couple sweat shirts at diesel and genreally hung out. We went and ate lunch at some asian place and watched the simpsons. it was nice. Matiss has a friend staying for a couple days.. so it has been quite fun to hang out with her. our house is goign to be rather full for the next couple days.</description>
