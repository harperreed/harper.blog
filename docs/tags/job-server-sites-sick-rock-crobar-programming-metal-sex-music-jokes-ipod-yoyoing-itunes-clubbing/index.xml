      <description>i hate being sick. it totally blows. I love black metal. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know how they are related. but I have listened to black metal for the last couple months. and it rules. today was all emporer. i got bored of choosign music for my ipod - so I let itunes do it this time. it did a pretty good job. I am proud. anyway. last night I played yoyo and cleaned my room.</description>
