      <description>I am freezing. Seriously. It suddenly got like 100 below zero up in this piece. But never fear. i have a coat. and i will where it when i go outside. Which doesn&amp;rsquo;t help me while i am cold here in my living room. hah. last night or maybe it was the previous night - i was ready for snow. but now that it is colder than it was, i am not ready for snow.</description>
