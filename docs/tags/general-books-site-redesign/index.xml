      <description>so i accidently spent like 100 hours in the last month reading this goddamn scifi series. It was super annoying. really good stuff. but a really bad author. well not really bad. but not very good. all the reviews said that when reading the series - you can&amp;rsquo;t wait a very long time between books because the plot is so thin. so true. but the story is great. but now i am done.</description>
