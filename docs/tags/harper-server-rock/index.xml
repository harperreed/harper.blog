      <description>anyway.. yesterday - I ruled it up. I worked really hard at work.. fixed a couple servers.. broke a couple firewalls.. programmed a couple web apps. and then went home. took a nap. a long nap. made really good progress on my other work. did a bunch of cool stuff there and then.. went to innjoy and hung with some friends.. and then went to rockatiki.. which sucked.. sorta. it was kinda cool.</description>
