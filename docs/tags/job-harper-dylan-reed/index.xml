Hi,  I&amp;rsquo;m a friend of Harper&amp;rsquo;s, and he was telling me about your diving job. We began to wonder a couple of things about diving.  For instance, if you had to fight a monkey underwater, assuming that the monkey was a well trained diver (he&amp;rsquo;s a natural in the water and very athletic), and the monkey was equipped with a knife and the necessary skills to use it, who would win this battle?</description>
