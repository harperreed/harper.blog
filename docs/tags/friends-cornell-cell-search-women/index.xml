      <description>Man.. i don&amp;rsquo;t know whats going on. I had the wierdest dreams recently. both of them involved the &amp;ldquo;weather.&amp;rdquo; In one i was walking from cedar rapids to Mt. Vernon, and i was following a tornado. So everything was destroyed&amp;hellip; then when i got to cornell, the tornado had somehow turned all of the &amp;ldquo;jocks&amp;rdquo; into vampires&amp;hellip; it was really funny. it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just jocks persay, but that is all i remember as now.</description>
