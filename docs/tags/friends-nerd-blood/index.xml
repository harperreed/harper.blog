      <description>i really don&amp;rsquo;t know if i like anime or not. At first the fascination was based on experiencing something i had never experienced before. Then it got wierd. I kinda liked it because i was supposed to like it - according to the code of computer nerd. But now i am starting to get more into it. I just saw blood and it was really good. It was by the guys who did ghost in the shell, which i really enjoy.</description>
