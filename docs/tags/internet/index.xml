      <description>a couple minutes ago I was almost.. wait.. I was hit by a car. it was going very very slow. but it totally made contact with my body. luckily it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going fast - as I would be dead. hehe. it ruled. then my coworkers made fun of me for being an internet only person. I think the quote was &amp;ldquo;basketball, one of the things you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know about cuz it isn&amp;rsquo;t on the internet.</description>

      <description>Ha.. Well after numerous people have asked.. I did have a rough time lately. however I am ok now. I was just sad for a breif period and everyone left. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to reflect off of, or to talk to, so I used the wonderful internet and the lovely &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; to be my emotional reflection pool. thanks for the support.</description>
