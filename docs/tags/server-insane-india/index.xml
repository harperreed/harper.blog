      <description>since I last updated this page. On thursday.. I found out that I would be accompanying a bunch of servers to vienna, virginia in an emergency server upgrade. So I went and rented a car, got servers from one colo facility and brought them to virginia. We drove a bundle of hours.. went through indiana, ohio, pennsylvania, maryland, virginia and Washington DC. We ended up staying right across from the target data center and so the server delivivery was insanly easy.</description>
