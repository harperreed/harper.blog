      <description>For some reason my google talk is broken for my person gmail account. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t log me in while i am in gmail, or gaim, or even using their gtalk client. Its really weird - because if i log in using another account - it works fine. But if i log in using my primary account. its broken. So annoying. Especially because people are starting to adopt google talk as a more de facto way of contacting peeps.</description>
