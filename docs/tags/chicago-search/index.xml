      <description>Tomorrow I will arrive in boston for search engine training. I am excited but rather bummed that I will be going. I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to leave chicago.. my friend miriam is leavign for cologne on sunday and I would like time to spend with her before she leaves.. alas.. I guess I will have to wait and spend time later.. but that is why it sucks.. cuz later she will be in germany.</description>
