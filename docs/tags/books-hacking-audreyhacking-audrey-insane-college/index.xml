      <description>so yesterday I read two books. it was madness. I just needed that stimulation I guess..
first I read Angels &amp;amp; Demons by Dan Brown. It was pretty good. a very nice read. I felt that it was similar to those science/medical fiction books that are use a hihg base level of knowledge about the subject&amp;hellip; the jargon I guess.. however Brown&amp;rsquo;s book is about catholicism, the vatican and such.. which makes it really fun to read - since I studied all of that crap in college.</description>
