I think rachel is gunna give me this old bike of hears. I will prolly paint penises all over it and call it the &amp;ldquo;cock rocket&amp;rdquo; - umm&amp;hellip; I mean.. yea&amp;hellip; so after I hung out with rachel - I took a nap. I had meant to goto starsky and hutch - which is playing at the logan - but I accidently slept until 9:30.</description>
