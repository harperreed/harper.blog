      <description>The other day I was on flickr and I happened across a friend&amp;rsquo;s picture of things that he carries in his pockets. I thought it was really neat. He had linked to the photo pool that had a bundle of people following suit. It is amazing. I immediately took a picture of the things I carry around on me on a daily basis.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of fancy things.</description>
