      <description>seriously. it is a crazy mess. it just exploded the other day and I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance or drive to fix it. so the ipod mini is incredible. so tiny. it really is awesome. as you can see it is quite a bit smaller than the regular ipod. it came with the crappy generic white apple headphones. I was hopeing for the fancy smancy in ear ones. but noooo&amp;hellip; it did however come with a really nifty belt clip.</description>
