      <description>I really want a robot. I always have. I would love to have one of the AIBOs, or any number of iterations. I think, however I really want one of the new sony &amp;lsquo;bots. they seem to be real cool and very expensive. but I plan to be wealthy someday&amp;hellip; someday..</description>

      <description>So I have seen this site around the net for awhile and I went to it a couple time but it didn&amp;rsquo;t really make any sense. So today I read some of the stories and boy are they funny. I laughed a lot. a whole whole lot. damned funny if you ask me. It is about a crazy man in charge of a video game store, and his antics with really dumb customers.</description>
