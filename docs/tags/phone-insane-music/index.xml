      <description>last night I had another apocalyptic dream.. I really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say another.. it isn&amp;rsquo;t like they are repeating.. the last one was two years ago or so. but they are insane and kinda fun. this one started out with me being in a symphonic band practice. I was playing bari-sax.. I was not good - so the band director yelled at me. I was sad. but for some reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the music we were attempting to sight-read.</description>
