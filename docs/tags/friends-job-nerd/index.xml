      <description>So i was reading the New Yorker Magazine when i noticed that all of the cartoons were making fun of .coms failing. And then i noticed that all my computer nerd friends who aren&amp;rsquo;t working for an insurance company or working for a hardcore company are getting fired and not getting jobs. All my friends that are graduating are not getting hired. I have a job at a non-tech .com, and many of my friends are getting offered small time contract work.</description>
