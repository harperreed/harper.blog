      <description>so. things didn&amp;rsquo;t get better. that is for sure. sometimes I hate rationality. I wish I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to speak in riddles and not make sense. today is my birthday. I am probably going to sleep a lot. maybe goto dinner. nobody knows. i need some rest. it was an eventful and unrestful night. i am kinda sad.</description>
