      <description>So today I am supra busy at work. I have to do allll of this stuff that generally would be quite annoying.. hoever it is leading to a &amp;ldquo;better time&amp;rdquo; and will make work a lot more bareable - so I guess that is &amp;lsquo;ok.&amp;rsquo; Umm yea. I am eating an artichoke, chicken, mushroom rap.. listening to horrible trance and being bombarded with hotornot entries from all directions. what fun. i am really excited to get my new ipod.</description>
