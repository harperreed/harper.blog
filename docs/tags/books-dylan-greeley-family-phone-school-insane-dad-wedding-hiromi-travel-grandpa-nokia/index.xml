      <description>So this weekend was pretty cool. I am reading another good japanese book. I have no idea why I am reading all the japanese dark ficiton I can get my hands on. I am currently reading Goodbye Tsugumi. it is pretty bleak. I like it. next I got like 3 murakami books waiting. hah. I am a dork. I like shotgun reading. it totally suits me. after I read a bit and wrapped up my unpacking - I watched mystic river - which I stole from my parents (i promise I will send them back soon :P).</description>
