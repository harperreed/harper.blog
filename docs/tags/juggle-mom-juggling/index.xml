      <description>so madfest ruled this weekend. I had a bunch of fun. on friday - I picked my mom, brother and sarah up from the airport adn picked up our rental car. the car happened to be the largest car I have ever driven - a ford expedition. it was huge. I felt like I was in a semi. heh. but we all piled in and drove to brads house and picked him up.</description>
