      <description>so a couple days a go I really screwed up my photolog. it sucked - because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that I had screwed it up until I lost a bunch of picture that morgan took when I was insane. now they are gone forever. how sad. but anyway.. it is now fixed. I figured it out - basically when I was cleaning out nata2.info I inadvertently changed the permissions on the dir that the photolog puts the photos in.</description>
