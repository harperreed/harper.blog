      <description>I have decided that the reason the 3rd of july is so big is that chicago is a working city. a city where eveyone get the 4th off, but most don&amp;rsquo;t have th 5th off. so they go an party on the 3rd - cuz they don&amp;rsquo;t have to get up the next they. But they don&amp;rsquo;t want to on the 4th cuz they have to get up on the 5th.</description>
