      <description>so I got my mac mini. it came during my last blog entry. I was excited. of course. apple had to pack it all nice and such. I appreciate how minimal apples packaging is. although - it has become rather predictable. but is that bad? predictable packaging. it is not very big. i like the back. and I dislike the gargantuan powe supply. so dumb. &amp;hellip;more pictures laters. oh oh oh.</description>
