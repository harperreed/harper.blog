      <description>So I am in the market for a new laptop. I am currently using a Dell Inspiron 700M which I purchased a couple summers ago when I was doing freelance work. It has been a really good laptop and has gotten a lot of stuff done. So now that the customary 2 years has past, I am feeling the itch to upgrade to faster, cooler and much better machine.
My laptop is my primary computer.</description>
