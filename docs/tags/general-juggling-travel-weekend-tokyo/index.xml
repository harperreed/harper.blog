      <description>So this weekend was pretty fun. I just worked a bunch. Finished some stuff and played around a lot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go out much. On friday, Chris, Tag and myself went to see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&amp;rsquo;s Chest. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good or bad - but Cecil&amp;rsquo;s face was in it. that ruled. Afterward we went to Y bar and crobar. Simple night really.. On saturday i just hung out.</description>
