      <description>I work at a crazy place. No matter what the occasion or day there is something absolutely insane going on. Everyone at work is insanely creative, talented and generally amazing.

I&amp;nbsp;had this idea awhile back that I have been attempting to execute and I really want other to do it too - so I am going to share it here as an attempt to get it out and flush out some of the &amp;ldquo;rules.</description>
