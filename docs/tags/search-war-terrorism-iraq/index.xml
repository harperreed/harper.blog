      <description>I have a cynical view on terrorism. I feel that a lot of what we hear and see form the media.. could be government propaganda. I mean it also could be real. you really never know. Today is a good example. Sen. Patrick Leahy is investigating whether west nile virus is part of a terrorist plot. This could be a good chance for the government to just be like &amp;ldquo;yea it is&amp;hellip; and we need more money.</description>
