      <description>so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep again. I ended up finishng the book I started - which is always a good feeling. I ended up starting a second book.. but I put it away with fear that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t I woudl finish it too and it would be 8 in the morning. I suppose this is one of those days where I coudl afford to not sleep. but it would really wear on me.</description>
