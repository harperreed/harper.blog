      <description>omg I am a bit hung over. I am not even a lot hung over. I just don&amp;rsquo;t usually get hung over - so when I am - I am a baby about it. last night was a mess. it ruled. jon went out with friends - so kayne and I went to a art opening at heaven. there were some pretty good photographs and the like - it was nice.</description>
