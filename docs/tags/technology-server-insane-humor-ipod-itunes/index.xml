      <description>and freaked out a bit. I finally calmed down and found out that it will all be ok. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t freaking out about anything in particular. just freaking out. more of a nervous situation than anything. it was pretty weird. it is funny when you create scenerios in your head and they matter SOOO much - yet 15 minutes later you are like.. &amp;ldquo;ehh whatever.&amp;rdquo; basically I woke up, went home, saw that my servers where blowing up.</description>
