      <description>So today I went to a building that was a little over two blocks away to pick up a dell server(~$alot of money) that was mis-delievered to another company. heh. Like fed-ex &amp;ldquo;accidently&amp;rdquo; dropped it off at a completly unrelated place. wtf. and the best part is that the other company totally signed for it ;)hehehe.. I giggled the whole way. the best part was that we were totally incompentent at navigating the building.</description>
