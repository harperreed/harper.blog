      <description>it is true. recently a google employees side/personal project relaly took off. orkut is honestly what I felt friendster could have been . it doesn&amp;rsquo;t limit communication to on site. it lets you see the contact info for all your friends and maintain some form of community without limiting yourself to some shoddy infrastructure. I really like how you can create sub groups among your friends, create/be apart of a larger overall subgroup and rate your friends.</description>
