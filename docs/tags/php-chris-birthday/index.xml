      <description>today I installed my new router, looked over my taxes, accidently watched a really dumb movie and discussed white privilege with a friend. it was a good day.
check out these links: crazy pencil carvings from japan. this movie will be good. this bug is really big. ;). this comic is pretty incredible.read this article - then think about it. i am feeling good right now. which is really nice. I am excited for my birthday.</description>
