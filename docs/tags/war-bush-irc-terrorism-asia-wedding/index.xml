      <description>I laughed when I heard that the U.S. &amp;ldquo;finally&amp;rdquo; bombed a civilian target. I did not laugh because I find the killing of civilians to be funny, I laughed because of the ridiculousness of the entire situation. Of course we were bombing civilian targets. Of course we have killed thousands of afghans. this is, in my opinion, part of the war against terrorism that our illustrious president has so eloquently fought.</description>
