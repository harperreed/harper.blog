      <description>This weekend was a great time. I modeled in another fashion show. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I have any pictures as yet. I hope so. I met some rather cool cats, some I hope to see again. heh. I also went to some crazy frat boy bar and had free drinks and then found the crazy new meaning to &amp;ldquo;hungry drunk.&amp;rdquo; I also fixed my direct TV. heh. however, it is still sorta wack.</description>
