      <description>So i have been writing drafts of posts with windows live writer. It does a decent job. It makes blogging a bit more easy for peeps who don&amp;rsquo;t really like working in a browser. I think along with the flickr plugin - it may be a decent blog editor for people like my mom and dad, who are decent at computers but really don&amp;rsquo;t have a care to learn how to update a blog.</description>
