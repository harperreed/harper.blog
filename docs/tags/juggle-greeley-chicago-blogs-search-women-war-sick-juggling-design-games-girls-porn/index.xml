      <description>I have a strange hobby where I look at people peronal home pages. I really enjoy reading peoples blogs and learning all sorts of interesting things about them. heh. it is a strange voyeuristic hobby I guess, however it passes the time. I used to look primarily at slashdot comments. But lately I have been playing on moc, I recently searched for people in my home town of greeley and I found an interesting phenomona: if you search chicago you don&amp;rsquo;t come across many women that are really big into the web cam/subtle porn culture, whereas if you do the same search for greeley 2&amp;frasl;3 of the people are webcam girls.</description>
