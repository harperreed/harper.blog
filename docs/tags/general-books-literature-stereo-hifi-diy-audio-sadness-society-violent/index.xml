      <description>So i have been reading these short, sad, very violent books about society. It is pretty rough.
the first i read was A Personal Matter by Kenzoburo Oe which was about this lostish young man whose wife gives birth to a baby with a severe birth defect. The book is about his struggle to understand his life and the violence within it. it is very dark. reminded me a lot of the Rabbit books, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t as thorough.</description>
