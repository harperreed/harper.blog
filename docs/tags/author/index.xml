      <description>Last night I went to funk night at danny&amp;rsquo;s.. however I forgot that I really don&amp;rsquo;t like funk. heh. suxor. It was still really fun to hang out with friends and see and talk to ladawn., but I wish that I was listening or dancing to hip-hop. I guess I gotta find a hip-hop night so I can invite my friends over to that. heh. I guess I could have it at my house ;).</description>
