      <description>heh. so I stayed up real late tonight looking at web cam girl pages. what a weird world that is. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand it. Such a voyeuristic world we have here. poor weird cat. Sometimes the internet is not amusing. It took me far too long to realize that site was ran by racists.. for a real blow to rationality check out the whitepower kids site or maybe the whitepower womens site.</description>
