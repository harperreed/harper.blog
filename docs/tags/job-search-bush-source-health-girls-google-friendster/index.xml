      <description>George Bush is an awesome president. America has lost 3.3 million jobs since Bush took office. In August, more than 93,000 jobs disappeared. 41 million Americans have no health insurance. (4 out of 5 of them are in working families.) This is the 29th month of the Bush recession. Right now, there are more than 9 million Americans who are looking for work. Bush has the worst jobs record of any president since Herbert Hoover during the Great Depression.</description>
