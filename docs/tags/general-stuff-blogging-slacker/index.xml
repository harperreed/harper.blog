      <description>So I haven&amp;rsquo;t been updating as much as I should. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know why. I have a LOT to blog about. In the past month - I have met some really cool people, attempted to learn python better, got and hacked a bunch with an OLPC. visited and gave a interesting tech talk to Google, hosted a CHIPY meeting and went to the mysql conf in Santa Clara. These are all things that deserve at least one entry if not more than one.</description>
