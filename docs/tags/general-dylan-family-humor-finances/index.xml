      <description>My brother and his wife are struck with a season of hard times. Its a bummer. He is a wonderfully happy person and I know they will get through this fine, but it seems that he is at that point&amp;nbsp;I think almost all of us have been at, where it seems like there is no end near. Where it seems like nobody is helping. And since its financial - it is hard to find help without sacrificing something yourself.</description>
