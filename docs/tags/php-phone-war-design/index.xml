      <description>i was able to fix my photolog in like 3 minutes. it worked out FINE. hah. the pictures from the phone are 640x480 so quite a bit bigger than the previous demensions. however. I think the next step will be hooking GD into the photolog software to create thumbnails. heh. I think it will be worth it. and it will rule. RULE I say. i am able to bypass MMS and use the email client on the phone to send the images.</description>
