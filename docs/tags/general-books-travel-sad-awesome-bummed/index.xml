      <description>So i mistakenly packed this swiss army knife that my brother got for me when he went to switzerland years ago in my carry on luggage. I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to and i had forgotten it was there - cuz i brought it in case i needed it on our road trip. So the airline people took it. Stuff like this always makes me sad. stupid airlines. stupid US being in a fear state.</description>
