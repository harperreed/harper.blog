      <description>here is a video of danzig getting knocked out. hah. so I see this girl on the train all the time. she is really cute. I would like to talk to her. but no. I am a wuss. haha. and train people are scary. I sometimes want to establish myself as crazy. but it is tough on the train. hah. soo much to work with. I will abandon the crazy idea and make an attempt to communicate.</description>
