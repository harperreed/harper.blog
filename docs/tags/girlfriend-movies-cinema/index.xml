      <description>So today my parents came to visit me. How nice it is to finally have something to do. My girlfriend is away again - off to see her parents. Alas, I wish I could be with her. Today we walked around, at at shoddy resturants and went and saw one of the best movies of all time. Lord Of The Rings. Boy oh Boy was it ever entertaining. It was very long, but I was able to handle it - in fact everyone was able to handle it.</description>
