      <description>so my l33t skills didn&amp;rsquo;t work out today. I totally screwed up my servers. well not really. I am not on my new servers yet. I had to leave my old server in colo - which costs me a lot more money, and I had to use the switch- so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to return it. it sucks. I am pretty pissed/upset. mostly cuz I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to pull it off.</description>

      <description>I have been workign nigths for WB doing load testing and such - and it is so weird being up from 10-4 or so and then sleeping as much as you can from 4-10 haha. it is hard on me. I get tired real easy and I totally don&amp;rsquo;t have the stamina to run around and be merry today. Luckily last night was one of the last ones for awhile. work is going well.</description>

      <description>So friday night was the fischerspooner show. it was really quite something. I enjoyed the calculated mistakes and insanity that made up the show. The guys seemed really great as well. Very funny. I loved the break away clothing. and all my friend were their. Here are pictures from the &amp;ldquo;afterparty.&amp;rdquo; never mind my crotch.. it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my fault..Right now I am sitting outside in the sun.. working on my new server.</description>

      <description>So i sent off my server today. It was wierd just packing it in a box and sending it to someone whom i have never met or really talked to a lot. The place that is cohostin git seems kinda sketchy, but at the same time also seems really cool. They are a backbone provider for Ohio State, and the State of Ohio :)&amp;hellip; so the bandwidth will be good - and i will be hooked pretty much directly on the backbone.</description>
