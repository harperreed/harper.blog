      <description>I will be in Colorado tomorrow for Tech Cocktail Boulder. It will be awesome to be a part of this event in Boulder. I will be officially representing skinnyCorp - so come get some swag and hang out! For those that have never been to a Tech Cocktail, it is a meet up style event mixing &#34;cocktails&#34; and technology. It offers a great opportunity to meet some of your local technologist, entrepreneurs and other awesome people in the boulder community.</description>
