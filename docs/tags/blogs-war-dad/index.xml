      <description>tonight I am going to see cursive. it should be fun. I really like that band. but what I like more is this. It is very funny. ;) ;)So we are at war. but at what cost? I imagine it will cost a lot of people their lives. Check out this blog from baghdad. i just don&amp;rsquo;t have much to say at this point. I need to do work. I need to not worry.</description>
