      <description>In the last year or so Threadless has grown insanely. When I started in 2005, we had around 2 servers and a bundle of downtime. Now, just a year and a half later we have an assload of servers and haven&amp;rsquo;t had any load based downtime in almost 6 months. Its awesome. We have really been striving to keep our server infrastructure two steps ahead of our traffic. It really makes a difference when we get slammed and our servers don&amp;rsquo;t even grown.</description>
