      <description>today I went to a fancy shoe sale and bought me fancy boots. here is there web page.. I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay that much ;) it was a sale. it ruled. so so much. I have been playing with itunes.. it is pretty rocking. I am gunna have to figure out how to RULE the aac files. stripping out the ownership bit and what not. so then I can transfer the files to work to listen to.</description>
