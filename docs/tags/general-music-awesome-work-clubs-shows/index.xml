      <description>i remembered that mark verbos was playing his live set at smartbar (and by remember i mean greg told me). It was amazing. Verbos is quite something. i love distortion and hearing it build and seeing him do his little knob thing. haha. so good. i took some pictures. He has posted an MP3 of what he basically did tonight (albeit tonight was quite a bit harder). you should check it out.</description>
