      <description>I sit on IRC quite a lot. Most of the time in #corporate on efnet. I have been there pretty much everyday for the last 5 years. Kind of insane. I love shells. anyway, in the past couple months some friends and i were talking about starting another channel. So we brainstormed some channel names. Then i squatted in a couple of them to see what kind of people came in.</description>
