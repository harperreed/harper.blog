      <description>Today, as I was walking to work. I glanced over and noticed that castro was standing impatiently next to me. He qwas jonesin to cross the street. He was wearing a workers uniform. Always the joker I guess :). As he skipped across the street.. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of the bay of pigs.. if only kennedy could see him now.. or kruschev for that matter.Soon I get my DSS stuff.</description>
