      <description>Awhile ago i decided to switch to Linux on my laptop. It was awesome. I didn&amp;rsquo;t last however - a work emergency occurred and I spent more time getting the openvpn to work up and then getting the Cisco vpn to our servers going than solving the emergency problem. It was indicative that i should have eased into desktop Linux a bit more.
So I have with much sadness reinstalled windows on my primary laptop.</description>
