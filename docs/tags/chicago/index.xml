      <description>Today I am back at work after a four day holiday. It was great. I hung out with my grandfather and my cousin and did all of the tourist stuff that chicago has to offer.. It was a lot of fun. Tonight I am apparentlyl having a small bday party with some friends.. it should be fun. I hope people come. but whatever.. ;) Being back at work is nice. I like to work.</description>
