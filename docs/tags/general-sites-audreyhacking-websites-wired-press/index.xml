      <description>Well&amp;hellip; not me per se - but one of my websites. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know which one, but judgeing from what i have heard - i think they talked about my flickr myspace badge. This is the second time i have heard about being in wired. The first was for audreyhacking.com and i don&amp;rsquo;t think i even saw that one for real. Only for fake. Wow. So if anyone has a scan of the mention - email it to me.</description>
