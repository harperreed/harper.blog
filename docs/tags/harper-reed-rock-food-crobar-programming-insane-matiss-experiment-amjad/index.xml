      <description>hehe. this weekend was an incredible experiment in what I can take - mostly in regards to sleep deprevation - but also in regards to alcohol poisoning. which is really something I am not exactly proud of - but it was a lot of fun. so it all started on thrusday. me and some friends went to a smartbar party - and then to crobar. I had to try out my new &amp;ldquo;drop my name and you can get into crobar for free&amp;rdquo; trick (seriously - on thursdays just say your there to see harper reed - it should work).</description>
