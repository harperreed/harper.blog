      <description>so I came to work. it was nice to go outside. I guess moving is good. although it was tough leaving the comfort (and depression) of my room - it is worth it to be out of the realm of my wallowing. i listened to the butthole surfers on the way to work. hairway to steven. such a great album. hah. and then the cars. how did the cars do that.</description>

      <description>sixtysevenprimi (2:00:50 PM): woah&amp;hellip;that wreck you saw the other day&amp;hellip;that was horrible..it was a bike messenger that works for On Time, he didnt have any brakes on his track bike and ran into a woman I love my bike messenger friends - but I find that often the bike messenging kids are wreckless. They can be just as bad as cars&amp;hellip; which I had is rather ironic.</description>
