      <description>I think it is interesting that i can make a purchase and then use the restroom in a restaurant - but i wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to before i made the purchase. Like going to starbucks and buying a coffee so i can use the bathroom. the 3 dollars means i could use drugs, kill children or whatever they are trying to stop by making the bathrooms for customers only.
I see this sort of transaction a lot.</description>
