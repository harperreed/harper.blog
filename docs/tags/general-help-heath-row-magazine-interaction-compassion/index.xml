      <description>Heath has a nice little exercise written up on his blog about marking up a magazine that you love with a sharpie and sending the resulting notes to the editor for their consideration. It is interesting because the idea is to interact with people who normally are in a one way world. The editors are creating something and rarely would receive comprehensive feedback such as the proposed writeup would create. Heath mentions that the writeup should be short and sweet, with three to five primary points.</description>
