      <description>I just finished watching Donnie Darko. It was quite the movie. I enjoyed it. I thought it was humorous that on halloween - they were showing the last temptation of christ - a movie that isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily halloweenish. It is also funny how similar donnie darko was to this movie. Heh. I smiledwhen they showed clips of evil dead. I really enjoyed the movie. I liked the music and how the sound interacted with the plot.</description>
