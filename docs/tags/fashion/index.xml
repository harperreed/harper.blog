      <description>for news goto: Rense.com - kinda sketchy but interesting and fun filled. also a tad bit anti-israel/semitic(kind sketchy). Drudge Report - a very simple and effective website. Sometimes it is nonsense.. or stupid poli-fashion shit. but its usually worth the visit. RATM current event page - this is a pretty good collection of links, that is seemingly updated daily. It is sanctioned by RATM which is funny. Indymedia - a democratic media outlet.</description>

      <description>This weekend was actually quite good. Friday I hung out with my best friedn in the whole world.. and we had an incredible time. It is a little wierd soemtimes.. because we don&amp;rsquo;t quite know how to interact without dating. I mean - we know how to interact. it is just easier to go back to our old ways. We have to fight that. heh. but we are pulling thorugh. heh.</description>
