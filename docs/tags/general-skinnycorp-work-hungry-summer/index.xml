      <description>i am about to start my new job. Like i need to write down the address and arrive - and magically i will be employed. You can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how excited i am. being unemployed has been rough on my life. i like not doing stuff. but i miss having excess brain time to do hacks and other crap.
this summer has been interesting. i think i am at a point where i can talk about it.</description>
