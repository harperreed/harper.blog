      <description>today I went downtown and picked up voltage converter and some clothes. everyone has been telling me to go and get light colored clothing so that I don&amp;rsquo;t A) burn up and B) get attacked by bugs. apparently there are a lot of bugs. I am not a fan of disease so I guess I will head their suggestions. stupid disease. so I got some clothes. mostly brown pants and nice blue and white shirts.</description>
