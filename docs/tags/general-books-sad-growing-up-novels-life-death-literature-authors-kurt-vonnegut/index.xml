      <description>Yesterday Kurt Vonnegut, one of my favorite authors and a pillar my my upbringing, died. He was 84. I read my first Kurt Vonnegut book, Slapstick, &amp;nbsp;when I was in 5th grade. It was really amazing. I was quite a bit young for the book, but it was a great follow up to Catch-22. hah. I still remember Slapstick and think about it quite often. ~ hi ho ~ I think that is my Favorite Kurt Vonnegut book.</description>
