&lt;p&gt;I got my OGO in the mail today and have been using it on and off all day. It is a pretty cool device. Unfortunantly (as any new device) it has some pretty annoying bits to it. I will give a basic rundown of the features as i see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OGO is basically a device meant to hit the market of “kids” who are texting, instant messaging and emailing a lot. the point between a two way and a sidekick. the back of the box says “This is Ogo. It does IM, it does e-mail, it does text. All in one. All at once. Any time, any place - in your hand, on the bus, at the beach, at home, at large. You don’t need a computer, you don’t need a wire. You get the message. Send word. And welcome to the Ogosphere.” omg. so that is the gest  of it. hah.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
