      <description>So i am kinda tired. i have been sick for the last month. it is lame. First i thought it was just jetlag mixed with matiss&amp;rsquo;s germs from his sickness mixed with being in tokyo and then the US so fast. But then it never really ended - so i decided that i probably have/had a sinus infection and wouldjust have to fight it. So i went to the doctor. He was like &amp;ldquo;yea.</description>
