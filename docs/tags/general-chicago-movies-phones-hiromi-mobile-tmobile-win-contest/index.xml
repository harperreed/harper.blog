      <description>So hiromi got here monday. it has been really fun.
On monday I picked her up and we hung out around my house. Went to our friend becca&amp;rsquo;s house and hung out.Â It was fun. After that we went home - picked up chris - went to irazu and then went to the empty bottle to see becca&amp;rsquo;s husband&amp;rsquo;s band &amp;ldquo;just a fire.&amp;rdquo; It was good - but hiromi about died from jet lag.</description>
