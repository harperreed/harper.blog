      <description>So last night i went with scott to see Billy Corgan&amp;rsquo;s new show. My friend brian is playing keyboards in it so it was nice to see. The stage is amazing and i like billy&amp;rsquo;s new stuff. it was weird cuz i haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a concert in a very long time. so being at this one was like being at a concert in my living room. it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem real.</description>
