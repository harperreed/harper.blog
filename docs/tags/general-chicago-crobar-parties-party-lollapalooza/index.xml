      <description>I am very tired today.
The last 3 days have been full of crazy parties and fun people.Â On thursday was the kill hannah party at crobar. It ruled. Then on friday was Dark Wave Disco - with lady SOV and Tommie Sunshine. After that was the party with the motherfucker peeps and the virgin tears. Then of course.. the afterpary. it was pretty much the same thing as before. haha.</description>
