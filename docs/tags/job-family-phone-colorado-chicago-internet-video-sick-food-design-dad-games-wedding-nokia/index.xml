      <description>this weekend I went to colorado to see my friend sarah get married. it was pretty fun. I really enjoy weddings even though they are so weird. sara h and matt were really cute. it was nice that they got married.
it was a great time. I enjoyed seeing my family and the mountains. jon and I got to hang out with some really funny little kids and got to meet others.</description>
