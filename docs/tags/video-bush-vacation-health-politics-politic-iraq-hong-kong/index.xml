      <description>So I am now at work. Vacations are nice. some would say vacations are kick ass. I woudl tend to agree. The last couple days have been a DVD binge. I purchased 19 dvds from my brothers hollywood video store and got 11 from hong kong. I am excited. Soon I will have to make a dvd database so you can all peruse my dvd collection. I also plan on buying a new tv soon.</description>
