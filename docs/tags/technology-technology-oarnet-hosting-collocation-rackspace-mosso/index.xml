      <description>I hate web hosting. I really do. I think that hosting is one of the most annoying parts of having web apps. It is hard to do. it is hard to manage. It is always more expensive that it needs to be. And it is constantly breaking in ways that severely damage whatever app is hosted on it. However, I have been lucky.
Since 2001, I have had boxes hosted in a collocation environment at OSU.</description>
