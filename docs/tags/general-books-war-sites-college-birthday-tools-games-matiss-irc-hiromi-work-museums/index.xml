      <description>i got up late today. it was a bummer. I did na mean to. but I kept having WEIRD dreams about doing menial tasks at work. so nerve wrecking. they were stressful dreams. not as awesome as other dreams. and my eyes are sleepy. and I am hungry. and and and
last night we went to the science and industry museum - it was closed. suxor. hah.&amp;nbsp; so I think I am going to go tomorrow with hiromi instead.</description>
