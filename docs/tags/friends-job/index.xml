      <description>Damn. I am scared. I need a job. Like really bad. Check out www.nata2.org to see how bad. Well on a lighter note, things with K*star are going incredible. I have never felt the things i feel with her. It is wonderful. Oh, it is hard to run a company. I hate it. I don&amp;rsquo;t like charging people, and when they don&amp;rsquo;t pay i feel bad. hehe. But whatever. Hopefully, next time i talk here i will have a job :)</description>
