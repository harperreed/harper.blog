      <description>i just realized that I have stood up on my feet for way too long. I am going to take it easy tonight.. which is strange considering that I have gone out a lot lately. You never know however&amp;hellip; what happens later.. heh.. I may go out. chicago is wierd like that. I may also sit in my room.. drink soda and eat food.. which is amazingly appealing. oh.. and write web applications of course.</description>
