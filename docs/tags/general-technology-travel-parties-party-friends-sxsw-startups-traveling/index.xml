      <description>I am finally recovered from my flash travel/party tour. Being shuttled around the country going to parties is a rough life - let me tell you. It was awesome. I met some great people and saw some really cool stuff. It was really cool how much overlap occurred between the boulder crowd and SXSW.
Startup people are fun.
I want to run down the events and how they turned out. The first was boulder.</description>
