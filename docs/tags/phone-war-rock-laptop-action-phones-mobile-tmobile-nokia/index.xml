      <description>this is an incredible headline. maybe the best fark headline I have ever seen. today I stumbled accross banksy&amp;rsquo;s site. his stencil work is out of control. it was really busy this mornign so i mirrored it. I also ordered some of his work. nice work. that is. i am feeling very weird. my conversation with morgan last night gave me some much needed hope. but it also stirred all my emotions up into a mess of colors.</description>
