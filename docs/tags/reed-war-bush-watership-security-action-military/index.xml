      <description>Please check out http://www.watership.org, http://indymedia.org/ and http://slashdot.org for more information on the terrorist attack on the U.S. This is not good. Very much a bad situation.
Look at what we have so far:
 &amp;ldquo;We (members of the german army) have been put on alert, people are being revoked from holiday, all system/material checked, no talk policy. &amp;rdquo; (sid=21542&amp;amp;cid=2277927)
&amp;ldquo;The US military is on alert. For security reasons I can&amp;rsquo;t post more details, but the 82nd airborne division has been told to suit up and according to one report one unit is already in the air, though they&amp;rsquo;re not sure where they&amp;rsquo;ll be landing yet.</description>
