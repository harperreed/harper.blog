      <description>so my accupunture last night was cool. it strangely seemed to effect my mood - which I was not quite ready for. I was totally a irrational, tired and emotional mess. haha. but I knew it while it was happening - so I just acted weird a couple times and was mostly quiet. I wonder if it was the actual accupunture that put me into a funk or if it was just the fact that I was tired and the pushing myself to be stronger , faster, and better.</description>

The first is one my friend mike showed me. actually, now that I think of it - he should me this one as well. My friend adam show me this one. it isn&amp;rsquo;t as techically good as the others, but is still funny.</description>
