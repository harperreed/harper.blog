      <description>This weekend my parents visited. It was really awesome. They haven&amp;rsquo;t visited since Hiromi moved back - and they really wanted to see her. So they stopped by for a quick trip and some excellent dining.
They got in Thursday night - so Hiromi and myself went downtown and visited them at the Hard Rock Hotel and had a nice quick drink. They stayed on the same floor (the Frank Zappa floor) and the exact same room as Hiromi and I - when we last stayed in the Hard Rock.</description>
