      <description>Check out me.. build one for yourself&amp;hellip; I found some chicago based design kids. It is neat to see the internet that I know and love suddenly appear in a physical form around me&amp;hellip; For design-geek events check out Anonymous Federated. It seems to be cool.. but has no events posted at this moment. Here is a good indie rock music review site&amp;hellip; that is ran by this guy maybe.. I guess the test is whether it will hold up to pitch fork.</description>
