      <description>So yesterday was nuts. I got up made sure I was packed for nyc and went to work. at work - I was whisked away on a cruise around lake michigan for employee appreciation day. We got free food - expensive drinks and generally had a nice time. I got to meet some of the new young people. I think we are going to start a young person club. it will be pretty dope I think&amp;hellip; then at 2:00 or so we left.</description>
