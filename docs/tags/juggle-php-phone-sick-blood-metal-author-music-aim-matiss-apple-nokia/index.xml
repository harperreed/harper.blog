      <description>so the past month - I have reengaged my ears in a black metal journey. it is awesome. I so I found a REALLY REALLY good document about taking apart and iMac. now I just have to find the power supply part. hehe. check out this site for a similar doc. yesterday beck&amp;rsquo;s friend tamour hooked up with us and we juggled. it was pretty fun. then we hung out. matiss and I played quake - while listening to black metal of course - and then tamour called and we got dinner.</description>
