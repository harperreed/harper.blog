      <description>today was hard. I was able to hold up. Work was ok. I am trying to decide a hobby. maybe direct TV hacking.. maybe console stuff.. maybe getting a no region dvd. . I am thinking about drowning my sorrows in technology(something I do really good) and buying a laptop. hmm.. but I need one with UXGA(ahhh 1600x1200), however that shit is expensive.. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay $2500 for a freaking computer(ha ha)  anyway.</description>
