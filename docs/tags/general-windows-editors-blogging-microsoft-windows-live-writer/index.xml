      <description>I love Windows Live Writer. It makes blogging really easy. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about spelling, forming my links or the technical aspects of creating an entry. All I have to do is type in this app. and BAM. it works wonders. Anyway, they released a new version of Windows Live Writer. It has all sorts of neat new features (real time spell checking!!) and is pretty snappy. Check out&amp;nbsp; the release at the Windows Live writer page.</description>
