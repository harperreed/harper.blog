      <description>stupid media so gorbachev has called Bush&amp;rsquo;s decision to invade Iraq a mistake. wow, that is a surprise. I wonder why it matters when gorbachev says it.. but doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter when the citizens of the US say it. one thing that really pisses me off is that bush is all hot and bothered about national health care for IRAQ and the US is in them midst of a health care crisis and bush is rejecting any possible solution.</description>
