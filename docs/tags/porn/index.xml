      <description>soemthing happened that made me think.. &amp;ldquo;blog this!&amp;rdquo; but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what it was. bummer. maybe I will remember. i got the tivo working. it is pretty fun. I have yet to get the wireless inet working for it. stupid /dev/wlan isn&amp;rsquo;t there. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why. the driver just doesn&amp;rsquo;t do it. damned USB. I thought about going and buying a shittier one today at compusa. maybe I will do that during lunch.</description>
