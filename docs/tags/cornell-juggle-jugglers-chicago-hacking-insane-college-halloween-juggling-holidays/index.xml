      <description>This weekend was insane. as you may be able to tell from the crazy blog entries. I was a madperson. So.. on saturday I went to quad cities juggle fest. it was a lot of fun. I hung out with mark and some nice jugglers from carleton college. we juggled a bunch. I love juggling with little kids - who are as good as I am. hah. at five or so I went to the theatre with mark.</description>
