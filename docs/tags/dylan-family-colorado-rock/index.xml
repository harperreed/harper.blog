      <description>so I just got back from colorado. it was nice to see my family and such. here are pictures and such. check out my cousins(cole, kile and kory). on saturday night.. mike, sherwin, dylan and myself went to dylans work and played with the crazy game machines.. sherwin won billions of tickets.. ehehhe.. so we traded them in for dracula teeth and piggy banks. it ruled. we were then bored enough to go and buy estes rocket engines and light them off without rockets attached.</description>
