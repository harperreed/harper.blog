      <description>oh yea. i am here. well not really nyc. somewhere near i guess. got in this morning around 9:00am after leaving my house at 4:00 (that sucked for sure). Then i slept very uncomfortably on the unsleepable chairs at the airport. slept around 4 hours. and then went downstairs and yoyoed for 4 hours.
After my yoyo extravaganza we met up and went to thai food. I love thai food. this place was great.</description>
