      <description>So my foot really really hurts. i have NO idea what i did. seriously. none. no memory of banging it on something, or hitting it, or crushing it or anything. i just woke up on monday and it really hurt. On monday i could walk a bit. then by monday night - i could barely walk on it. so i took a warm bath, no help; i put it on ice, nothing; i slept, that helped (heh) but when i woke up today it was killing me again.</description>
