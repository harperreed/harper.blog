      <description>Today i picked up our wedding rings. So now we are officially married in other peoples eyes. hehe. Its pretty neat - but wearing a ring will take some getting use to. It is currently interfering with my typing - but I think that is my perception and not reality. I imagine I will soon get used to it and will forget that i ever thought it was weird. heh.
