      <description>I got tired of the old theme, so I sat down tonight and modified the heck out of the blogging pro theme to make it more my own. I like how it turned out. I think that there are still a few hacks and tweaks I will have to incorporate - but I like the feel. I still need to figure out if I want to add ads. I probably should, since my blog is growing a bit, but I just hate having ads&amp;nbsp; - so maybe I will concentrate on making my other sites make money.</description>
