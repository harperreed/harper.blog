      <description>Tonight, Scott and I presented at the Chicago Ignite tech meetup. It was pretty fun. The event was &amp;ldquo;eventful&amp;rdquo; and the people were the usual. I was able to meet up with trow and the hosted labs guys - so that was good. It is always fun to involve ourselves in these affinity events. This one was especially funny because it was at a good friends bar. So when we showed up - it was quite hilarious.</description>
