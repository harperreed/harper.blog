      <description>so I have been reading the rabbit series of books by john updike. they are pretty good. I started with &amp;ldquo;rabbit redux&amp;rdquo; and just finished &amp;ldquo;rabbit, run&amp;rdquo; last night. after I finished &amp;ldquo;rabbit, run&amp;rdquo; I immediately started &amp;ldquo;rabbit is rich.&amp;rdquo; anyway. I have been thinking about rabbit and what I like/dislike about him in these books. well I don&amp;rsquo;t really like him in &amp;ldquo;rabbit, run&amp;rdquo; - I think he is obviously the anti-hero, a destroyer; however I do like him in &amp;ldquo;rabbit redux.</description>
