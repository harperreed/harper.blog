      <description>So work got hard again. everyone is super stressed and really getting down about this project. I am confident it will be resolved soon enough. we just have to do it ;)in the meantime, we shoudl all be playing NES and then download GTA and go killin.  this is incredibly strange. I really don&amp;rsquo;t understand what it is. happy sabrina?? this isn&amp;rsquo;t as weird.. but is very strange. good thing I use the e2cs.</description>
