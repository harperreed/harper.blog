      <description>I am not a normal person (hahah). When I use my computer, I want to be around people. If Hiromi is in the living room, I want to hang out with her while I code or do whatever. But that often means sitting on the couch with my laptop. We have a pretty nice couch - nothing too fancy, but it is comfortable and good for sitting. But it makes you slouch.</description>
