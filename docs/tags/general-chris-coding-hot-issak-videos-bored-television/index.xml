      <description>so i sit in front of my TV and listen to music or watch old movies while i code. It is probably killer on my back and such - but it makes coding a lot less lonely and i get a lot done. But tonight it was really bad. My airport express was being a bitch and their was shit on tv - so i ended up watching VH1. MAN. i love crappy music.</description>
