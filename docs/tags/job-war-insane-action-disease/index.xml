      <description>So, I had another weird dream. this one was quite scary - not that weird good scary either. Real real scary. Not fun. it went like this:  I was one of the head guys at a mental institution and I was in charge of combating all communicable diseases. So I got an alert of a breakout of this scary disease that turns ordinary people into shape shifters on a killing rampage.</description>
