      <description>man. I had a rough weekend. I am so so tired. t I r e d . . this entry will be composed of me complaining.. just letting you know ;). I have been sick since tuesday. and I can&amp;rsquo;t get better. for some reason - it sucks. I think I lead a unhealthy lifestyle.. mostly in terms of eating. but smoking crack so much certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t help. So yesterday miriam left for cologne.</description>
