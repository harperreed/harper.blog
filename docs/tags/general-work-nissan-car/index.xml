      <description>So Hiromi and I got a new car. A Nissan Versa. It is not a big car. It is tiny and has good safety ratings. Hiromi is currently driving it back from colorado. I am excited to see it. I am not sure but it may feature a continuously variable transmission. Which would be really neat. Regardless - it will not be a gas guzzler and will be small enough to park on city streets.</description>
