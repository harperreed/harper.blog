      <description>Yes. it is true. i am freakishly busy. and of course while being freakishly busy i find the most time expensive hobby ever. So matiss and i have been playing quake 3 again. We were playing the requiem mod for hours, but it got kinda boring so we switched to the urban terror full conversion. It rules.
I am totally not a game player, but i am suddenly VERY interested in playing counterstrike and solcom.</description>
