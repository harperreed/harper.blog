      <description>So I finally made a decision and paid off most of my credit cards and small business loans. it is fuckin stupid. I hate not havign money. and now I am poor. goddamn it. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t swear in my blog. but I feel that this is a good time to do it. however.. I feel better - cuz now I can finally get a handle on my finances. I mean it was cool having a bunch of money in savings.</description>
