      <description>So i am going to tokyo on thursday to visit hiromi. I am really excited and quite happy. hiromi and i have been dating for quite awhile and will be getting married on the 29th of august in Yamanashi. I am quite excited. I have kept this quiet - because well&amp;hellip; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally official for awhile.. we haven&amp;rsquo;t actually been around each other to officiate things and well i didn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about it too much before things go to the point were it was almost real.</description>
