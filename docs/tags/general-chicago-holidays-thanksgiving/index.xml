      <description>Happy thanksgiving!
It has been a long and lazy day today. Pretty awesome. We are about to head out to a party at our friend Jill&amp;rsquo;s house. it should be fun. There were so many options this year. Quite a few people offered to include us in their families thanksgiving - it was a hard decision. I just picked the first one. haha. (and hopefully the one with the best food - as the hosts are all chefs at various places around the city).</description>
