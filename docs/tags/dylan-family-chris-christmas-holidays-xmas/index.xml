      <description>So we had a great xmas. I am glad to be back but I was really happy to be able to spend christmas with my family. my cat had a hole in it. it was gross. but apparently it is getting filled in or has gotten filled in. it was really nasty. we all hung out and dressed up. my father wore his bling and I wore my fur - dylan was dressed normal.</description>
