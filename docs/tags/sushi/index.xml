      <description>apparently I need to practice before starting going out again. after a two week sabatical I went out again this weekend. it was fun - but I totally drank too much. so today I feel a little bit under the weather. stupid weather. my friend mike is in town and we have been hanging out. on friday night we went to eat at reza&amp;rsquo;s and then an art opening andthen a party.</description>
