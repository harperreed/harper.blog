      <description>so it rained really hard for a long tie tonight. well not too long but like 30 minutes. the hippie guy that lives next door told me that a tornado was spotted 30 miles away. whoa. that would be crazy. in the country tornados touch down and nothing happens. but here havoc wuold insue. whoa. so after he said this - I immediately took off all my clothes and put on my nike basketball shorts and went outside and laid on my lawn chair.</description>
