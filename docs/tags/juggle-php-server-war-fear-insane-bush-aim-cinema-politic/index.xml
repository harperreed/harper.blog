      <description>I juggled at six flags again this weekend. My hands turn so so black it is unnatural. they just change to a different shade altogether.. no matter how much you wash them. so troublesome. Anyway.. yesterday I worked a bunch and played with my mind not understanding time changes.. so funny. I am still pretty bummed about wellstone. That was a true loss (versus all those other people who died :P).</description>
