      <description>After a really nice long week in Colorado I am sadly back in Chicago and back to work. We had a fun time. I got in two Fridays ago.
I arrived in Colorado the Friday before thanksgiving. My plane was arriving late - so my brother and his wife Sarah picked me up. We then drove to Burlington to meet up with my parents and relatives at my grandfathers house. We got to Burlington late so I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get a chance to hang out much - but I did get a chance to see my parents new dog ellie.</description>
