      <description>I really hate TicketMaster. Seriously. They are scamming people left and right. It is insane how much tickets are. Today - hiromi and I decided to go see Jon Stewart at the Rosemont Arena.&amp;nbsp;I jumped online and found that they were selling tickets at TicketMaster. I immediately was scared of how much they were going to be, but we really wanted to go. So I went through the process of ordering them.</description>
