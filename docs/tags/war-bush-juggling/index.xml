      <description>USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA I sit in my kitchen once again.. having just got back from a juggling show at the Prodigal Son. It was a great time. It was incredible. The audience was receptive.. the juggling went well. We didn&amp;rsquo;t drop at any pivitol points.. heh. and we got contacts for more gigs. I am very interested in what is going to happen in the marrow.</description>
