      <description>anyway.. so the movie &amp;ldquo;Lost in Translation&amp;rdquo; is good. I know. I saw it. it is nice. I enjoy Sofia Coppola&amp;rsquo;s movies. even though they are rather airy - it is an airy I appreciate. Bill Murrey was great.</description>

      <description>I just watched 8 mile. it is good. a little over acting a little underacting. but eminem is not an actor so it is a rather good movie.. I enjoyed it. he does have quite a bit of anger. a lot of anger.. over simple things.. it is sad..tonight I think we are going to watch a bunch of movies. it will be fun. the window is open in my room and in my living room.</description>
