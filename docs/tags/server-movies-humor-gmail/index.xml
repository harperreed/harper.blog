      <description>so today over lunch I decided it would be a good idea to import my old email into gmail. it rules. check out the tool that I am using. written by mark lyon. it works pretty well - albeit very slow. but whatever. I will just have it go in the background. my server has a lot of bandwidth. seriously. this  is pretty bad. i have listened to twisted sister&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;burn in hell&amp;rdquo; a billion times today and it isn&amp;rsquo;t getting very old.</description>
