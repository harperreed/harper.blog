      <description>So ihad this very strange dream. I dremt that lamprey like fish had started to colonize humans. They would come and dig themselves down your throat and when you breathed they would just pass the air through them and you &amp;ldquo;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; notice. I mean you would notice but you were still able to breathe &amp;ldquo;normally.&amp;rdquo; Well anyway, the lampreys were attaching themselves to humans and a regiment was created to purge yourself of the lamprey.</description>
