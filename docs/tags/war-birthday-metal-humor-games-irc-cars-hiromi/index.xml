      <description>heh. hah. hoh. Yea. so this weekend was great. it really was. Quite something. On friday, I got up a little late. Not too late. but late enough to feel like a rebel.. and I went to work. I was able to wear jeans.. cuz friday is casual.. hah. so I worked.. and then I got home&amp;hellip; and went to a couple art openings.. The one that was memorable was A curatorial collaboration using the work of Jimmy McBride(heh).</description>
