      <description>The shirt I am wearing to day is far too small. heh. it isn&amp;rsquo;t relaly &amp;ldquo;far&amp;rdquo; too small - just enough wear I feel awkward wearing it. and it is BRIGHT purple. I got it about 6 months ago. and I thought it fit. so I hung it up and then put it on prolly 2 months afte I got it. I then was like &amp;ldquo;wtf, did I grow&amp;rdquo; - cuz it didn&amp;rsquo;t fit at all.</description>

      <description>Last night I worte a little software package that hooks my phone up with ringers and pictures.. heh. nice ;)  And the I went to go see bone thugs and harmony. They were so good. THe crowd was once again.. rather violent. There were a couple rather comprenhensive fights. it was crazy. but bone was real good. I always get so sad when listening to that band. The lives they portray is so negative.</description>
