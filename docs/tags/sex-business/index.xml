      <description>so I left work at 4:40 and I was just walkign across the outside by my work minding my own business when I notice that this dude is having sex wiht some lady like 5 feet away. I look away, mumble &amp;ldquo;my bad&amp;rdquo; and walk a bit faster away. really really really weird. they just stared at me while I walked by. it was very strange. right on the concrete benches outside of my work.</description>
