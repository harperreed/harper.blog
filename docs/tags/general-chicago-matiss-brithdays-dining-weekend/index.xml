      <description>This weekend was a lot of fun. It isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet, but it has been so full of activity and good things that it has ruled. So first off, Hiromi got a job. It is still about 5% tentative, but all she has to do is sign the contract and start. It is for a Japanese game company and I think it will fit hiromi well. She seemed to really like the people she interviewed with and she will get to use her management experience as well as Japanese.</description>
