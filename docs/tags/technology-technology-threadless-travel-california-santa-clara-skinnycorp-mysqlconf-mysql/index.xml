      <description>Ivan and I are in Santa Clara this week for the mysql conference. We are going to learn how to make threadless so fast that it breaks hearts. That is really fast. We got here a bit earlier today and have been waiting for our rooms to become ready. The weather is great - about the same as Chicago and I think it will only get better as we stay here.</description>
