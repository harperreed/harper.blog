      <description>As you probably noticed, i was at work late last night. As usual, My coworker andrew was also here. Often when it is just the two of us - we theorize and talk about everything that is going on like two old stoners in a VW van. Its nuts. We cover everything from office politics to why stars are green. hah. Anyway, last night andrew said a couple of things that made me really think.</description>
