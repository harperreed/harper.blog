      <description>So while friendster is sucking it up.. cacheing everything.. and taking a long time for shit to work.. I did some research. this guy started it.. he has apparently been around for awhile. check out the growth. it is obvious that they did not prepare for this amount of traffic. on another note.. did anyone notice that amazon.com is slowly purchasing everything. weird.my mouth tastes funny.. stupid antifreeze.. so sweet.. yet such a bad aftertaste</description>
