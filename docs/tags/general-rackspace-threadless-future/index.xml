      <description>I am leaving Threadless after 4 awesome years.
It was super hard to leave a job that taught me so much, helped me grow and was staffed by all of my friends, but I needed to make that leap towards the future. (Here is a nice interview covering all sorts of aspects of my leaving.)
I did it, and the future is looking bright.
In the next few months, I am going to be helping Rackspace in their cloud computing division.</description>
