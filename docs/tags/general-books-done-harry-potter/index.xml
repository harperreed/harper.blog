      <description>I thoroughly enjoyed the new Harry Potter. I just finished it. barely 24 hours after I bought it from borders(I had originally ordered it from amazon, but it was delayed by skinnyCorp being closed). I was a reading machine.
It was a good ending. Enough complexity to make things interesting. It was good. If you like harry potter - do not hesitate to read the book. Ok. Now I need to check my email and what not.</description>
