      <description>Man this server really wiped me out. However, it was/is quite the resume builder and it saved me around $200/month. RULE. I really can&amp;rsquo;t tell if it is wednesday or thursday. hmm.. I wonder. Today marks the fourteenth month that k*star and I have dated. what a wonderful time. it was sad when we almost broke up&amp;hellip; hopefully not for ahile yet will that happen.. anyway.. I have a big weekend in front of me.</description>
