      <description>I am mad at boston. mostly cuz it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a damn bit of sense. the roads all go this way and that. I was not aware of how drasticly logic chicago&amp;rsquo;s roadway system was until about 45 minutes ago. also wtf is with the trains that make NO sense. serious. No sense at all. and they are really buses.. acting like trains. not trains at all. slackers&amp;hellip;bush is kinda dumbi have no doubt that this &amp;ldquo;state of the union&amp;rdquo; nonesense will only get us into trouble.</description>
