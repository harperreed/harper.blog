      <description>Last night I went out to this club and saw some of the strangest and most entertaining performances of my short stay in lovely chicago. It was a &amp;ldquo;Battle Royal&amp;rdquo; of sorts between two &amp;ldquo;laptronica&amp;rdquo; teams. Each team had a tellytubby to fight out the matchs wrestling-style. The music was bomb and the teams were funny shit. I have never in all my years seen something so amusing. hehI also managed to get some connections with the chicago underground &amp;ldquo;geek&amp;rdquo; scene.</description>
