      <description>I spent most of this weekend helping move our offices from our old place to our new place. Its amazing what a change of ~10k square feet can make. We started on Thursday packing and prepping the new space. Building racks, and generally fixing up the new space for our big moving day. Then on Friday the movers arrived and we all bundled up the shirts and rocked out. I was lucky and had to set up our adhoc (not as in computer to computer - but as in not planned) wifi network.</description>
