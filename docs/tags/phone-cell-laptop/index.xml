      <description>I really need a new computer. I would really like a laptop.. with a UXGA screen. For the last 1.5 weeks I have been using my cell phone as an instant messenger client. It is kinda cumbersome and not exactly convienient. however. it works. ugh So a friend came over tonight.. she is nice. I would like to get to know her better. heh. however.. all her stuff was stolen out of her car whilst she was visiting.</description>
