      <description>today I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.. which is incredibly hard.. since there is a wall in the way.. but however I managed it.. I am totally backwards and screwed up today. it is a pain. first off I locked myself out of my apartment.. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even ready to leave.. but I left.. then realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything but my cell phone.. so I was able to call and wake matiss to have him let me in.</description>
