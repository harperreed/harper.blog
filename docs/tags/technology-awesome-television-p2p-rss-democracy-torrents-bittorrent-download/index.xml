      <description>So I canceled directTV awhile back and have been struggling to figure out how to easily download the shows I want to watch. I would love to do it legally. I have looked into the itunes solution - but they don&amp;rsquo;t have all I need/want. And it won&amp;rsquo;t work for hiromi - in japan. So I needed something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t region specific and something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard.
With these requirements I poked around quite a bit.</description>
