      <description>Today is weird. I worked from 9 to 5 twice in 24 hours. That is a lot of work. I am totally of the school of thought that you should always pace yourself. 16 hours with a 3 hour break isn&amp;rsquo;t really pacing myself. But whatever - it is the same sxhedule I sometimes have with going out and work - and I don&amp;rsquo;t complain then. Heh.
Today I got a letter from my friend ella from taiwan.</description>
