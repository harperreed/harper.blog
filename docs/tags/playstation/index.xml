      <description>As I sit here waiting for scans to finish and my playstation to arrive.. I found some interesting stuff. First off, my new hobby. I don&amp;rsquo;t goto kuro5hin often.. but I am usually happy when I do. and they added a really neat ad system where people contribute ads to the site. the ads rule. they are so funny and some are quite cool. I think they are cheap as well.</description>
