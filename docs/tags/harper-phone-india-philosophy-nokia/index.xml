      <description>i got my tickets to india today. it is pretty funny how every little step makes it more and more real. I imagien I iwll be writing on the plane &amp;ldquo;i am in the air, it now seems real.&amp;rdquo; haha. I leave in 5 days. I can barely believe that 3 weeks ago - I had no idea this was to be happening. this is going to be a good summer.</description>
