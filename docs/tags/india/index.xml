      <description>ftp: 24154010 bytes sent in 1676.59Seconds 14.41Kbytes/sec.not fasthowever I am really dumb and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work. stupid ascii. I guess another 1600 seconds will do me good. anyway. when it is done. the pictures will be here. check them out. realize however that I practice shotgun style photography. for every 100 shots there are 5 good. so there will be about 15 good pictures out of the 300 I have taken.</description>
