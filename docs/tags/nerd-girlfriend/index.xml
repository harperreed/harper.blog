      <description>Today, I was almost hit by a car. I mean real close. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t my fault either. I was just walking in the cross walk and this taxi tried to hit me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t flinch at all. Which in retrospect I think is quite wierd. the car just slammed on its brakes and I kept walking and didn&amp;rsquo;t think anything wierd was going on. heh. whatever.Today is such a wierd day.</description>
