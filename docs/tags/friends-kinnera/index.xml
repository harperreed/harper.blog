      <description>So I saw madonna the other night, and i would like to say that she is very good in concert. I think that she may have put on the best concert i have ever seen(i have seen a few). She had great choreography, and incredible sets and costumes. It was quite spectacular. I would love to go again, and i have been scouring ebay for more tickets. The only problem was, that our tickets weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly &amp;ldquo;great.</description>
