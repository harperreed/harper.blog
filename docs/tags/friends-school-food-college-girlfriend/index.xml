      <description>So K*star left for school today, it was wierd. I want to goto school again. I am through with this grown up crap. I liked college better. I like being around K*star better :) Anyway, why is it that we have to grow up. I hate it. Its dumb..I really miss having food prepared for me, having everything paid for. Having the worst thing be a missed party or something a long those lines.</description>
