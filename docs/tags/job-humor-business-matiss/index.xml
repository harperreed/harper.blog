      <description>i am so sleepy. so here are some links for yall. First I have an interesting article about Russell&amp;rsquo;s Paradox. and then the related article about how SUVs are not really safe. which of course leads us to the horrible U.S. job market. WHen I was a smaller person.. I used to have matiss sign my credit cards. he often would draw little pictures. it was humorous. this is an interesting article about afrodisiacs.</description>
