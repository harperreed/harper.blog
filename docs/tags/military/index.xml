      <description>heh. you have got ot check this out. My favorite is the dance contest. that furry guy can get down.  i wonder if this is nice or funny looking? In other news(;)) it seems that people are fed up with our completly fuxored media. a friedn sent me this link that talks about a news paper that is supposed to tell the truth about our little military conflict. I wonder what history will say about this?</description>
