      <description>So this weekend was awesome. Kile and my mother flew in on thursday and we met up for dinner. They went to cirque du soliel and i went to juggling. Then on friday - i picked up my cousin kile at his hotel and we went to my work. He caused trouble and played xbox. I worked on our new secret project. After work - we went to sushi wabi and then kile went and played in the fountains in millenium park.</description>
