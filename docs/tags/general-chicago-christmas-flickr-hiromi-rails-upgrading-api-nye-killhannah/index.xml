      <description>I am lost in regards to what to listen to. I need something new. Or old. i don&amp;rsquo;t know.
This is really amazing. For some reason people are taking &amp;ldquo;famous&amp;rdquo; videos and making them &amp;ldquo;stable.&amp;rdquo; It is quite interesting and makes watching the videos a bit more mysterious - cuz the video becomes much more clear and&amp;hellip; stable. hah.
Christmas was cool. Hiromi came over from tokyo around the 19th. We hung out with a bunch of people.</description>
