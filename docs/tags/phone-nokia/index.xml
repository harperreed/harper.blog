      <description>so I woke up this morning and the heater was on. it is not a cold day out. it is not hot. but it is nearish 60 or 70. but the heat really made it hot. heh. I was really confused. I woke up and turned my fans on. weird. here is my brothers package I am about to send him. hehe. I am pretty excited. he better be too. or I iwll punch him in the nuts.</description>
