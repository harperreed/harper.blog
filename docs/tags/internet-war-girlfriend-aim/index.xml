      <description>so last night after morgan left I felt pretty good. like. &amp;ldquo;ok this will be fine. I understand. it is all good. I look forward to being her friend.&amp;rdquo; today. I wake up. it is not easier. it is not fun. I really don&amp;rsquo;t want this to be happening. honestly. I am really sad. I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to goto work. I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to hang out. I look to checking my email in case she sent me one.</description>
