      <description>heh. check out my new design. it is almost done. I need to fancy it up a bit and tweak it a little bit. but for the most part it is near completion.  also check out 43 things - a really really cool idea. I think I will integrate it with my new blog design. I also want to make a friends section like nick whatever&amp;rsquo;s blog - which I don&amp;rsquo;t want to find right now.</description>
