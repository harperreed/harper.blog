      <description>while I was at home my dad gave me this weird japanese thing that shocks you. it claims that it is an &amp;ldquo;electronic nerve stimulus&amp;rdquo; and it made by the advance company. so we went and hooked it up to ourselves and shocked the hell out of each other. it was really fun getting three people in a row and setting the unit rather high. it was hilarious. but now I am all skittish ;) hahai got further in zelda.</description>
