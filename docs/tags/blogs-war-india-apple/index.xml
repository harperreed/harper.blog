      <description>the whole thing is so strange. I think I coudl say that right now I am experiencing some of the strangest emotions and experiences I have had in awhile. mostly due to work, india, morgan, friends, general life, real estate, money. yea know. the good stuff. all that stuff just creates such anxiety in my life. it is so so weird. however, as confusing as it is, it isn&amp;rsquo;t bad. in fact a lot of it is good.</description>
