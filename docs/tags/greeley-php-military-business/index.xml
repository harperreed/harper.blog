      <description>i guess conagra, the company behind the beef industry in my home town, recently recalled 18.6 million pounds of ground beef. wtf. it is insanity. I hope no one dies. An interesting article about the beef industry is here. It mentions greeley a couple times - especially in regard to the number of cows it slaughters per hour and how the increase in numbe rof cows.. has increased the likelyhood for beef contamination.</description>
