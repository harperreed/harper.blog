      <description>Hip Hop. Oh yes.. Well, another christmas has gone and went.. and to think i just started acknowledging the year 200 last month.. heh.. its almost 2k1. I think it is funny how time flys. i mean i just started school almost 4 years ago.. when i was like 19.. now as i approach my 23rd birthday, i realize that their isn&amp;rsquo;t really a difference between being 23 and being 45.</description>
