      <description>so we got back from madfest last night rather late. I went to bed and I woke up sick. I hate being sick. Madfest ruled however. I had a really good time. It was and always is quite something. The show on saturday noght was really great. heh. so much fun. ;) - I learned a bunch of new tricks and hung with a bunchf of really cool jugglers. Matiss and I almost won the seven club passing endurance - however the kasemans beat us again.</description>
