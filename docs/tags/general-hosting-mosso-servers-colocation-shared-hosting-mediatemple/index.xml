      <description>For the first time in almost 7 years my servers are offline.
I just shut them down. It was pretty sad. They were good servers. They did a lot of traffic. They were slashdotted, dugg, reddited, and probably any other sited that was hot shit in the last 6 years.Â I installed them when my dedicated host died in early 2001. Originally I just shipped them a box, which they hooked up.</description>
