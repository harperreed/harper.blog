      <description>I am currently working and watching the documentary &amp;ldquo;Control Room.&amp;rdquo; It is really incredible. Quite something. watching the footage of the hostages being interviewed really brought me back to the feelings i had. It is insane to see the backend of Al Jazeera. They are soo smart; they really had their shit together. it is madness. The discussion of reporter objectivity is very important i think. And listening to the media people change their response to aj jazeera.</description>
