      <description>So Hiromi and I are all married up now. Exciting. It was a weird and bureaucracy filled trip these last couple months and it all culminated with an excellent trip to Tokyo with my dad and Hiromi and us getting hitched.
So, apparently, attempting to get a visa to the U.S. is a bunch of work. It really demonstrates how much bureaucracy is involved in government work. When we were all done with our forms and what not, I bet I had one full ream of paper all filled out.</description>
