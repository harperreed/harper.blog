      <description>every couple months I sit hear and invest some money in metal records. today was one such day. I got some slayer, the new fear factory - some emo band called alkaline trio and some pop will eat itself. All of it rules. heh. I especially lik ethe new fear factory. Never was a band so cool. and the slayer of course rules. but you know how tey are. I wish girls would call me.</description>
