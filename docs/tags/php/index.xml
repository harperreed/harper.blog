      <description>work is fun. however for the past 12 hours - my sternum has felt like it needed to be &amp;ldquo;popped.&amp;rdquo; like a back. it sucks. it kinda hurts when I breath. I hope I am not dieing. heh. today I am not a fan of Harry Angstrom. I am annoyed at how hard he is on his son. me and my friends have been playing media mammon maniacally. it rules. basically you pick words to trade on a market - but the market value of each word is detirmined by the density of that word in the news.</description>

      <description>Today I got bored after work and made this. It is an automagic .Klip file maker for use with the serence KlipFolio product. It allows any blog owner to make a .klip file for someone to download, so that they can syndicate their content easy and whatnot. I was tired of only having the canned content that serence provides. now I can use whatever I want.. hehe. I rule. Check out the Automagic .</description>

      <description>This is so true. check out my new page. I am really interested in atom and his package - I used to love hearing about people named adam that referred to themselves as atom. I always wanted my name to be atom smasher or atom bomb.. or whatever. 
this is really interesting if you are a PHP user. Last night annie lennox one. For good reason. she looked just like annie lennox.</description>
