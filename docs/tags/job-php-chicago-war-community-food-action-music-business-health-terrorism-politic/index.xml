      <description>Apparently a protest is going down against the Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD). The TABD offers an effective framework for enhanced cooperation between the transatlantic business community and the governments of the European Union (EU) and United States (US). Or the TABD is a coalition of U.S. and European CEOs, that is mandated by and gets unlimited access to the U.S. and European governments. It helps boost transatlantic trade for large corporations by promoting the WTO and knocking down &amp;ldquo;barriers to trade&amp;rdquo;.</description>
