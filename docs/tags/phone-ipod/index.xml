      <description>So the weekend is over.. well almost. tonight I think we are going to see the matrix. I am rather excited. whee. matrix. On friday I went out with my friend katie to see the faint. We left rather quickly.. the faint sucked it up.. haha. not really.. but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy them as much as I had in the past.. so I was done with it rather quickly.. heh.</description>
