      <description>haha.
anyway.. i am going to build out a new stereo for my room. i am pretty excited. It will be a simple inexpensive/expensive hifi system. some good speakers, a preamp, a good amp, a cd player, an ipod dock and that is about it. I have been excited about the T-amp from Sonic Impact . it is amazing and totally has a little homebrew, hacking movement set around it. I am quite excited - especially about haveing some really cool looking stereo equipment.</description>
