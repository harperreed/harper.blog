      <description>staying up for work is killing me. haha. even thought it was a couple days ago. I obviously need to take this weekend and sleep in. when I just typed sleep. I thought I maybe mispelled it. and when I lookd and it was spelled right I was so confused - cuz I swore I spelled it with a lot of Ls and no Es. whatever. I hate keyboards. they are mean to me.</description>
