      <description>I have always thought that a military action in Iraq without the support of the UN could result in igniting a much larger and more violent conflict. The fact that the middle east is a powder keg waiting to explode and the fact that numerous other geopolitical situations are walking a very thin line leads me to conclude now is not the time for an international conflict - especially one where the only support we have is from Great Britian.</description>
