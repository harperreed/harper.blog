      <description>So I sit her at almost three in the morning with one show off and one shoe on. I have not been home since eight this morning and I have just arrived. I realize that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense.. but whatever. Anyway.. today was weird - I had two rather pivotal meeting at work and about other work.. as well as really got some good stuff done at work.. I then left work to go to the ministry show which started at an ungodly six o clock and on the way I saw the aftermath of some horrible wreck or engagment.</description>
