      <description>I purchased a t-amp awhile ago and have been listening to it in it stock form for the last 5 days. i am quite impressed with it. It is as good if not better than my receiver i had before. Last time i looked to purchase an amp i was frustrated with the availability of stereo only amps that were of good quality and not crazy expensive. so this is a godsend.</description>
