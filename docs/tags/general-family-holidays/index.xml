      <description>Hello everyone.
I have been busy. Threadless just ended its annual holiday sale (went out with a bang). Hiromi and I have been busy getting read for our holiday party with my parents on christmas (today!) and i have been hacking on a bunch of stuff in my spare time. Hiromi made an amazing dinner and we ate it. ;) It was a great time. We missed Dylan and Sarah, but we will hopefully see them soon.</description>
