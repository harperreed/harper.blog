      <description>So I was walking in DIA heading to my terminal when I noticed a set of &amp;ldquo;net terminals.&amp;rdquo; I laughed and thought &amp;ldquo;how nice, free internet. Now there is a business model that will work.&amp;rdquo; I think it was called go2net&amp;hellip; althought io don&amp;rsquo;t really remember. All I know is that they used linux and a slow version of netscape 4 and the terminal next to mine kernal panic&amp;rsquo;d.. hehe..  So anyway, I got to my plane, sat down in my seat and we taxied around the tarmack and then we got all iced up and then we got de-iced then iced and then de-iced and then the crew suddenly worked more than 16 hours and needed a break - so we headed back to a terminal.</description>
