      <description>Bush is now being compared to hitler by his peers. Whoa. In a surprise move, the UN has upset Bush&amp;rsquo;s plans for WAR. I guess they really didn&amp;rsquo;t like his plan all that well. Maybe it was because Iraq has no weapons of mass destrution. &amp;ndash; In other news, there is absolutely no racial profiling by the air marshals. and the &amp;ldquo;terrorists&amp;rdquo; from the south apparently did pay their toll. wtf!</description>
