      <description>The indy 500 rules. it is so totally insane. Last night we rolled in about 10 oclock and arrived amidst a bout of drunken insanity. This man called lurch was doing insane things. not normal things. it was crazy. so we drank a bunch and eventually made it to bed. My brother has a dv cam so we just filled a bunch of crazy stuff. They brought two scooters, and a golf cart.</description>
