      <description>So I am totally sleep deprived. I got back from Japan yesterday and didn&#39;t follow the rules for avoiding jet lag - mainly I went right to sleep and then stayed up all night hanging out. So I decided to stay up all day today as punishment. Then I will go to bed normally and wake up super early! hah. Anyway, while in my sleep deprived state I decided that it would be a good idea to play server and check out why my server was a bit slow lately.</description>
