      <description>Pretty insane. Oink has been raided and the owner has been arrested.
Oink was a really neat tracker. It was apparently fast, clean and super easy. Apparently it was the biggest private bittorrent tracker. Around 180k users. That is a lot of dedicated users.
It taught a bunch of people I know about bittorrent. It was used by anyone from joe smoe to actual musicians. It was a huge music community.</description>
