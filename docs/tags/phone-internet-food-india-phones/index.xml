      <description>tonight was good. I hung out with morgan a bunch. it was pretty weird. honestly. very strange. but it was also great. it is pretty strange - cuz we didn&amp;rsquo;t break up with an absolute reason. it just didn&amp;rsquo;t work out. so. are feelings are pretty much intact. just 3.5 weeks detatched. so yea. it was relaly great to see her and hang out. she hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed in the couple weeks.</description>
