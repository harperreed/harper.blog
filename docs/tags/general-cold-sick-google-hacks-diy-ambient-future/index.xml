      <description>seirously. i just lay in bed. feeling sick. breathing out of my mouth and bummed that i can&amp;rsquo;t sleep.
so i thought up a couple interesting ideas that i would like to take up in the next couple months. First - a set of discrete devices that are connected via a bluetooth PAN. like a small network of ambient devices: a glowing orb, a dial, &amp;ldquo;agent,&amp;rdquo; a couple small black boxes to integrate with stereo&amp;rsquo;s or video signals and of course a way to integrate with cell phones.</description>
