      <description>i hope i haven&amp;rsquo;t made a mistake. we will soon see. heh. i would feel awfully dumb.
i am tryign to get back to the swing of things. i was totally stuck in a limbo world track. i finally finished my alien books. now i have to wait for the dude to finish the fifth one. stupid authors always taking &amp;ldquo;time.&amp;rdquo;
So i want to have a chicago hackathon. i think it woudl be awesome and i have already talked to some peeps who woudl be into it.</description>
