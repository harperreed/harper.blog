      <description>The situation with that girl that was abducted in salt lake city is poised to become very very strange. I mean she was gone for quite a long time. anything can happen in that ime - including befriending ones abductors.. thus patty hearst.. I guess it is probably psychological. but it still makes for a insane story. I think that the US should look at mormans as insane after this. The young girl was married to her abductor in a crazy billigimist marriage.</description>
