      <description>I have needed to update this site for so long. I guess really since last thursday. So last thursday I went out with some friends.. maybe a little too late.. it was all my poor little body could handle. I was horribly sick the next day and had to stay home from work.. which sucks.. cuz work is cool right now.. but whatever. so I slept most of the day - but was supposed to drive to Champaign/urbana for a juggling fest around 11 at night.</description>
