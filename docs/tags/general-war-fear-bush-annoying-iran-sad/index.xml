      <description>I am not a fan of our current administration. I don&amp;rsquo;t like how they work, what they do or what they have done to our country. I haven&amp;rsquo;t voted them in. I have participated in removing them from office - without success. And now that it seems we are on the eve of an attack on Iran, i am not very happy. It is frustrating that a group of people are in power who are not listening to the world, not listening to their constituents and not listening to history.</description>
