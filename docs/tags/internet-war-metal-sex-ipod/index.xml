      <description>so often on the internet you can suddenly run across some picture or whatever that is very nasty. so sometimes geeks obsess with these pictures.. heh. so I sent a link to a picture of this sort to a friend and he responded:ashtar1999 (2:42:37 PM): that was the nastiest thing I have ever seen. Please don&amp;rsquo;t send me links like that, those kind of images flash through my head when I fucking people and it makes me want to die.</description>
