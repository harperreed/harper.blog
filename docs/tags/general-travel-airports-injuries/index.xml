      <description>I hate airports as of yesterday.
It all started about 1.5 months ago. I got word that i was coming to NYC for some work stuff so i went on orbitz and purchased some tickets. about two weeks after that i double checked and noticed much to my surprise that i had purchased tickets for some random weekend in July. wtf. i have never done that before. i pride myself in being rather &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; at the internet and i am usually accurate in my typings - so i must have just flustered and fuxored it all up.</description>
