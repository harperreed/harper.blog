      <description>So tonight.. I played neverwinter nights with matiss&amp;hellip; for quite awhile. it was fun.. then at around 10.. hiromi, cole and myself took the bus to the prodigal son. It was a good time. we hung out. I traded in some of my dvds. they will enjoy thenm I think. My friend pam came over. we hung out for a bit.. and then went to liars club. heh. and we got in for a reduced price because pam is a rockstar.</description>
