      <description>I am rather sleepy. tonight/today was good. I coded all day in anticipation of my new tool being released. I am excited. unfortunantly all my work is going to be looked at as sketchy - cuz the competitor released their &amp;quot;upgrade&amp;quot; which is significantly better than what they had, and rather similar to what I have done. doh! I guess I have to redo and make mine a lot better. ahh.</description>
