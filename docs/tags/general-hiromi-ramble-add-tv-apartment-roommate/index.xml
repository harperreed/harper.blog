      <description>and sleep deprevation is destroying my ADD.
I really feel that ADD helps me work on all my projects. For instance today: I worked on extratasty for 3 hours, I played with the stompbox and the verizon card for 3 hours and I did &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; on some other projects (jacobs sync hah) for awhile. But - it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really in blocks like that - it was threaded. So everything was happening at once.</description>
