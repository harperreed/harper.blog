      <description>Just a warning to all who would read this - i think i was a bit tipsy when writing it. so it is very very ranting and probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.
 I have been playing around in my head with scenarios of what must happen when an organization which has a philosophy of using only open source suddenly finds itself in need of a closed source solution. This seems to me to be an interesting quandary for the poor open source only people.</description>
