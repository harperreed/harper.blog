      <description>but I called the yoyo guys, and they have found my package. it was returned. whew. my yoyos will live&amp;hellip; again.. Yesterday was nice. I went after work to visit marcia at the art institute, we then went to Joy Yee on a whim and had food and great fruit shakes. I love when hanging out is good. like.. not silly or pretentious.. just chill.. after that I went to busy beaver and got the virgin tears and unemployable buttons and then went and to the pelican/melt banana show.</description>
