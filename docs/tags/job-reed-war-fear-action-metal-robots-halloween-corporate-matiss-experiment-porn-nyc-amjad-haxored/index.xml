      <description>so basically I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated this thing in about 3 years. which is a long time. so I am going to &amp;ldquo;update&amp;rdquo; yall as to my whereabouts. so. I got this new job. it is taking a lot of my time. it rules. but I am in a different paradigm than I was when I was at the WB. basically I am totally engaged for 8 hours. I have to be much more accountable and I have to really justify my actions.</description>
