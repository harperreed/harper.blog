      <description>I just watched the beginning of this awesome movie. It was about this women Susan Tom who is raising 11 adopted children all with severe illness or handicaps. It is heart wrenching. I was sitting here trying to find something mindless to put on so i could work with the TV and BAM. sorrow. seriously though - if you have a chance, and a bunch of kleenex - check this movie out.</description>
