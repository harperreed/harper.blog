      <description>contrary to the usual circumstances - I did not go out tonight. weird I know. but I am trying to knock out this website. I would say I am about 80% done. which is good. I did about 40% today. which is also good. so if I don&amp;rsquo;t sleep all day tomorrow I will be able to knock the rest out. one thing I did today that rules - is generate pdf files with php.</description>
