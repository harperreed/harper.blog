      <description>so I have recently been getting more and more random messages from people on friendster. This one really caught my eye. well it caught it by calling me an asshole&amp;hellip; it rules. I was so surprised. at first I was honestly concerned.. but then.. I thought about it. and whatever.. hehe I rule.  How could you have all those friends?? You are such an asshole! I remember you in Chi-town and you were so fucking rude!</description>
