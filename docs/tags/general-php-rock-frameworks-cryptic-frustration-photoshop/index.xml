      <description>i am rather burned out. i have been working with php-mvc frameworks and they are making me not feel smart. it is totally bumming me out.
i need some help. some change. someone to punch me in the eye. eep cryptic. heh. i am soo bored. i guess i just need to represent and figure out what is going on.
eeeek. so frustrated.
time is moving so slow today. i spent 4 hours from 3-5 today.</description>
