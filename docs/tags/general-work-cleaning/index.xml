      <description>So my life was in shambles. but i am feeling it come back. For one. i cleaned my room. that seriously helped. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know i had so much space. i coudl sleep anywhere. basically all i did was remove all the geeky stuff. like the cell phones, the computers, the audreys and the like. the second thing i did - was fix my computers. I changed up hard drives. merged my MP3 Libraries.</description>
