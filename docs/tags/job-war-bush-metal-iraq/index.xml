      <description>The good news is.. I came a accros this really great dj, dj Z-trip. I guess he is doing work for ugh.. linkin park.. but other than that minor character flaw.. he does great remixes.. specifically a cd called &amp;ldquo;uneasy listening.&amp;rdquo; It is a bunch of remixes of pretty good songs.. like metallica and midnight oil mixed together.. wtf.. yep .. its weird..
The bad news is that the US is really dumb.</description>
