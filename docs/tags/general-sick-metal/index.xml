      <description>So last nights late night game playing was maybe not the best idea to quell my sickness. but it ruled so much. we came to my work around 7 to play some half life deathmatch and counterstrike: source. and we left around 3:30am - totally inadvertently. we had planned to leave much earlier cuz both matiss and I have to work in the morning. somehow though.. killing those counter terrorists really got us riled up and not interested in sleep.</description>
