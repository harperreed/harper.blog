      <description>Yesterday was kinnera&amp;rsquo;s birthday. Lets all say happy Birthday to her.  Tonight I went to a shoddy rock show and saw a guy who used to play with the smashing pumpkins. It was wierd because members of the &amp;ldquo;pumpkins&amp;rdquo; were at the show. Often when I see famous people it takes me a little while t figure out that they are real. I guess that is what I get for living in a fantasy world.</description>
