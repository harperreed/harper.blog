      <description>2009 was an awesome year. A lot of amazing things happened in the world of hosting (and a lot happened in the world of Harper too). Being a crazy hosting aficionado, I will summarize my thoughts on hosting in 2009 (I will leave the predictions for 2010). Disclaimer: I am paid money by Rackspace to think about these things. However, I am an equal opportunity hosting consumer. I will try and be as open as possible (but probably a bit biased as well).</description>
