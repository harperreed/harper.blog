      <description>well. basically I feel right now that when you get down it is pretty easy to look up. I just had a meeting. it was really dumb. I stopped listening months ago. hah. just kidding ;) I stopped listening soemtime in the meeting. and then realized that they were talking about something I needed to listen to . so I attempted to replay what had happaned in my mind. it was hard.</description>
