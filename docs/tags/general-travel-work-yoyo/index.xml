      <description>I am in nyc. sitting at tommie&amp;rsquo;s apartment - listening to remixes and puffy electro. awesome.
the yoyo contest was a lot of fun. i inadvertently may have starred in my first &amp;ldquo;porn&amp;rdquo; movie. As a joke on another yoyo player - me and some Duncan kids got naked and recorded over some of their &amp;ldquo;choice footage.&amp;rdquo; Oh yes. it ruled. however. may or will be quite scandalous. Another strike against my presidential campaign.</description>
