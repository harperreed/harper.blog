      <description>Well. I went to milwaukee last night for a friends b-day party. It was funny. I haven&amp;rsquo;t hung out in the college environment in awhile. It is a little wierd. Especially the &amp;ldquo;wisconson&amp;rdquo; college environment. Everyone has a little twang to their speech and they are all big drinkers. I guess that couldbe just college. There were pretty girls there. That is wierd huh. Pretty girls. Today I figured something rather pivitol out.</description>
