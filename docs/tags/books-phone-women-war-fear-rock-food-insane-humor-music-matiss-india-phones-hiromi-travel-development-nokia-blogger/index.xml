      <description>the last couple days have been pretty weird. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like posting at all. which is in itself pretty different. usually I post as a decompression activity - or because I want to say something. however in the last couple days I have really felt that my motivations for posting on my &amp;lsquo;blog&amp;rsquo; were not exactly legit. hah. they were not really illegal - just not necessarily in the same vein as the motivations that usually power a post.</description>
