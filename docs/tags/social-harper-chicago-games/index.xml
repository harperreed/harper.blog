      <description>I want to start a play group. I want to have one night a week, a group of kids gets together and does an activity. I want one of the activities to be watching twin peaks, another of the activities to be playing risk or other games, and the other would be .. hmm.. something cool. I would try and get the people to all hang out together.. creating a &amp;ldquo;social group&amp;rdquo; like environment.</description>
