      <description>work is awesome again. on friday I did a bunch of stuff getting acclimated with flash and such. kinda fun. then I got bored and wne to drop off some cds to my &amp;ldquo;boss.&amp;rdquo; he was in his office with this dude listening to music. they were listening to death from above 1979. so I hung out and we all talked about death metal for about 40 minutes. totally awesome. I love it.</description>
