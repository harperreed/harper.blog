      <description>so lasts nights performance was lame. I mean it was OK from a juggling perspective. we barely dropped and we &amp;ldquo;looked&amp;rdquo; good.. hehe. (pictures to come)- but the show was dumb. I wish we had a real band to juggle with. heh.  This site is really great. I really enjoyed the pictures. so I made a script that picks a random one and displays it. the script is here. just keep reloading.</description>
