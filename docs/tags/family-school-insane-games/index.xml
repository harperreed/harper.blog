      <description>so this weekend was really weird. on friday I hung out and went to bed early because I had to take a practive lsat on saturday. the lsat turned out to be hard. weird. wtf. haha. the logic games were a bit trickier than I previously thought. it was nice to be challenged in a way that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been challenged in a long long time. go school. so then on saturday I slept off and on and eventually went out with morgan to this place called trevia - it is nice to hang out with her.</description>
