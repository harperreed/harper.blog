      <description>besides everything going absolutely apeshit at work this afternoon.. due to simple miscommunication and confusion - I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to work on my server. However, I was a diligent worker bee and got it all working and installed. RULE. my imap sever is giving me hell. my pop and smtp servers seem to be working. and QMAIL is the bomb. HA. I don&amp;rsquo;t need no stinking mail servers.. hahaah</description>
