      <description>So i went to the doctor yesterday and was like &amp;ldquo;what the hell is wrong with my broke ass foot&amp;rdquo; and the doctor was like &amp;ldquo;well what have you eaten recently?&amp;rdquo; heh. wtf. eating and feet are related. apparently if you drink a lot and eat mostly hotdogs - they are. so i guess i have goutted up my big toe and am working on fixing it. its pretty retarded - expecially that it occured right after i consumed more meat and rich food than i had in probably a year.</description>
