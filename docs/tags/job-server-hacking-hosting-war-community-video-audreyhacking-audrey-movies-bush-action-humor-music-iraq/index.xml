      <description>i really need to upgrade servers. I need like 3 more. One for a firewall, one for web hosting and one for backups. That would rule.  i price them at around 4k. So if anyone wants to give me 4k. I would be happy ;)So apparently audreyhacking.com is in wired this month. Somewhere around page 75. I really need to go and buy a copy. I will put some scans up.</description>
