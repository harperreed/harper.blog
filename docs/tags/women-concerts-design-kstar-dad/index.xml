      <description>Oh boy, oh boy. Last night kstar came up and we went to the Britney Spears concert. We sat in our seats and realized that we were surrounded by screaming 13 year olds. It was insanity. O-town opened for her and they were horrible. They had a hip hop part.. they sang the puff daddy song &amp;ldquo;wanna be a baller,&amp;rdquo; it was funny the only guys who rapped were the &amp;ldquo;ethnic&amp;rdquo; guys.</description>
