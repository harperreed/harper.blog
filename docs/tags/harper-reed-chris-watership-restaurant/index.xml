      <description>saturday night we went to this resturant called mas where we were meeting some friends. As soon as we arrived this guy started talkign to us and eventually purchased each of us (Thom, Chris and myself) many MAS MARGARITA then some MOJITO and finally some CAIPIRINHA this was also accompanied by a shot of tequila and sprite. It was great. He was a really nice guy. so so funny. The rest of our guests arrived so we got a table and sat down.</description>
