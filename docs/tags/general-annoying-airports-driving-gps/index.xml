      <description>Dylan is driving me and Sarah to my grandfathers house, as I write this. its pretty funny that technology has brought us this far. I cant wait to see the future&amp;hellip; again. so traveling is fun. but flying is so damned annoying. the security checkpoints are really ineffective and just cause problems. seriously - what good is it doing to limit the number/size of the toiletry carry on. I mean wtf.</description>
