      <description>So tonight i was awesome. I mean. i am always pretty awesome. but tonight i really ruled. I have been trying to send a text message to eveyone in my phone book saying the caption from the family circus cartoon on the right: &amp;ldquo;Oh my god. I can see forever.&amp;rdquo; However - my phone kept crashing whenever i adding more than 100 people to a text message. So tonight i figured - while waiting on the train i would go ahead and break it up into a bundle of smaller messages and see how it worked out.</description>
