      <description>I recently came back from a nice little vacation. My girlfriend and myself have dated a little over one year recetnly and we had a nice weekend together. It was quite something. To experience all the things we have experienced together. To have a best friend be the same person you love and adore. To have all of those feelings be reciprocated. Boy howdy I enjoy it. hehe. Well, I got her a nice surprise and she liked it.</description>
