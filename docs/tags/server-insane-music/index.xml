      <description>This weekend was fun. it also passed in a blur. on friday night I went to the silliest party I have been to in a long time. It was for a movie casting - however none of my friends or myself new that it was a movie casting - so we just hung out and got free drinks.. such a silly thing.. so dumb. everyone with their head shots.. trying to impress no one in particular.</description>
