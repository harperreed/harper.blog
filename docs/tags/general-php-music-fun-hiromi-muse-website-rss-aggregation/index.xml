      <description>First off - this is the most amazing music video i have ever seen. There is very little hyperbole in that statement. And since jacob has shown me that music video, i have been listening to muse like a madman. Such a funny video. Amazing.
Second - i made this website that aggregates hiromi and my blogs and flickr pictures into a nice little website. So you can check it out our posts and pictures all in one place.</description>
