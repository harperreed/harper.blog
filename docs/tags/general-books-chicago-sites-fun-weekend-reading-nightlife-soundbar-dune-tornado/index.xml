      <description>This weekend was pretty fun. I guess most of my weekends are. This one started out super weird. On Friday&amp;nbsp;I was supposed to go to the sox game with Robyn. However, as I was leaving work - there was a tornado. haha. actually I was sitting,&amp;nbsp;finishing up some stuff at work and the air raid/ tornado sirens started up. It was insane. I have never heard those. I thought we were going to get bombed.</description>
