      <description>once again theree is a carnival in front of my house. it is quite strange. rather confusing really. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever imagined waking up to the wonderful sounds of the carnival. but whataver.. heh. tonight I went to innjoy to see my friends brock and amanda dj. they are nice deejays. they play electro, which is becoming fun to listen to. I really do feel that industrial music will spawn from this.</description>

      <description>so I went and saw the faint.. it was great. they were good a little bit canned. however I saw one of my friends who let me in on the secret of the &amp;ldquo;indie rock undrworld&amp;rdquo; a little joint called watusi.. where even I can pass as a suceeding or not suceeding musician.. underground or whatnot. heh. &amp;ldquo;when I released my record in englan&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;i loved that show.. I saw them a long time ago.</description>
