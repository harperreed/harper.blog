      <description>Hehe. Last night was a great night. I think its funny that have made this weblog become a &amp;ldquo;log&amp;rdquo; of my nights out. heh. Well anyway.. Matiss and I juggled at this club called Twelve12. It was really fun. a lot more fun than I thought it was going to be. Crazy fun. We met a bunch of cool people.. hung out with beautiful models ;) and basically just chilled.. so funny.</description>
