      <description>yep.  what is frustrating to me is the people who are all &amp;ldquo;oh yea see bush is right&amp;rdquo; and all this crap about politics when they just started paying attention it a week ago. then they gloat and act like they were right all along. well I just welcome them to the world which they have helped create. hopefully they will enjoy it as much as I will. mmm, candy</description>
