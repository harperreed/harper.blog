      <description>Man. This really gets my goat.
I have always had an interest in accessibility of technology by people who are differently abled, but i usually concentrated on seniors and children. It never occurred to me the challenges that a deaf person would have interacting with mobile phones and all that (I mean - i was aware that such challenges existed, i just never interacted directly with someone who had experience). About 6-8 months ago i met this guy Brendan at a conference.</description>
