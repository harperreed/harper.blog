      <description>Last night I was possibly supposed to hang out with this friend/aquaintence. it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen so I went to lula and ate dinner with my laptop. I was able to get a bunch of work done, eat a really incredible meal(salmon with rubarb and parschnips.. heh.) and get desert and all that. Since I was all by myself at the resturant I was sitting up at the front bar area, so when another person came by themselves they sat with me.</description>
