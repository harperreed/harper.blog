      <description>I have been working at skinnyCorp for about 2.4 years. We have grown a lot in that time. It is really cool to think about. When I started, we had 3 servers, a lot of traffic and were selling quite a few shirts a day. Now, we are approaching 40 servers, a veritable ass load of traffic and we are selling a lot of shirts. It has been awesome to be a part of growing the technology behind Threadless in a pace that matches the community.</description>
