      <description>This last couple days have been insane. So obviously i was in nyc working. then i hung out and partied all night in manhatten with amjad. That ended with us eating tater tots at 4 in the morning. and INCREDIBLE idea. seriously. whoever invented that was smart. S M R T. then the plane fiasco.
now i am at work. making stuff happen. I am flying out tonight to san fran for some fun with the gravitymobile guys.</description>
