      <description>My firend ladawn is in town. It is really fun to have her arond. I like it. I wish she was moving to chicago. hehe.  A lot of my friends from college have converged on chicago this year. It is nice. One of them even moved in accross the street.. unbeknownst to us. 
anyway.. check out my new website a500hacking.com. It is getting pretty big. I am such a fan of communtiy websites.</description>
