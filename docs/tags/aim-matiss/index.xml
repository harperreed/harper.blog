      <description>Tonight was fantastic. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I have used fantastic to describe a night in awhile. I went and got some new clothes, matiss and I went to the Art Institute&amp;rsquo;s graduate art show(It is real real good and huge) and then we hung out with a cool new friend and we went to see spider man. I really enjoyed both.  The movie was quite something. It was incredibly funny and sam raimi has proven himself to be the master of kitsch.</description>
