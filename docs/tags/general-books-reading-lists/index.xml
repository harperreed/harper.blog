      <description>I thought I would give a rundown of some&amp;nbsp;of the books I have been reading recently. In the last couple weeks, I have been interested in non-fiction reading.&amp;nbsp; I go through phases were I am suddenly really into books on different sociological issues. For instance, the hikikomori book I read awhile ago, and my fascination with any book that is about Chicago and Urban issues. So anyway - I will tell you what I have been reading and what I am in the middle of.</description>
