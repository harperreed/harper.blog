      <description>one of three choices:  Fiery death from a high rise building War! Nuclear War Bush&amp;rsquo;s Missile Crisis Corporate office job  So many choices. I will choose Office job. Thank you. Apparently Gore doesn&amp;rsquo;t much like Bush&amp;rsquo;s economic strategy. I don&amp;rsquo;t much like Bush&amp;rsquo;s call for a Domestic spy agency. I get scared enough when they start appropriating private militia for government use, let alone when my tax dollars pay for me to get arrested for haveing a liberal anti-war website - eep.</description>
