      <description>tonight I went and brainstormed with john and hannah for hours. it was mind numbing. afterwards we kidnapped marcia and took her to smokedaddy&amp;rsquo;s. I had never been there, and I had never really heard of it. however it was quite good. I had a briskett sandwich. it ruled. I got all dirty. I ate so much so fast. sometiems beer and food tastes so damn good. it is pretty funny.</description>
