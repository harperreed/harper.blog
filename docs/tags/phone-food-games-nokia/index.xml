      <description>tonight was nice. we played games. ate some food. hung out. it was nice. I finally got to spend time with all my friends - in a more chill out way. it was nice. I am tired. but in that &amp;ldquo;i slept until 1ish&amp;rdquo; sort of way. I need to sleep. get up. unfortunantly goto work. and do lots of work. then I will get food. hang out with carl. hang out with morgan.</description>
