      <description>at about 3. I then went to watcht the incredibles with hiromi. it ruled. I liked it a lot.  then I went to target and got a no region dvd player. it ruled. we then came home and watched zatoichi. soooo good. I am sleepy nwo - however I MUST clean my room. it is a mess for sure. recently I have been thinking a lot about some decisions I made in the last week - I think I mistreated one of my friends.</description>

      <description>you may have seen a couple entries back that I won a caseful of diamonds on ebay. Well they arrived yesterday. So we took them out on the town. Check the results out. Fun Fun. Yesterday I also received a bulk box of snap-pops and a king diamond poster. What luck. I love ebay. So last night was hiromi and matts art show. It was nice. A lot of people were there which made it quite fun.</description>
