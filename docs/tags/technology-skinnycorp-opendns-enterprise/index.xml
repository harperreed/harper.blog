      <description>This is a followup to the post about openDNS from July 10th. So we used openDNS for a couple days. It worked really well. Then it failed. We were all trying to do something and no one in the office was having DNS issues. So we rolled it back.
I think if there were a couple more servers - or it was distributed a bit more i would be more apt to use it in this &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; way.</description>
