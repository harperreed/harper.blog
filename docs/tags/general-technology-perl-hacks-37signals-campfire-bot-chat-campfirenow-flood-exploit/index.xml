      <description>Oh yea. I forgot to mention that i released a new version of my campfirenow.com bot framework. It is quite a bit better and a lot more robust - however i imagine that 37signals has changed things to stop it.
Check out the source: here
I also released a proof of concept flood. its real annoying and stupid. don&amp;rsquo;t use it. i just wanted to see if i could make it.</description>
