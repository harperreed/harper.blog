      <description>today was kinda rough. morgan and I had a discussion last night that ended with our pretty much breaking up. it sucks quite a bit. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t mean for this to happen. and I don&amp;rsquo;t really know if she did either. but I am also not sure if it is something that is reconciliable or if it is just a situation that sucks and will not become &amp;ldquo;fixed.&amp;rdquo; the reasons are all valid, and rational.</description>
