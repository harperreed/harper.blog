      <description>i listened to cat power on the way to work. man. that music is sad. hah. I think one of my favorite songs by her is &amp;ldquo;good women.&amp;rdquo; hmm. kinda sad. ;)last night was pretty fun. I went and saw black print at the double door, then I went and I hung out with severn and val at danny&amp;rsquo;s. it was fun to hang out with them. I realized while walking to danny&amp;rsquo;s by myself - that I really shoudln&amp;rsquo;t just hang out with my room.</description>
