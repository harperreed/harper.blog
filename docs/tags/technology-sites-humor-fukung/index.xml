      <description>I was thinking about how I have a lot of domains that are not being used and how that pisses me off. It is annoying to have a domain that costs 12 bucks or whatever (stupid joker) and isn&amp;rsquo;t making money - when I could. And a lot of times I am not really mad about it not making money - just mad it isn&amp;rsquo;t being used. I wish I either had a lot of energy, money, or an extra arm to finish all the sites I want to.</description>
