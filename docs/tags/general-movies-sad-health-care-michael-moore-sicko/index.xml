      <description>The other night i was somehow able to see Michael Moore&#39;s new movie: Sicko. It was amazing. Really sad and funny at the same time. It told me what i already knew - but added a bunch of person touches to it as well. One thing it mentioned that I didn&#39;t know - was that Cuba is a mecca for good medicine and is involved in bringing medicine to a lot of other third world countries.</description>
