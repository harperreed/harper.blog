      <description>I love jabber. I love Google talk because it is jabber. I really like what jabber supports and how it works. And the Google talk desktop app is pretty smooth. A couple weeks ago Google released Google talk gadget that allowed group chatting. This was super weird since the flash based gadget has totally blown the desktop app out of the water - in regards to features. What is annoying is that they are limiting the groups feature to Google talk accounts.</description>
