      <description>but I did manage to arrive to work at a decent time. not the 4:00 I feared while attempting to fall asleep last night at 4:00am. I don&amp;rsquo;t look well rested. heh. hopefully in a couple minutes/hours/days. haha. I need a nap. already. and I barely got up a couple minutes ago. heh. a movie was being filmed on the way to work today. it was pretty crazy. mostly cuz all of a sudden there was a billion people on my way to work.</description>
