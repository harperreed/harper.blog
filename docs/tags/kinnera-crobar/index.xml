      <description>I just finished watching ghost world. I am not sure if my time has been wasted or not. I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. But you never know. heh. this weekend was quite good. I had a lot of friends over and went out to a lot of clubs. I also spent far too much money for the amount of return I got. But that is OK. It was really funa dn I was able to lose all of my worries for one weekend.</description>
