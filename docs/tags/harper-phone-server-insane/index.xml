      <description>here are some pics I took with my cameraphone and my laser. the first one is me in my bedroom the laser is being scanned across my chest. the second is a swirl being projected on my book shelf. the third is what happens when you shine a 5mW laser into a really poor digicam. the fourth is the laser being swirled on my servers.. the green laser is incredible at night.</description>
