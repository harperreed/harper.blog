      <description>so I really don&amp;rsquo;t believe in god or jesus or the like.. but this is awesome. So apparently mel gibson has lost his mind and is making a movie about the &amp;ldquo;real story&amp;rdquo; of christ. and while they were filming.. the guy playing christ was struck by lightning. hahahahahahahahaha.. seriously.. and the assistent director was hit as well. for the second time since they started shooting.. &amp;ldquo;a producer described how he saw lightning come out of the actor&amp;rsquo;s ear.</description>
