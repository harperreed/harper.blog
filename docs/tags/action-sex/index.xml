      <description>i just watched an awesome movie called they live. it rules. ruled something fierce. I laughed very hard for most of the movie. it had great lines, terrible acting and ended with a sex scene. it wasn&amp;rsquo;t believable and the action was horrible. in terms of a horrible but awesome movie. this was number one. i have about given up on the tivo. it is SOOOOOOO hard. I hate it. hate it a lot.</description>
