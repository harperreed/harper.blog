      <description>so I was cleaning out my server and somehow(well I know how.. but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into it) I accidently(it was an accident.. but it was scripted and it could have been avoided) deleted a bunch of email accounts of my friends :(. so sad. stupid imap. so handy. so dangerous.  don&amp;rsquo;t you think it is interesting that buchanan has support from the left and the right. he is so far to whatever side is far on that he is both sides.</description>
