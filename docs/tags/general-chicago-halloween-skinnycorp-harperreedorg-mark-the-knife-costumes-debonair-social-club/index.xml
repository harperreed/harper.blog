      <description>Ahh Halloween. How I love the city during Halloween. It is absolutely madness. This Halloween was quite a bit of fun. Not as crazy as last year - but more fun. On Friday skinnycorp had a nice Halloween party that I was responsible for. We had mark the knife perform and some really awesome costumes. The only bummer part was that I didn&#39;t get dinner and ended up getting rather drunk toward the end of the night.</description>
