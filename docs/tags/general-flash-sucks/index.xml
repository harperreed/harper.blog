      <description>Seriously. It is killing me. I am rather frustrated.
So i was reading russell&amp;rsquo;s post on flash lite and was like &amp;ldquo;yippee.. more s60 software for my shiny n70.&amp;rdquo; and i clicked his fancy link to macromedia.com page to &amp;ldquo;buy&amp;rdquo; the software. Well. after filling out 30 goddamn forms and clicking all around this really stupid flash app - i finally got to a place where i can download the file.</description>
