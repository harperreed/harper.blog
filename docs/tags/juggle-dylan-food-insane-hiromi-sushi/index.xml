      <description>Friday I about died from hunger. I got home from work.. .actually .. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get home form work. I went straight to atomix coffee shop and met dylan and hiromi.. also.. rachel, hans, marcia and nicole were all there. so it was awesome. we then hurried home and went to heat. heat was intense. we got a live fish and a bunch of really good sushi. I think that it was good.</description>
