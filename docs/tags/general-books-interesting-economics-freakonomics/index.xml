      <description>Last night, I started and finished Freakonomics. It was awesome and hilarious. I have been reading the freakonomics blog for a year or so - and I decided I finally needed to read the book. I enjoy Stephen&amp;nbsp;Levitt&amp;rsquo;s discussion of things that I never thought about. I especially liked the chapters about Chicago gangs. Sudhir Venkatesh was amazing. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what it was like to study and hang out with the Gangster Disciples.</description>
