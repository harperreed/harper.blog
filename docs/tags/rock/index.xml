      <description>i can&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to get prepaid gprs. so no photolog. :( sad day. oh and before I forget. they played classic rock elevator muzak in the domestic flight here. like joe walsh and such. it ruled. I was like: &amp;ldquo;i suddenly recognize these songs.. weird.&amp;rdquo; it ruled. the same muzak is apparently everywhere. like in the bathroom and the kfc. haha. why was I in a kfc? I don&amp;rsquo;t know.</description>

      <description>So last night I went to go and see public enemy. It was fun however flava flav was not present. Apparently he is in jail. wtf. hehe. but the show was great anyway. kinda weird.. but chuck D rocked it hard.. then I went to a bar and my friend kept getting me drinks. I hate that. heh</description>
