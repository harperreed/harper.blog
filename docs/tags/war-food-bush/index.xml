      <description>omfg. so that sucked. it was pretty harrowing to watch unfold. I mean. it appeared that we didn&amp;rsquo;t even have a chance. and then I started drinking. which made the whole thing rediculous. I am now sleepy from drinking too much with too little food and too little consideration for reality. all I remember is laying on my bed and calling for my friends. then wooosh - morning. heh. and then we get bush for another four years.</description>
