      <description>I was in another fasion show on friday. IT was at a crazy little place called le passage. The scene was silly, however Art and science did hair and I love them. haha. Then on saturday and sunday We went to the toss up juggling festival. It was great as well. We came in second in numerous competitions, including 7 club endurence, 10 club feed endurence, and others. anyway. I am way boring right now.</description>
