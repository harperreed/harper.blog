      <description>Today I got access to the Google Mashup Editor. it is really nifty. I like it. The samples are amazing. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to sit down and play with it comprehensively. its really neat that the data is accessible with the gdata api.
I think that combining this and yahoo pipes could lead to interesting results. Making a language translating feed reader, or a yahoo local/Google base mashup. Combining the magic of feeds with the webapp magic of Google mashup editor.</description>
