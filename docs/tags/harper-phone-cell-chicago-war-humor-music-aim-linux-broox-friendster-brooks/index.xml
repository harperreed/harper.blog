      <description>So I have been trashing my blog by quoting aim and such. it is nice and humorous but it totally throughs of the blog feel and makes it kinda childish. I really don&amp;rsquo;t like it. but I am still laughignabout this prank I pulled on my friend scott - so I will share it with yall.. it is the last one for awhile.. (unless I continue to be awesome)So the setup was that I wanted to play a joke on scott.</description>
