      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it has something to do with the motorcycle gas that runs in my blood (a lot of my relatives are &amp;ldquo;bikers&amp;rdquo;) or if it is my dream of looking and being like madmax. Whatever it is - I really like how the Sachs Madass looks. Today at lunch we were walking down Broadway and saw one locked up. It looks insane. It seems to be the melding of a custom scooter, a moped and a homemade motorcycle.</description>
