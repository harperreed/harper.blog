      <description>I know I know. I have been a bad bad blogger. I basically I have been ignoring the fact that I have a blog. For a long time - - pretty much since I got back from japan at the beginning of January. eep. What weird is that I have been playing computer a lot - but mostly doing workish things. it made it hard to justify blogging when I had 100 things on my plate.</description>
