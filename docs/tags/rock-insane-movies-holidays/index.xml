      <description>so this weekend was pretty fun. on friday I hung out with morgan and we went to a art opening at my friend lenores gallery. the opening was fun - but the hanging out was really good. after this event, we went to a party where a pinata filled with cayan pepper was exploded prior to our arrival. it was rather abrasive on my poor nasal passage ;). we hung out here and drank rather rough gin drinks until we got hungry enough to leave.</description>
