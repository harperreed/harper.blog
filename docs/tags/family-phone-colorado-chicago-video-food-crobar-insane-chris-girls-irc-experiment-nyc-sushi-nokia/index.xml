      <description>this is dumb. heh. BREAKING THE LAW!! this weekend was pretty fun. I got my hair severly cut on friday. no more mullet, rattail or peyos. sad day. but is is a nice change. I am happy about it. I also got some color as well so it is all good. I really like it. it did take some getting used to - as I had that haircut for almost 2 years and I had the peyos for like 6 years.</description>
