      <description>So I lost reality the other night. I was sittign at work - going live with this product (FINALLY) amd I noticed reality slinking out the door(1, 2, 3). I was pretty sure at that point that my life was going to get weird, so as any good boy would do - I just gave in and drank a lot more mt. dew. so what happened was this. we (WB) went live with this product on wednesday night.</description>
