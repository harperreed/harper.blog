      <description>anyway.. I am sitting here, back at work, typing this entry in lynx - cuz my windows and primary desktop broke good. ;) I have replaced the hard drive and I am now installing win2k .. whee what fun. I cannot remember when I have had such fun. So .. christmas was entertaining. I enjoyed it. I miss hanging with my parents and stuff already. I really like them. however now I get to see Miriam and hang out with my friends so that is super cool.</description>
