      <description>So everything worked out and Hiromi and I were married on tuesday. It was really fun. and really barely more than signing a paper. which i liked quite a bit. Today we did the first part of the visa stuff. It was insane. and really crazy. totally stressful. government offices are annoying and really bureaucratic. i felt like i was in a terry gilliam movie. hah. But we are almost done - and the next part doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be too much different than this part - just a bit more &amp;ldquo;official.</description>
