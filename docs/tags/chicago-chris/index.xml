      <description>A week and a half ago chris saathoff was killed by a drunk driver. It is pretty sad (of course) - but watching his blog stop and his friends react. the news story is rather sad as well. sometimes it is strange living in the city. with all the crap that goes on.. the gangs, the violence that is around us but &amp;ldquo;not&amp;rdquo; affecting us. wtf. it is dumb.</description>
