      <description>Everyone at worked has been talking about Lost incessantly since I started working at skinnyCorp. It was driving me mad - mostly because they kept talking about all sorts or interesting things. Things that didn&#39;t make sense and it was completely infuriating. I was completely taken in, without even seeing or knowing anything about it. The final straw was the alternative reality game the Lost people put on. It was absolutely madness.</description>
