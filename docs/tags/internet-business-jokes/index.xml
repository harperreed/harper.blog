      <description>I forgot to mention in my last post that I went and saw the show producers. What a funny show it is. Boy howdy. heh. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard anything about it so I was quite surprised. Matthew Broderick was very good as was the understudy for nathan lane(alas he couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it). It was quite funny. some of the jokes caught me quite off guard. heh. being in new york, and seeing a lot of hasidic jews.</description>
