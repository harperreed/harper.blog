      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; alt=&#34;Ibook Picture Frame&#34; src=&#34;http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3842.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted a digital picture frame. I originally thought that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.audreyhacking.com&#34;&gt;audrey &lt;/a&gt; would fulfill my need - but it became apparent that i needed something much more powerful. I needed something that i could manage remotely and could run reasonable programs on. I needed a technology that would allow me to use open source software to display and manipulate the pictures as well as possible. I thought of using a custom linux solution - but decided that it would be cost prohibitive. I also noticed that there are a handfull of good picture frame tutorials already on the internet - so i checked them out and noticed a really nice powerbook &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.applefritter.com/node/view/4971&#34;&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.applefritter.com/hacks/duodigitalframe/index.html&#34;&gt;apple duo&lt;/a&gt; hack and got to thinking about my roommates old clamshell ibook sitting in the corner&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
