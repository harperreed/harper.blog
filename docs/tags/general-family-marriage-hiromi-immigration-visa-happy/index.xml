      <description>So this evening/Japanese morning Hiromi had her final visa interview. Everything went great. She got her visa and now she can come to the US. It is awesome how smooth everything has been in regards to our government/embassy/visa experience. I really think the key is how prepared we were.&amp;nbsp; We spent a lot of time making sure that the forms and what not were filled out appropriately. It was pretty awesome.</description>
