      <description>for the love of god it was a great weekend. Work has been interesting. a lot of drama and going forwards-ness. it is nice. finally stuff is getting done. but at the expense of a lot of comfortability and weird weird situations. anyway..On friday I came home and took a nap. I talked with ladawn a bunch on the phone which was awesome, she seems to be doing wonderful. I decided that my room is a complete mess, but I am going to have to deal with it :( - whatever.</description>
