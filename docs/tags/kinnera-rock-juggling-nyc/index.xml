      <description>well maybe not quite that extreme - but a bunch of cool/fun things happened today. first I was attacked on a juggling b board about my rattail - so I defended&amp;hellip; a bit unsuccessfully - but I tried. then I am going to be helping with a secret project. which is going to rule. last night I yoyoed a bunch with mark.. and then hung out with morgan. it is nice to hang with morgan.</description>
