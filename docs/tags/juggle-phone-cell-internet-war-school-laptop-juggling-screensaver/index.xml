      <description>i find myself in an airport terminal.. using my trusty cell phone as internet access. I was noticing today that I have magically switched my palm pilot for my laptop. weird. I mean the laptop isn&amp;rsquo;t much bigger.. but still - I can&amp;rsquo;t fit it in my pocket and I can&amp;rsquo;t use it to navigate my palm..I am going to LA in an hour to see my brother graduate from commercial diving school.</description>
