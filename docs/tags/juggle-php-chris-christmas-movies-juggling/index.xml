      <description>Last night we watched the first full length movie on my new TV. It was nice.. especially with my new receiver. heh. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do about my old receiver.. but whatever - we watched the new Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the ring with all the extra footage and such. whee.. I like that movie.. I have watched it far too many times.. It was a nice gathering though.</description>
