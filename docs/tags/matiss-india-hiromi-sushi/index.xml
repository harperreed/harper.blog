I was planning on working at 12 - but then I call my coworker and she was like &amp;ldquo;oh no - you don&amp;rsquo;t have to work&amp;rdquo; - so I went out. then when I got home. india called and was like - &amp;ldquo;everything isn&amp;rsquo;t working how it is supposed to work&amp;rdquo; so I had to do a bunch of stuff until around 3:30. heh. then I slept until 10.</description>
