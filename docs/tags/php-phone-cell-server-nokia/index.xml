      <description>i was complaining about not having a really solid way to upload images from my phone to my server. I was using my MMS to photolog script, which totally worked good. but I needed a way to get ALL of the pictures from my camera to my server without havign to bluetooth them and then ftp them and then move them. so I found this php nokia image server , configured it, rewrote a bit of it.</description>
