      <description>So last night my brother graduated college. It was probably the most entertaining graduation ceremony I have seen in a long long time. One of the speakers kept swearing and cussing.. hehe. and everyone kept gasping at what he was saying. but he kept it up - it was so funny. I laughed a bunch. Only 20 or so people graduated. so it was a very small group. After the ceremony we went to dinner at this nice sea food resturant.</description>
