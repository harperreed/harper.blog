      <description>So I was rather sick yesterday.. I felt like hell. so I slept from 6-10 and then hung out from 10-11 and then went back to bed. but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep. all I could do was become delerious. so after imagining ghosts and thinking of horror movie plots I finally managed to goto bed around 2am. suxor. I had crazy dreams. sometimes being sick is fun. I lov ethe side effects.</description>
