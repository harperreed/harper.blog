      <description>This weekend, my family is going to Japan to hang out with Hiromi&amp;rsquo;s friends and family. It should be absolutely madness. I am very excited.
I like not having to deal with Jesus during the holidays. Its nice to be able to supplant tradition with something new and totally different. Like going to Japan.
The plan thus far is to hang out in Tokyo for a couple days and then make our way to Yamanashi for a party on the 28th.</description>
