      <description>So this weekend was pretty cool. On friday i took a long nap and went to smart bar with kira. Mark verbos was doing his live P.A. bit. It was pretty awesome. I really like the knob tweaking and acidish noise that occurs whenever mark does his thing. The new smartbar is really dope. Crazy lighting, and an incredible sound system. Seriously. and INCREDIBLE sound system. It is massive. Nice work on that.</description>
