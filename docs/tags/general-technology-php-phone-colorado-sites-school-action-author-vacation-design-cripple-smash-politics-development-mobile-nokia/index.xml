      <description>check out this comic. so very very true. unfortunately it is being banned by newspapers all over. too bad it is true. heh. I love shit like that. Some really exciting things are going down right now. I am almost finished with my fathers site and should be moving on to another couple sites. I started another project and have bundles more to do. stupid projects. always taking my time. one of the cooler projects I started is a port of the bbs door cripple smash.</description>
