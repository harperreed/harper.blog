      <description>today has been pretty good so far. last night was fun. I went to juggling club. yoyoed a bunch and then went to see the stare play at the mutiny. god I hate the mutiny. but the stare was awesome. so funny. I had never seen matt play guitar before - so it was an educational experience. heh. i got hiromi a domo-kun. she likes it a lot.i am starting to make preparations for my trip to india.</description>
