      <description>Last night I went to this electro party. it was OK. it was a HUGE space and their was not enough people to fill it up. However - it was rather well executed and overall it did a good job as a party. my friend Chris DJ&amp;rsquo;d and that ruled.. but some cats were pissed.. cuz his headphones were similiar to their previously stolen ones. wtf. speaking of headphones. - I got my new ones.</description>
