      <description>I am watching tv and the women on the TV has awesome glasses. they are huge. I am watching a pretty sad documentary about two kids from chicago poor neighborhoods that are trying to get into the NBA. it is good. a bummer. life certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t fair.
This weekend rocks. Last night was the lollapalooza preparty at crobar. it was madness. Chris Holmes is here, Tommie Sunshine is here, everyone is back.</description>
