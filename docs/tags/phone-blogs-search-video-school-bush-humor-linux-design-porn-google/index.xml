      <description>so I am reading beowulf (or is it this). it is interesting to read for fun what I once rejected reading for school. however it really brings me back to all the discussions we had about the text. sometimes literary critique is fun. other times i hate it. 
i am going to get a new website. probably with these guys - maybe plan 3. I really want a terrantula. I LOVE spiders.</description>
