      <description>First off.. they wrote a good piece of software. They wrote the original gnutella client and leaked enough info out for it to be easily reverse engineered and propagated. but AOL pulled it. they recently released a program called waste that was removed from the website by AOL. Since it was removed, nobody is able to download it. I really enjoy watching justin frankel totally fuck with AOL. What really gets me is this rather humorous post on DADD (Dating Attention Deficit Disorder).</description>
