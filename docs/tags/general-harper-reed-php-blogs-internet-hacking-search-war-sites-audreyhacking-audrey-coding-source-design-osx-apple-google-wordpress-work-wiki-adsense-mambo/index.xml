      <description>where the deer and the antelope play. where seldom is heard a discouraging word. and the eyes eat cowboys all day. Oh yea. it is the weekend. I am soooo sleepy. I am going to have a meet and greet. and then have a meet and sleep. and then WHAMO. saturday. then sunday. then work. wooohooo
in the mean time I am going to attempt to hook howtoyoyo into mambo as well as audreyhacking - hopefully by putting all my sites into one CMS I will have a quicker workflow for chanegs and such.</description>
