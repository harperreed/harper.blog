      <description>seriously. I was just sitting here at home waiting for things to happen. and BAM something happened. I got an email from minmouse@sbcglobal.net. heh. rule. here it is:  Hey Faggot, At least I&amp;rsquo;ll wake up who I am tomorrow&amp;hellip;.. But Nata&amp;rsquo;s RETARD, well he will still be RETARDED in the am. You faggot will still wake up a faggot in the morning.  I am apparently am going to wake up someone who I am not tomorrow - if I compare myself to that guy.</description>
