      <description>So a a friend found one of the most bizarre collection of pictures in awhile: here. It seems that this dude mike(as far as I can tell that is him) likes to have pictures of women. But the repository also has a lot of personal pictures as well. It just gets my voyeuristic juices a flowin. that along with MOC an weblog reading of course. i normally don&amp;rsquo;t want to post shite like those pics.</description>

      <description>Today at work we discussed what unix utility we would take on a deserted island if we hand to choose one or two. I choose grep and regular expressions. So you could globally replace bananas with women. heh</description>

      <description>I saw Jane&amp;rsquo;s Addiction tonight. it was a great show. very Very good. Perry Farrell too koff his clothes and danced around in his polo underwear and calvin klein socks. very humerous. I much enjoyed it. They had dancing very almost naked women. It was quite something. Well goodnight&amp;hellip;</description>
