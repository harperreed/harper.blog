      <description>I broke my blog the other day. It was a pain in the ass. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what happened - just that it broke. So I was thinking, I hate upgrading my wordpress. I hate it. I agree 100% with Matt Cutts about how wordpress has one of the most clunky and cruft creating upgrade process. So annoying. And it gets even more annoying when you are doing it with 50 blogs.</description>
