      <description>So I am in colorado.. hanging out with my parents and my brother. it is a lot of fun. I saw my cousins football game today. he did a good job. it is really funny watching little kids play sports. they do really funny things. COle is the quarterback.. so he got to play a lot.. and he is quite good. then we had a nice dinner.. and then I went to fort collins to see where dylan lives, works and hangs out.</description>
