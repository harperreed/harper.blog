      <description>in fact I really didn&amp;rsquo;t do much. I honestly barely made it to work. but on;y because I was so tired from working last night. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the deal was.. I was dieing. I drank soo much pop and candy - I think I surpassed the point of it being helpfuland it became a method of sedation. stupid sedation. I am sitll in love however with wireless internet. so before any asks.</description>
