      <description>it has been a weird couple days. It all started last wednesday. tommie called me to alert me of his presence and invite me to scissor sisters. that ruled. we hung out then. and then we went to crobar and I broke myself. i hadn&amp;rsquo;t been feeling good. so I stayed in bed friday. then went to my final interview around 5ish on friday. I receieved and accepted my offer and happily went to the paper magazine party at marshall fields.</description>
