      <description>after walking to work. I noticed that I generally feel pretty good - in regards to the stiffness and all the reasons I went to accupuncture. that seems pretty cool. on the elevator up to work there was a sign on the thirteenth floor that had a biohazard symbol and a birthday cake. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to read it - I was confused by the combination of those icons. maybe not so much confused as I was worried.</description>
