      <description>Tonight I went to see afriends fashion show. It was interesting. Quite something really. the first two collections were good. The models were very professional and the whole presentation was well thought out. The third collection was from the crisiswear, and I have seen it many times before.. it is ok.. not bad. .but not super appealing for me.. however.. my friend rachel was modeling for him so that was nice to see.</description>
