      <description>So i ride the bus a lot. Maybe 4 times a day. It is quite something. I spend most of that time waiting for the bus and being annoyed. But a small portion of that time is spent boarding various versions of the chicago cta bus. The one pictured on the right is the worst design i have ever seen for public transportation efficiency. Basically the user with the &amp;ldquo;fast RFID type card&amp;rdquo; enters the bus through the door and then waits for everyone else to put their card in the slot near the driver.</description>
