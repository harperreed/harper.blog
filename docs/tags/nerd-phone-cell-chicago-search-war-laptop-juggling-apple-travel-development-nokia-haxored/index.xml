      <description>so today - I am chilling - taking a shower and my wall attacked me. I was just brushing my teeth in the shower and I turned around and the wall that was facing my back lost all the tiles. It was nuts. I about died. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly imagine what had happened. honestly scared the hell out of me. I really love being scared. i leave for greality today. my brother is getting married on saturday.</description>
