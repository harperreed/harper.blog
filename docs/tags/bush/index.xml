      <description>Last night I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up going to bed util far far too late. It was a good time.. however.. I am going to be paying for it something fierce.. in a couple hours :( in good news.. it appears that Bush railed trent lott for being so stupid. That is good.. however.. bush did not say that lott is a problem.. just that he shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have said those things.. wtf.</description>
