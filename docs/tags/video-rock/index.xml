      <description>Today work is fun. well sorta. we got smoe good stuff done. but now I am ready to go home. Some friends and coworkers sent me some good links. Noel sent this gayness test in.. I am apparently 46% gay. wow surprise there huh ;) one of my coworkers sent this &amp;ldquo;Starship Dimensions&amp;rdquo; site to me. It is rather fun. Mostly because their are soooo many space ships.. This weekend made me(and my brother apparently) want a miniDV cam.</description>
