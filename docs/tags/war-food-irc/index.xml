      <description>so a club broke and many people died last night. My parents called at 7:30 to make sure I was alive. 7:30. that is so early. anyway.. I can totally imagine that happening in many of the clubs I have been in. they all have ONE entrance or exit and it is usually very small and around a lot of stairs. Friday I went to REDNO5 and their was a slight scuffle on the landing of one of the staircases and some people fell&amp;hellip; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine what would happen if everyone wanted to leave.</description>
