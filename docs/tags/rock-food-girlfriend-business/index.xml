      <description>i need to go get some food. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really gotten food at the grocery in at least three mmonths. I think that this is rediculous. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that is how you spell rediculous.. however I am not in the mood to look it up right now. I suppose I could just &amp;ldquo;program&amp;rdquo; my weblog to spell check itself.. but whatever.. I am not THAT bored currently. Tonight I had a big meeting with a &amp;ldquo;client&amp;rdquo; of mine.</description>
