      <description>Today I am tired. I went to bed before two.. which is usually a good plan&amp;hellip; but for some reason today is killng me. argh.. so tired. and my mail server broke. the /var logs are filling up. I think I may be under attack ;). I hope not. whateverHere is an interesting interview. This is a nice alternative viewpoint. Well not really alternative.. but different from what bush wants us to believe.</description>
