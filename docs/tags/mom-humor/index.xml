      <description>Once when I was little, I was playing with my jacobs ladder, when my arm got stuck in it. This burnt me real bad and made me a littl ebit sad. however, since that moment I have always enjoyed high voltage equipment. SO check out this for all your antigravity needs or this if you really want to have fun.In other news I was shown this site and I am not quite sure what to think.</description>
