      <description>So this weekend was erally great. So much nice stuff happened and went down.. but all because of a very sad reason.. Yesterday bec left for miami.. :( - hopefully we will see her again. I really enjoyed hanging out and getting to know her. I wish her the best of luck and hope to her from her soon.. however the saying goodbye part was soo sad. I hate being sad and goodbyes are the hardest part.</description>
