      <description>Well. I go home today. I am excited. I love sleeping in my own bed. so nice. and it will be the first time in awhile. Last night I exported my IPOD music db to a comma delimited file and imported it into endeca(the search engine I am at training for). This was a fun exercise - it showed me a bunch of neat things&amp;hellip; like how much music I have ;) You can really get a nifty view of your data when you look at it with good tools.</description>
