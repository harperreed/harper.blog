      <description>i have been away. oh yes. I have been away. i got to buffalo on wednesday night. dylan arrived shortly after I did and we went to the renegade show at this really awesome space called sphere. The renegade show was pretty awesome - mark faje was really funny as the MC and really made the renegade show what it is &amp;ldquo;supposed to be.&amp;rdquo; so then we went to our hotel - where we expected to be greated by a multiple room suite - only to find a one room one bed space for 6 men.</description>
