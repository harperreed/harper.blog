      <description>On saturday - my mom, dad and hiromi all went to the hobby shop to look for hobbies for my father. he didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything so I later went back and got him a 130 in 1 electronic experimentation kit and a fancy radio control car kit. Hopefully he won&amp;rsquo;t be bored. Then we all went ice skating.. well we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually go ice skating - we went to an figure skating show.</description>
