    <p>heh. yea so my friends have &ldquo;caught&rdquo; me. busted for sure:
<blockquote><small></p>

<p><b>[@vanwinkle]</b> is harper giving up blogging?<br/>
<b>[clock]</b> yeah I think so its been forever<br/>
<b>[@vanwinkle]</b> whatever happened to three post per day minumum?<br/>
<b>[@scottv]</b> he got a job
</small></blockquote>
So basically I have been just chilling out hard. not doig anything. I get home and I don&rsquo;t play computer or anything. I really should. I have so many projected that I should finish. they would be easy. and I could make some quick cache. but oh no. I just sit around. and read. I think that is all I have done in my house the last couple months. that and play video games. I lead the life of a philosophy student/<a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&amp;img=high_times.jpg">stoner</a>. except I don&rsquo;t <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2FIncoming&amp;img=fires-colo062002.jpg">smoke</a>. heh. and I am not lame. oh wait. ummm. yea.
<br/><br/>hmmm lets see. the last time I updated my blog was in 1983. what has happened since. well I graduated elementry school and moved on to middle school. I saw david bowie. umm. what else. <br/><br/>i need a mirror so I can see when people are entering my cube. it is killing me. I keep &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; movement and it is destroying my life. I keep snapping my head around and I am starting to get a neck ache. ;) <br/><br/>anyway. a bunch of fun stuff has happened since I last posted. nata2.info stills pulls a BUNCH of bandwidth. as of today it has pulled about <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&client=firefox-a&q=725266224+kilobytes+to+gigabytes&btnG=Search">
691.66777 gigabytes</a> in october. wtf. that is 2350920 hits and 249529 pageviews. roughly 39057 visits. heh. that rules. I have conceptually had my entire home town visit my website. almost. well not really at all. but a town of almost 39k. hah. stupid numbers. also on the popular site front - the falaphilia site peaked with 24353 visits in one day and has dropped to less than 150 in a week. We were mentioned on numerous news sites and got quite a bit of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=falaphilia&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">blog coverage</a>. it was pretty nuts. I like it when the internet is awesome. <br/><br/>i wonder what will be next. I got some ideas. but I need something to help me execute them. possibly time. haha. that is why we just subscribed to direct tv. I am going legit. I did however hack the shit out of my tivo. so now I get all the fancy backdoors and such - but I am a legit subscriber (of both tivo and dtv - wtf).   It was pretty fun to do. I didn&rsquo;t have to do any of the hard stuff. the <a href="http://dopeman.org/directivo">directivo scene</a> has everything pretty solid. the hacks I applied are as follows: upgraded my drive to 160gb (120 usable), upgraded the OS to 4.0whatever (found on emule w00t - supports wireless internet updating and such native), enabled telnet, tivoweb, ftp, mfs_ftp, tytools and all that jazz, unscrambled the recordings and applied a couple misc hacks for good measure(perm 30 sec skip). It is a nice device now (whereas before it sucked??). I can&rsquo;t wait until I get the streaming from the tivo working. I will be able to watch my shows from my computer - while matt or matiss are playing video games. after times like this I remember how awesome I am. haha. I rule.</p>

<p><br/><br/>so I have been trying to take it easy as and save money as well as go out and spend money. it is a worthless endeavor. basically I just go out and then feel guilty about it later. it is a lot of fun however. just not aligned with my goals. hah. <br/><br/>this weekend was pretty cool and fun. friday was weird. we hung out - it was scottv&rsquo;s bday. we just chilled. stopped by the lumpen select closer. didn&rsquo;t see any of my friends. left. went to soundbar. it was pretty good. slept. woke up. installed direct tv. tipped the installer. he about died. I think he said thank you 1 billion times. <br/><br/>this reminds me of my new personal goal: to engage in justaposition and hyperbole from now on. yea. I will do it. <br/><br/>
so saturday - we went to see suzanne and co at Y bar. but the doors were closed so we waited outside until amjad and friends shoed up for some soundbar action. we <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A10%3A24_Amjad_in_chicago/IMG_2063.jpg">hung</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A10%3A24_Amjad_in_chicago/IMG_2062.jpg">out a bit</a>. then we went to crobar. where it was madness. Hiromi and I ended up riding the train home at 6:30am. hah. rule. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Amjad_in_chicago">here are the pictures</a>. then last night, <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside&img=IMG_2204.jpg">matiss</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside&img=IMG_2119.jpg">I</a>, <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside&img=IMG_2122.jpg">juggled</a> at a film fest for rusty nails. it ruled. I got real real tired. we made zombie clothes by cutting up old clothes - then taking them outside and <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/251020041248/Nokia6600(728).jpg">burning them</a>. it was awesome. the show went really good. check out the pictures <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A24_Halloween_Movieside">here</a>. <br/><br/>i am now going to get my vote on. my absentee vote. cuz my work is sending me to salt lake city for training. it will be pretty  interesting. I have never been there - and I imagine that it is pretty crazy. crazy like a church. I will have to bring a couple books. what is crazy is my life starting on friday. first I leave for nyc to hang with some friends. I am really excited. then I have crazy parties. then I fly from nyc to cincinnati at 6am, then from cincinnati to salt lake at 8:40am. haha. keep in mind that I am going to a halloween party on sunday that will go until late. hah. I am screwed. luckily I have a cross country flight and won&rsquo;t be in meetings until the afternoon session. I will also be able to catch up on my rest. w00t. <br/><br/>my friend angus lent me his newton pda.  I am pretty excited. I am going to review it and post my findings on <a href="http://3gcoding.com/">3gcoding</a>. I want a miniture phone. give me one.</p>
