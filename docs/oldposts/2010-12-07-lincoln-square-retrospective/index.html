  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>I meant to post this months ago. hah. For some reason, it didn&rsquo;t quite make it live. Then a couple days ago, I was talking to a friend about his recent move to Lincoln Square. We spent some time talking about great places to go eat and hang out, and I remembered this post. I thought I would get it up and out there.</p>

<p>A couple months ago, Hiromi and I moved from Lincoln Square to Wicker Park. We had wanted to live in Wicker Park for many years and since we have nothing keeping us in Lincoln Square - we decided to go ahead and move.</p>

<p>Lincoln Square was awesome.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed living there for the 3 years we were there. The neighborhood was awesome. The people were great. The nightlife was&hellip; well, there was a bunch of great restaurants. ;)</p>

<p>I wanted to take a minute to chronicle the places we went to a bunch and the places we liked. Hopefully this list will helpful to someone. These are all the places I will miss.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jurysrestaurant.com/">Jury’s</a> - This place is insane. It has great hamburgers, great food and great service. It also has one of the strangest crowds in Lincoln Square. Always makes me chuckle.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.drewseatery.com/">Drew’s Eatery</a> - I like drew. He is nice. His eatery is a great place to get an afternoon snack or quick dinner. Very vegan friendly. This is key. They have Italian beef sandwiches. It isn’t often you can go to a vegan friendly place and order an Italian beef sandwich. I enjoy their water in a box.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theglobepub.com/">The Globe</a> - I think i went here 500 times for lunch with the SkinnyTech crew. It is a good place to watch people, football, rugby or have cheese fries.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cafe28.org/">Cafe28</a> - I love cafe 28. I suggest you go there immediately.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adeliciousvegancafe.com/">Delicious Cafe</a> - another vegan friendly place in the area. They have great vegan sandwiches and sweets. They often host dinners and other special vegan events.
*<a href="http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-leland-ave/2308/-rosded-restaurant?gl=us">Rosded</a> - This is my favorite Thai place. It is cheap, good and small - as all thai places should be.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.costellosandwich.com/">Costellos</a> - makes good sandwiches. We often walked there on an afternoon. It is always packed with families.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.halfacrebeer.com/">Half Acre Brewery</a> - a recent addition to the neighborhood. It is a great way to grab a growler for a party or BYOB place.
*<a href="http://maps.google.com/places/us/il/chicago/w-montrose-ave/2030/-mythos-restaurant?hl=en&amp;gl=us">Mythos</a> - Mythos is insane. I love every bit of it. If you are a fan of Greek foods and like BYOB then this place is for you. Mix it with some wine or the aforementioned Half Acre growler.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.glennsdiner.com/">Glenn’s</a> - I think this is one of my favorite places in Lincoln Square. It is hilariously packed. Make a reservation.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.merzapothecary.com/">Mertz</a> - this is for hiromi and hippies. They have nice soap.</li>
<li><a href="http://store.hazelchicago.com/">Hazel</a> - A nice gift store/nick nack store. A great place for picking up gifts or party favors. I recommend it. We got many good items here. The people are always nice and they do gift wrapping.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.firstslice.org/">First Slice cafe</a> - another great lunch spot. Out of the way. tasty and nice.</li>
<li><a href="http://chosunokrestaurant.com/">Cho Sun Ok</a> - The insane people who went here took ALL of our parking spots, always. But for good reason. this is a great korean place.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/movies?hl=en&amp;near=Chicago&amp;dq=davis+theatre&amp;theater=davis">Davis Theatre</a> - It is like a grindhouse theatre mixed with yuppies. A great place to see a cheap movie.</li>
</ul>

<p>I imagine I missed a bunch of great places. If you have any favs, leave them in the comments.</p>

<p>I really like Lincoln Square. I think we would live there again.</p>
