  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>Watch this <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xa3ud_limage-parfaite">french commercial.</a> I found it rather nice. In a sad sort of way. I like stuff like this. </p> <p>The last couple nights, I have watched the <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/">lord the rings trilogy</a>. It is pretty awesome. I love it. I bought all the movies when they came out and had watched them sporadically after I owned them. But it is nice to sit and watch them in close proximity to the last one. </p> <p>I am scared of reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=count+of+monte+cristo%20&amp;spell=1&amp;oi=spell">count of monte cristo</a>. It seems as though it will be a rough book. I hope it is really awesome. It is gigantic. Seriously the biggest book ever. I think that I will need a bigger bag to carry it to work. hah. </p> <p>I am seriously considering building out a <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">mythTV pvr</a>. It seems to be awesome. I really want to use <a href="http://torrentocracy.com/blog/">torrentocracy</a> to download TV shows easily and watch them on my TV. It will be awesome. The only worry I have is that it would grow to be very expensive. I don't want to spend a lot of money. I mean&nbsp; - I would love to have a DVD jukebox and to be able to watch videos and such I download from youtube on my TV. But I don't want to spend more than a couple hundred dollars - at the most. I really would like to use the hardware I currently have. Which I think I could use. I have an old hauppauge card and a desktop box that isn't doing anything. I could get a new case and drop it in there. Or I could wait until the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/12/hands-on-with-the-apple-itv-prototype/">ITV from apple</a> comes out and use that. But I might not be able to watch democracy downloads that way. </p> <p>Hmm. the choices. </p> <p>In other sad news - my N70 may have died. Which means I will have to use the E61, which I love, but it has no camera. and I love taking pictures. hmm. I wonder.... </p>
