<p>i need to go home. i have been at work since 12. almost 17 hours. that is messed up.</p>

<p>lakshmi has posted an <a href="http://lakshvivek.blogspot.com/2005/10/squidoo-lens-or-mirage.html">interesting take on squidoo</a>. I think the hype machine that is in full motion right now is pretty fun to watch. its amazing that seth is able to pull off what ad agencies woudl give a million dollars for. he just flexes and the long tail shakes. hah. seriously though - when i was at C-K, they would have killed for the reaction that seth is getting from his ebook and blog. It is demonstrative of how mis-udnerstood the internet culture is to most marketeers. Seth has it down pat - lets just see if the internet agrees with his vision of net-simplicty. I know that i agree, but the real test will be to see if my mother agrees.</p>

<p>i have to be honest that i am bummed i haven&rsquo;t received my beta invitation yet. i want to see how it turned out. the sample screenshots are nice - but i want to see how the lens maker turned out and all that fancy stuff we talked about.</p>

<p>At work we are going to start podcasting. it is going to be awesome. Charlie and I will be the voice of threadless and 15megsoffame. W00t. Stay tuned. and if you must - check out my <a href="http://odeo.com/channel/31095/view">old trainwreck podcasts</a> on odeo.</p>

<p>I am really excited for my amp parts to start coming tomorrow. I really don&rsquo;t know about the enclosure - but i suppose i will live. i did have quite a shock last night researching speakers - my old favorite speakers are only worth about 40 dollars for a pair. people are enjoying them still but they are not expensive. so i have been looking for some ultra high efficiency speakers and i think i am leaning toward some from the triangle line. They seem to be making pretty awesome desktop speakers for around $500.  excitment.</p>

<p>all my friends are getting married and i am pissed. haha. i am excited and will have fun. but i hate having to go places with no money. stupid aggressively paying of bills. someday. i will be rich and can fly to des moines on a moments notice.  or maybe derek will move here.</p>
