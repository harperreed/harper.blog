    <p><a title="get showtimes in your area" href="http://www.google.com/movies?mid=e8dd2e2233739e7b"><img height="156" alt="Children of Men" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/137/351412740_3b99dd954b_m.jpg" width="240" align="right"></a>So tonight May convinced me to go see <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0206634/">Children of Men</a> with a friend of hers. It was quite something. I really enjoyed it. It was relay sad and harrowing, however was completely brilliant. I went in to the movie with no expectations and had no idea what it was about nor what the idea or political message behind the movie was. </p> <p>It made me think. </p> <p>I haven't thought during a movie in a long time. The story is basically:</p> <blockquote> <p>In 2027, in a chaotic world in which humans can no longer procreate, a former activist agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea, where her child's birth may help scientists save the future of humankind.</p></blockquote> <p>However what is in the movie is quite different. I mean, that story is there. But the imagery of refugee containment camps, horrible activists and evil rioters really helped to set the stage for what will happen to US if we don't all change. It was&nbsp; really quite something. It made me wish the world was a better place. </p> <p>The feel of the movie reminded me a bit of the short by <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0088955/">Neill Blomkamp</a>, called <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837&amp;q=alien+south+africa">Alive in Joburg</a>, which is about Aliens landing and being refugees in South Africa. Sad. Good soundtrack. Reality. But the future and not real. Yet. </p> <p>The Children of Men movie&nbsp;itself was quite entertaining. A lot of amazing futurisms, great scenery, decent acting and a good story. Plus it was super action. A lot of gore - but not that relay annoying gore that is in a lot of movies now a days. It was that scary gore - where you look away because you think it might be realistic. </p> <p>I hope the future isn't like that.</p> <p>Here is some more information about the movie: Rotten tomatoes has <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/children_of_men/">it at 92%</a>.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.bigempire.com/filthy/childrenofmen.html">Here is a decent review</a> and <a href="http://movieeveryday.blogspot.com/2007/01/children-of-men-2006.html">another</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the IMDB listing.&nbsp;And if you&nbsp;are unable to see it in the theatre (over seas, a bad person, bored, poor or whatever reason) you can&nbsp;<a href="http://www.veoh.com/videos/v200034pMsdH7ht">watch it online here</a>.&nbsp; You can go to Google to get <a href="http://www.google.com/movies?mid=e8dd2e2233739e7b">showtimes in your area</a>.</p>
