    <p>seriously I do. my new goal (well it is the same as my old goal - but with a bit more randomness) is awkwardness, juxtoposition and hyperbole. so basiclaly my life. hah. but I am excited. for the next couple days. work is becoming ultra cool. I think their will be some nice changes soon. it just seems like their will be. like the wind is blowing change my way. I do think it is funny - I could be the veritable harbinger of death and sorrow for developers - for I have never worked anywhere where as soon as I get hired the lead developer doesn&rsquo;t quit. I think that is weird. maybe they just catch &ldquo;wind&rdquo; of my skillz. haha. whatever. anyway. regardless of my nonsense words. I am pretty excited about work. I want to do more faster. <Br><br/>so after work there is going to be fun too. mike and my friend <a href=" http://www.livejournal.com/users/caerrie/">carrie</a> are driving up from greality to come see the pixies tomorrow night. they will arrive tonight. the fun thing is - mike nor me have ever really met carrie. I have talked to her briefly while sleeping and chatted with her a number of times. I have followed her blog for awhile but yea. it is going to be awesome. or really weird and awkward. I vote for awesome. I am excited. EXCITED. hah. anyway. this brings me to the pixies. soooo. the pixies were incredible. I was very very happy to see them on saturday. they played an incredible set. all the songs I wanted to hear (except alec eifel). and they were just generally thrilling to see. kim deal was so nice. they did not talk a lot. really it was awesome. or it was awesome, really. <br/><br/>i am going to retire soon. to bed. I need to do work. now!</p>
