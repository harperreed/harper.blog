    <p>and sleep deprevation is destroying my ADD.</p>

<p>I really feel that ADD helps me work on all my projects. For instance today: I worked on extratasty for 3 hours, I played with the stompbox and the verizon card for 3 hours and I did &ldquo;research&rdquo; on some other projects (jacobs sync hah) for awhile. But - it wasn&rsquo;t really in blocks like that - it was threaded. So everything was happening at once.</p>

<p>I do think that this can get confusing and can lead to not being very productive - i just have to make sure that i am on track with everything.</p>

<p>hah.</p>

<p>whew. i am really sleepy. and i am watching really weird TV. I just watched will and grace, some other show which i forgot, two episodes of the golden girls and now the nanny. Rather than sit through fran drescher, i am going to go to bed. eep.</p>

<p>my house is incredibly lonely right now. Ever since all my roommates moved out - its just me and the remenents of matiss. Quite weird. i spend almost every night by myself hanging out with my laptop and TV. The only thing that sucks is that i don&rsquo;t have the motivation to really make my place look better or be cleaner - but i get annoyed by the mess. eeek. i need some roommates stat. or i need to move. but i HATE moving. HATE IT.</p>

<p>I am really excited for japan in march. Today is hiromi&rsquo;s birthday. Stupid japan being so far. It would have been nice to be around her for her birthday. but yea can&rsquo;t win then all.</p>

<p>Tonight, however, i learned how to use pulse wave modulation while programming BASIC STAMPS. heh. it was fun. i made my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/102881174/">LEDs fade in and fade out</a>. I am preparing for my gumstix. I am planning on making a bluetooth aware led light with some audio to interact with me and my environment. It is pretty exciting. I am worried that i am about to submerge my head about 2 feet under water. trouble. but at least i will get ambient led light part to work.</p>

<p>awesome</p>
