      <title>The future as told by books</title>

      <description>I read a lot of books. I read because it inspires me and shows me paths that I could never imagine. Sometimes those paths are horrible and sad and sometimes they are hopeful and amazing. Not always are they paths to the future and sometimes the paths are actually about the past, but make sense when applied to the future. Books are amazing.
The other day I was thinking about books that have inspired me to think about the future critically.</description>

      <description>###Preface
I have been following The Setup for quite awhile. I love learning about the how, why and what of getting things done. The Setup does such a great job of shifting the dialog to the objects that are behind the action.
So, as a long time reader, I was stoked when Daniel (aka waferbaby) reached out and asked if I would like to do an interview.
Although I have included it here, please check it out on The Setup.</description>

      <description>It has been about nine months since I last posted on this blog. I promise I haven&amp;rsquo;t completely forgotten about it. I am so busy that when I have a quick second to think about posting - I am suddenly thinking about the next thing and the thoughts about my blog have disappeared.
I am busy because of the awesome work I am doing with all the amazing people at Obama for America.</description>

      <description>I am constantly telling my friends about the new technology tricks that I learn in my internet travels. I learn a lot, which has caused my friends to ignore around 90% of what I say about technology. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind, because I know that I am a genius(heh) and they will come around some day.
This is exactly what happened with my most recent hacked upon hosting setup. I told my buddy kanno, and he didn&amp;rsquo;t pay attention.</description>

      <description>2010 was a great year. I rarely write these retrospectives (only 2008 I think), but i think about writing them every year. It is so cheesey, but also a fun exercise in memory and retrospection.
So.. here goes.
2010 was a great year. I spent a bunch of time helping startups, hanging out with friends, spending time with Hiromi, traveling and enjoying life.

I spent most of 2010 doing my best to avoid deliverables and enjoy not having a day to day job.</description>

      <description>I meant to post this months ago. hah. For some reason, it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite make it live. Then a couple days ago, I was talking to a friend about his recent move to Lincoln Square. We spent some time talking about great places to go eat and hang out, and I remembered this post. I thought I would get it up and out there.
A couple months ago, Hiromi and I moved from Lincoln Square to Wicker Park.</description>

      <description>On October 28th, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Tech Cocktail Startup Mixology Conference. It was a fun quick conference with a set of amazing speakers.
Below is my talk. I spoke about fostering a community of problem solvers. Here are my slides.

Would love to know your thoughts.
I am excited to see Tech Cocktail grow. I have been going to TC for years now. Threadless sponsored the first TC in boulder, we had tables at various TC&amp;rsquo;s in Chicago.</description>

      <description>Back in 2008 I hacked an unofficial api together from the exposed endpoints of the CTA’s bustracker application. This spawned a bunch of CTA applications in the iOS app store, the android app store and created a really neat ecosystem of CTA hackers.
For awhile, nobody but us transit nerds paid attention to this api/hack. However, as more and more apps were built and more and more people used those apps - more people started noticing the benefits from the opening of this “api.</description>

      <description>I am excited to be a part of Venture Hacks helping them find amazing startups for the Angels on the Angellist. The scout program is going to be a lot of fun and hopefully will allow some great startups to be funded by the amazing angels from the angel list. Check out this great write up in GigaOm.
If you have a startup that you want to submit to the angellist, you can do so yourself by submitting directly to the angel list.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like to move my blog around. It is super annoying. The RSS feed gets all messed up, I spend months tweaking everything. I find silly bugs and then fascinate about fixing them. All in all it takes months to complete the process. I avoid it like the plague.
However, I really wanted something simpler than wordpress. I didn’t need a CMS. I barely need a blogging engine. I update so infrequently.</description>

      <description>I was tricked by the gravitational forces that an apple product announcement causes into visiting the apple store. Five hundred bucks later I walked out of the apple store with a fancy new iPad. Excited and Doh!
The iPad is a new and very exciting paradigm for computing. I played with it afternoon and it felt very minority report. It felt like the future. no physical keyboard. I was controlling things with my finger/mind.</description>

      <description>I wrote most of this entry the day before the earthquake in Haiti. It was motivated by the magicJack announcement and my interest in mobile devices within developing nations. However, the thoughts in this post suddenly seemed more real after I started hearing reports of communication breakdown after the earthquake. The femtocell
At the recent CES, the magicJack company announced that they wanted to release a consumer grade FemtoCell device as an upgrade to their USB FXO/Softphone device.</description>

      <description>I love mobile phones. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why - but mobile devices represent so much of what I love about technology. The ubiquity, the fascination, all the new technology that pops up and all the different way people use their devices. I also feel like mobile devices will be the future of whatever the internet turns out to be. They will power the internet. With all this in mind - I have started to become interested in the devices that fill the opposite niche.</description>

      <description>2009 was an awesome year. A lot of amazing things happened in the world of hosting (and a lot happened in the world of Harper too). Being a crazy hosting aficionado, I will summarize my thoughts on hosting in 2009 (I will leave the predictions for 2010). Disclaimer: I am paid money by Rackspace to think about these things. However, I am an equal opportunity hosting consumer. I will try and be as open as possible (but probably a bit biased as well).</description>

      <description>I am leaving Threadless after 4 awesome years.
It was super hard to leave a job that taught me so much, helped me grow and was staffed by all of my friends, but I needed to make that leap towards the future. (Here is a nice interview covering all sorts of aspects of my leaving.)
I did it, and the future is looking bright.
In the next few months, I am going to be helping Rackspace in their cloud computing division.</description>

      <description>First things first: The Kindle is awesome
I read a lot. I am not like those crazy people who read a book a day or anything, but i have been reading up to about 2 books a week for the past few years. They are not crazy books, mostly science fiction and fantasy, but they are not small books. I read to chill out. My day pattern is to go to work, work, get home, nap, hang out with hiromi, play computer and then read until i fall alseep.</description>

      <description>I built Excla.im quite awhile ago, well before Twitter unleased their oauth beta program. Regardless, Chris Messina tagged the Excla.im sign up process as an anty pattern within his flickr stream. I was bummed because i would have loved to use Oauth to authenticate Excla.im. But because of the tagging, i was constantly thinking about how to remove the anti pattern.
Finally, Twitter released the Oauth Beta and I was able to bribe @Al3x to give me access (which reminds me, i need to send my bribe).</description>

      <description>I was tagged by both Eli White and Brian Fling in this dastardly meme regarding 7 things. I am usually a HUGE fan of all things meme - and kind of regard myself as a certified meme expert. However this whole meme that requires a lot of work - I.E. blogging is something entirely different. I think i actually like it, but i am not entirely sure yet ;).
I do find it hilarious that almost every blog post regarding this seven things starts with a bit of self deprecation and surprise at how this meme stumbled upon innocent them.</description>

A lot of fun things happened. I started speaking more. I started using linux as my desktop. Obama won. I played with XMPP manically. I built some neat applications and Threadless continued to be awesome.
On my blog, the following entires got a decent amount of attention:  Chicago Transit API - Oct. 6th - Reverse engineered and built a proxy for the CTA Bustracker. Mini Hi Fi: The Chase - Aug.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone.
I have been busy. Threadless just ended its annual holiday sale (went out with a bang). Hiromi and I have been busy getting read for our holiday party with my parents on christmas (today!) and i have been hacking on a bunch of stuff in my spare time. Hiromi made an amazing dinner and we ate it. ;) It was a great time. We missed Dylan and Sarah, but we will hopefully see them soon.</description>

      <description>I have been working hard to release the work that I have been doing to expose some of the more interesting real time data about chicago transit. Currently it is very bus-centric, but that is hopefully changing.
The genesis for this API is some work I did awhile ago reverse engineering the CTA Bus Tracker mashup. I was able to expose the endpoints that powered their google maps mashup. In its original state - you can get some pretty awesome functionality and data.</description>

      <description>I have recently been involved in talking to a local chicago entity about their unofficial API. It has been fun and deserves a blog entry of its own. However, this is not that blog entry - this blog entry is about mashups and the not so public APIs they often create.
In the past couple years i have constantly been tearing apart webapps. Either because I wearing my developer hat at work or because i am rocking on something at home.</description>

It all started a couple years ago when the SI Tripath Amp emerged on the market. It was a little amp that was reviewed as being MUCH bigger than its cost or its physical size. It was about 40 bucks at target and reviewed the same as amps costing thousands more.</description>

      <description>I use twitter quite a bit. I like to post to twitter in the most unobtrusive way possible. I don&amp;rsquo;t like to interupt my workflow to post a quick thought or update. When they used to have their Jabber bot running - it was easy for me to just type in my update and get on with my gmail session or work. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to load a page that was often down, or use some other tool.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago, I was in japan for some family events. It was a great trip. Hanging out with Hiromi&amp;rsquo;s family and friends was awesome. Since we were going to be spending some free time in Tokyo, i decided to reach out to the Tokyo tech community and meet some people.Â I emailed my friend, Kristin, who had just been to Japan and asked her to hook me up with some cool cats in the tech scene.</description>

      <description>Apparently for the last month or two, I totally forgot that i have a blog. Instead of blogging, i have been hanging out with Hiromi, using twitter,traveling, programming and building things. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to include blogging into that mix.
I have a theory, that when my twitter usage goes up, my blogging goes down (I am not alone in this). I am a bit annoyed by this. My twitter posts don&amp;rsquo;t have as much reach as my blog posts.</description>

      <description>It all started years ago when i got a Nokia 6600. It was a dope phone and it really raised the bar for me in regards to my expectations for a smart phone. It was one of the first &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; symbian devices. In regards to today&amp;rsquo;s standards - it isn&amp;rsquo;t that great. But back then it rocked the house. I remember telling my friends &amp;ldquo;OMG. check it out. you can take movies!</description>

      <description>Barack Obama seems to have won the democratic nomination. After all the time and work we all put into his campaign, I am VERY happy to hear this news.
I am more happy that Hilary Clinton didn&amp;rsquo;t win. She was really hurting my insides me with all the negative campaigning. I did not like how attacky she got in the end. I hope that she is done being annoying.
Now is the time to start supporting the Barack Obama, and the democratic party to defeat John McCain in November.</description>

      <description>On Thursday the 29th, the TechCocktail Conference is happening at Layola. You should go, and while you are there, you should come check out Scottv and my talk on technology agnosticism. It should be delightful. For those of you that know me - the time slot is hilarious: 9:30 in the morning. Wth. I rarely have an interesting happening that early in the morning. I am usually sleeping.
Here is some generic info.</description>

      <description>The last few weeks have been a whirl wind of travel, emergencies and fun events. All of it has made my life a mess in regards to plans, knowing whats up and keeping track of where i am supposed to go and when. Out of necessity, I decided it might be fun to track where I have been and where I am going. To handle this I use various sites like Dopplr, TripIt and fireeagle to keep track of my travels.</description>

      <description>Man. It has been a long time since I really felt like blogging. Blogging is weird sometimes. I finds myself being VERY busy and not having the time nor energy to blog thoroughly, so i end up forfeiting an entry, when i could have easily whipped up a couple paragraphs describing whats going on. I instead find myself concentrating on twitter or something else. Its pretty cool - but not as important as my blog.</description>

      <description>The other weekend, Charlie and I, flew to the University of Arizona to speak at their Thinking Forward Leadership and Innovation in Marketing Conference. It was a cool experience. The people who were involved with the Conference are rather intelligent and they really blew my mind in regards to their thoughts on Threadless/social media/Internet communities. They have words that I have never used that they use to describe the things I do every day.</description>

I am always into meeting new people so I had dinner with Brian Dorsey. It was awesome. I was able to rant and rave about all my ideas, interests and whatnot with new and possibly interested. Brian immediately suggested that he introduce me to a friend of his who he thought I would enjoy talking to.</description>

      <description>I am finally recovered from my flash travel/party tour. Being shuttled around the country going to parties is a rough life - let me tell you. It was awesome. I met some great people and saw some really cool stuff. It was really cool how much overlap occurred between the boulder crowd and SXSW.
Startup people are fun.
I want to run down the events and how they turned out. The first was boulder.</description>

      <description>I spend WAY WAY too much time trying to figure out where and how to host my websites. I guess you could it a hobby. A really horrible and expensive hobby. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a great way to meet friends, enjoy life or honestly save money. However - it prepares me for the awesome ability to bitch about hosting and to write this blog entry.
A couple weeks ago, Mosso changed some stuff and got my buddy Derek and I got to talking about hosting options if Mosso doesn&amp;rsquo;t pan out.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: Not a moment after i posted this - i got a mosso mailing that explained an upgrade in the plan. I will leave the original number in because i still think my point is valid and because that is what new Mosso customers will be getting. Their update is just a quick fix to stop us from bitching. It isn&amp;rsquo;t solving the problem.
I have blogged about Mosso before. I have used them practically from their inception (well before they were cool.</description>

Gmail is far better than outlook for our organization and the other tools just help make things go smoothly.</description>

I am not sure exactly what the title of the article or the exact content - but I was interview about my views on the rails community as someone who left the community and moved on to other things. (I think - I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it - just heard that i was in it.)
My history with rails is a tumultuous one. I first played with rails pre 1.</description>

I was surrounded by great people who all believed in Obama and his movement. Quite inspiring. I worked on validating submitted volunteer information. it was tedious work. I went through about 4500 records, sorting and updating. My eyes were done with computers by the time I left.</description>

      <description>In the past week there were a couple of companies(tumblr and 37signals) who publically blamed Rackspace for the downtime of their sites (tumblr here and 37signals here, here) . In both cases the downtime wasn&amp;rsquo;t widespread and was limited to the individual sites. In both cases someone from the respective site blogged about how it was rackspaces fault they were down. It got me thinking&amp;hellip;
I don&amp;rsquo;t like how these companies are blaming their vendors when their sites are down.</description>

I decided that key was the stories the awesome story about each character and monster really added a lot of personalization to the various creatures.</description>

      <description>This is exciting. Obama is the first candidate I have ever donated money too. Hopefully this will enable his campaign to get enough traction to win on a national level. Hopefully it is Obama and Huckabee against each other. Because then we either get Obama - who is pretty awesome, or Huckabee who is an insane person. INSANE. So either the U.S. will be in a place to repair, or a place to engage in a Holy war with the world.</description>

I like not having to deal with Jesus during the holidays. Its nice to be able to supplant tradition with something new and totally different. Like going to Japan.
The plan thus far is to hang out in Tokyo for a couple days and then make our way to Yamanashi for a party on the 28th.</description>

      <description>Awhile ago i decided to switch to Linux on my laptop. It was awesome. I didn&amp;rsquo;t last however - a work emergency occurred and I spent more time getting the openvpn to work up and then getting the Cisco vpn to our servers going than solving the emergency problem. It was indicative that i should have eased into desktop Linux a bit more.
So I have with much sadness reinstalled windows on my primary laptop.</description>

I was able to meet up with trow and the hosted labs guys - so that was good. It is always fun to involve ourselves in these affinity events. This one was especially funny because it was at a good friends bar. So when we showed up - it was quite hilarious.</description>

      <description>Man. This really gets my goat.
I have always had an interest in accessibility of technology by people who are differently abled, but i usually concentrated on seniors and children. It never occurred to me the challenges that a deaf person would have interacting with mobile phones and all that (I mean - i was aware that such challenges existed, i just never interacted directly with someone who had experience). About 6-8 months ago i met this guy Brendan at a conference.</description>

I am scared. Hold me!
I am currently installing Ubuntu on my laptop. 7.04 didn&amp;rsquo;t boot on this guy - but 7.10 rocks pretty hard.</description>

It has been a long and lazy day today. Pretty awesome. We are about to head out to a party at our friend Jill&amp;rsquo;s house. it should be fun. There were so many options this year. Quite a few people offered to include us in their families thanksgiving - it was a hard decision. I just picked the first one. haha. (and hopefully the one with the best food - as the hosts are all chefs at various places around the city).</description>

      <description>For the first time in almost 7 years my servers are offline.
I just shut them down. It was pretty sad. They were good servers. They did a lot of traffic. They were slashdotted, dugg, reddited, and probably any other sited that was hot shit in the last 6 years.Â I installed them when my dedicated host died in early 2001. Originally I just shipped them a box, which they hooked up.</description>

      <description>I have been working at skinnyCorp for about 2.4 years. We have grown a lot in that time. It is really cool to think about. When I started, we had 3 servers, a lot of traffic and were selling quite a few shirts a day. Now, we are approaching 40 servers, a veritable ass load of traffic and we are selling a lot of shirts. It has been awesome to be a part of growing the technology behind Threadless in a pace that matches the community.</description>

      <description>Since Google just changed the game of mobile software - I got to thinking about my new fascination - Contact management. So the first place I go to is Gmail and Google&amp;rsquo;s new contact manager. Being an iSync freakout, I love syncing my contacts. I LOVE being able to bring in contacts from all my different sources and see them mix with my current contacts. I LOVE finding duplicates and merging then.</description>

      <description>Pretty insane. Oink has been raided and the owner has been arrested.
Oink was a really neat tracker. It was apparently fast, clean and super easy. Apparently it was the biggest private bittorrent tracker. Around 180k users. That is a lot of dedicated users.
It taught a bunch of people I know about bittorrent. It was used by anyone from joe smoe to actual musicians. It was a huge music community.</description>

      <description>Awhile ago I got this email from a friend. It is about the Medical Marijuana problem with Iraq veterans. I thought you guys might like to read it. So here it is: I just read the article you posted about medical marijuana and veterans and it definitely was intense. Its a shame that they are not getting taken care of. That particular guy says that there were no nightmares and his limbs were intact, which is very lucky.</description>

      <description>Today I found out that my dad was placed into the hospital to help him fight his infidel skin. Basically he has what is colloquially known as &amp;ldquo;extreme eczema,&amp;rdquo; but basically it seems that his skin is attempting to hijack his body and run it into a building. So with that in mind, he went to get himself checked out.
During his check out, the doctor was like &amp;ldquo;OMG. Yours skin is at terror alert red.</description>

      <description>Legally of course.
But everyday I am discovering new music and listening to interesting artists. The internet is awesome. I can&amp;rsquo;t really imagine what it would be like without it. I mean, I am able to think to myself &amp;ldquo;I would like to learn about classical music&amp;rdquo; and find a place that is offering an entire concert public domain.
it is great to see various modern artists like Trent Reznor and Radiohead abandoning Record labels and their past worlds and welcoming the new musical overlords.</description>

      <description>I just read this article. It is about an Iraq Veteran and his battle with post-traumatic stress. Pretty intense - but worth reading. You can check out the article here - even better, read the full version here. Its very well written and a solid read. I guess its pretty somber, but it seems to be truth. Man. The US is in&amp;nbsp;a weird weird place right now.</description>

      <description>I sit on IRC quite a lot. Most of the time in #corporate on efnet. I have been there pretty much everyday for the last 5 years. Kind of insane. I love shells. anyway, in the past couple months some friends and i were talking about starting another channel. So we brainstormed some channel names. Then i squatted in a couple of them to see what kind of people came in.</description>

      <description>I thought I would give a rundown of some&amp;nbsp;of the books I have been reading recently. In the last couple weeks, I have been interested in non-fiction reading.&amp;nbsp; I go through phases were I am suddenly really into books on different sociological issues. For instance, the hikikomori book I read awhile ago, and my fascination with any book that is about Chicago and Urban issues. So anyway - I will tell you what I have been reading and what I am in the middle of.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it has something to do with the motorcycle gas that runs in my blood (a lot of my relatives are &amp;ldquo;bikers&amp;rdquo;) or if it is my dream of looking and being like madmax. Whatever it is - I really like how the Sachs Madass looks. Today at lunch we were walking down Broadway and saw one locked up. It looks insane. It seems to be the melding of a custom scooter, a moped and a homemade motorcycle.</description>

      <description>I am not a fan of our current administration. I don&amp;rsquo;t like how they work, what they do or what they have done to our country. I haven&amp;rsquo;t voted them in. I have participated in removing them from office - without success. And now that it seems we are on the eve of an attack on Iran, i am not very happy. It is frustrating that a group of people are in power who are not listening to the world, not listening to their constituents and not listening to history.</description>

      <description>So the other weekend, Hiromi and I went to colorado to celebrate our marriage with our friends and family. It was fun. It was a party a year in the waiting. We had a ton of friends come and had some really nice parties at my parents house. Only a little bit of mayhem and pretty much an awesome time all around. It all started on Wednesday night. Hiromi and I flew to Denver.</description>

      <description>I am not a normal person (hahah). When I use my computer, I want to be around people. If Hiromi is in the living room, I want to hang out with her while I code or do whatever. But that often means sitting on the couch with my laptop. We have a pretty nice couch - nothing too fancy, but it is comfortable and good for sitting. But it makes you slouch.</description>

      <description>Last night, I started and finished Freakonomics. It was awesome and hilarious. I have been reading the freakonomics blog for a year or so - and I decided I finally needed to read the book. I enjoy Stephen&amp;nbsp;Levitt&amp;rsquo;s discussion of things that I never thought about. I especially liked the chapters about Chicago gangs. Sudhir Venkatesh was amazing. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what it was like to study and hang out with the Gangster Disciples.</description>

      <description>My Comcast cable Internet&amp;nbsp;has been out 4 times in the last 2 months. It is killing me. When speakeasy used to go out (very rarely), I would call them and they would fix it. I never had to have a technician come to my home and check out my DSL modem. But with Comcast, every problem - even when they admit that it is probably in the wiring leading to the house - they insist on sending a technician and wasting my time.</description>

      <description>It has been a week, and I am still reveling in how much fun we had. Lollapalooza has always been really fun. I have enjoyed going to the shows since I started in 92. There were a few rough spots here and there (I.e. after 98) but lollapalooza has turned out to be an amazing event. And its even more amazing that it is a HUGE event in Chicago. Awesome. It all started on Thursday night when Hiromi and I hung out with Derek and his family.</description>

He had linked to the photo pool that had a bundle of people following suit. It is amazing. I immediately took a picture of the things I carry around on me on a daily basis.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of fancy things.</description>

      <description>I thoroughly enjoyed the new Harry Potter. I just finished it. barely 24 hours after I bought it from borders(I had originally ordered it from amazon, but it was delayed by skinnyCorp being closed). I was a reading machine.
It was a good ending. Enough complexity to make things interesting. It was good. If you like harry potter - do not hesitate to read the book. Ok. Now I need to check my email and what not.</description>

We are all very different as well. Its really fun. I am always attempting to think of some activity to harness this energy and creativity. I&amp;nbsp;had this idea awhile back that I have been attempting to execute and I really want other to do it too - so I am going to share it here as an attempt to get it out and flush out some of the &amp;ldquo;rules.</description>

It is currently interfering with my typing - but I think that is my perception and not reality. I imagine I will soon get used to it and will forget that i ever thought it was weird. heh.

And generally drank more than we should have. Totally entertaining. I also hung out with my friend Atkins - who just moved to Chicago. exciting. Hope all your weekends were just as awesome. I have a couple more Pownce invites. I am not sure that i buy it as a great service, but if you want to check it out&amp;nbsp;- tell me a joke in the comments and I will send you an invite if its a good joke.</description>

      <description>I love jabber. I love Google talk because it is jabber. I really like what jabber supports and how it works. And the Google talk desktop app is pretty smooth. A couple weeks ago Google released Google talk gadget that allowed group chatting. This was super weird since the flash based gadget has totally blown the desktop app out of the water - in regards to features. What is annoying is that they are limiting the groups feature to Google talk accounts.</description>

Pretty nifty. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it is a replacement for a smartphone - but it certainly is swell. The maps and text application are both really nice. I like the text app better than the treo.</description>

Harper: [address redacted]

      <description>The other night i was somehow able to see Michael Moore&#39;s new movie: Sicko. It was amazing. Really sad and funny at the same time. It told me what i already knew - but added a bunch of person touches to it as well. One thing it mentioned that I didn&#39;t know - was that Cuba is a mecca for good medicine and is involved in bringing medicine to a lot of other third world countries.</description>

      <description>So. A neat thing happened to night. Crackers just tried to social engineer me out of a ftp passwd based on my whois record. Fun Fun. They called and told me that their had been an incident and they were resetting my ftp password for my server. The only issue was that their research was a bit off. But it was a interesting situation.
I wonder how much this happens. And i wonder if my server is for some reason under attack.</description>

      <description>I love Windows Live Writer. It makes blogging really easy. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about spelling, forming my links or the technical aspects of creating an entry. All I have to do is type in this app. and BAM. it works wonders. Anyway, they released a new version of Windows Live Writer. It has all sorts of neat new features (real time spell checking!!) and is pretty snappy. Check out&amp;nbsp; the release at the Windows Live writer page.</description>

      <description>Comcast is a bad person. I really hate them. On Wednesday, my internet died. So I call up and they tell me that they need to send a tech. So Friday I take off from work. The tech doesn&#39;t show. They claim he did show. long story short - I have no internet still. I am so mad. So anyway, hiromi and I have been stealing internet from neighbors and random cafes and what not.</description>

      <description>At skinnyCorp I have been trying to find a really solid wifi access point provider for awhile. Our needs are not that complicated - however we needed something that works. Originally we were using wifi to augment our wired network - before our cable pulling was completed. We used multiple Linksys WRT54G access points running DDWRT firmware using WDS. They allowed our network to spread&amp;nbsp;out to the warehouse and more importantly acted as a wireless bridge in the meantime of our network build out.</description>

      <title>Hosting woes. Collocation and how Mosso sucks</title>

      <description>I hate web hosting. I really do. I think that hosting is one of the most annoying parts of having web apps. It is hard to do. it is hard to manage. It is always more expensive that it needs to be. And it is constantly breaking in ways that severely damage whatever app is hosted on it. However, I have been lucky.
Since 2001, I have had boxes hosted in a collocation environment at OSU.</description>

      <description>Today I got access to the Google Mashup Editor. it is really nifty. I like it. The samples are amazing. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to sit down and play with it comprehensively. its really neat that the data is accessible with the gdata api.
I think that combining this and yahoo pipes could lead to interesting results. Making a language translating feed reader, or a yahoo local/Google base mashup. Combining the magic of feeds with the webapp magic of Google mashup editor.</description>

      <description>So I decided to jump in and write a facebook application. It was really fun and pretty easy. For those of you who haven&amp;rsquo;t been following this, Facebook released development kit for their site that allows third parties to develop applications that reside inside of facebook&amp;rsquo;s website. It is pretty nifty. So I used the framework I currently write software with. A mix of smarty and a solid DB abstraction layer, and modified it to work with facebook.</description>

      <description>So a couple weeks ago I found weewar and applied for an invite. Once I got in, I invited some friends. Then we fought our little wars. They were wee. Weewar is basically a turn based strategy game where you have little guy who have different roles. You attempt to capture your opponents bases and kill their men. I have never before gotten so many instant messages declaring &amp;ldquo;I am in your base, killing your dudes.</description>

      <description>When hiromi lived in Tokyo, she had this amazing service that delivered produce and whatnot&amp;nbsp;every week in the form of a somewhat blind box. It was great. She got awesome produce, fresh and magically. She didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a choice in what produce arrived, and was only guaranteed that it would be in season and locally grown.&amp;nbsp;
When visiting, and marveling at all things Japanese - I just attributed it to another interesting thing that japan has created.</description>

      <description>Awhile back I was lucky enough to get my hands on one of the beta XO-1 units of the OLPC. For those of you who are not familiar with the OLPC, it is a really neat hardware unit targeted towards developing cultures and societies. From Wikipedia:
 The XO-1, previously known as the $100 Laptop or Children&amp;rsquo;s Machine, is a proposed inexpensive laptop computer intended to be distributed to children around the world, especially to those in developing countries, to provide them with access to knowledge and modern forms of education.</description>

      <description>You know when you are speaking and you are have a word stuck in your head and you can&amp;rsquo;t quite think what it is. it is on the tip of your tongue&amp;nbsp;or whatever. Well for the past couple weeks, whenever someone mentions jabber, gtalk or xmpp or whenever I start thinking about those topics - I feel like I have some idea that is stuck in my head. Its killing me.</description>

      <description>I love weekends. They are great. I love not having the time off from work and being able to hang out with hiromi. But lately, because I have been so busy I have to use my weekend to do work. It blows. So today I am going to take off from work. and I am going to hack my chumby. and figure out some python tricks. I am excited. [tags]hacking, chumby[/tags]</description>

      <description>I really hate TicketMaster. Seriously. They are scamming people left and right. It is insane how much tickets are. Today - hiromi and I decided to go see Jon Stewart at the Rosemont Arena.&amp;nbsp;I jumped online and found that they were selling tickets at TicketMaster. I immediately was scared of how much they were going to be, but we really wanted to go. So I went through the process of ordering them.</description>

      <description>So I haven&amp;rsquo;t been updating as much as I should. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know why. I have a LOT to blog about. In the past month - I have met some really cool people, attempted to learn python better, got and hacked a bunch with an OLPC. visited and gave a interesting tech talk to Google, hosted a CHIPY meeting and went to the mysql conf in Santa Clara. These are all things that deserve at least one entry if not more than one.</description>

      <guid>http://harper.blog/oldposts/2007-05-06-which-laptop-should-i-get/</guid>
      <description>So I am in the market for a new laptop. I am currently using a Dell Inspiron 700M which I purchased a couple summers ago when I was doing freelance work. It has been a really good laptop and has gotten a lot of stuff done. So now that the customary 2 years has past, I am feeling the itch to upgrade to faster, cooler and much better machine.
My laptop is my primary computer.</description>

      <description>It all started today when DIGG censored a news story. A story about the AACS controversy. AACS issued some cease and desists to various organizations (I think including DIGG) who talked about cracking the AACS encryption on HDDVD and Blu-Ray DVDs.
So anyway - DIGG being a community based news site, the users rebelled and basically took over the site, posting similar news stories. Most with the evil evil key that is so coveted by the AACS.</description>

      <description>So Hiromi and I got a new car. A Nissan Versa. It is not a big car. It is tiny and has good safety ratings. Hiromi is currently driving it back from colorado. I am excited to see it. I am not sure but it may feature a continuously variable transmission. Which would be really neat. Regardless - it will not be a gas guzzler and will be small enough to park on city streets.</description>

      <description>This weekend was a lot of fun. It isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet, but it has been so full of activity and good things that it has ruled. So first off, Hiromi got a job. It is still about 5% tentative, but all she has to do is sign the contract and start. It is for a Japanese game company and I think it will fit hiromi well. She seemed to really like the people she interviewed with and she will get to use her management experience as well as Japanese.</description>

We got here a bit earlier today and have been waiting for our rooms to become ready. The weather is great - about the same as Chicago and I think it will only get better as we stay here.</description>

      <description>So I have been using twitter for a minute. I really enjoy it. I got all my friends on it and quite a number of my family using it. Its fun. I love getting updates and what not. However, the one thing I wish I could do with twitter is set the status of my various IM clients by sending a &amp;ldquo;tweet&amp;rdquo; to twitter. It would be awesome. You could then have your AIM status or Gtalk status show your latest twitter.</description>

      <description>This weekend was pretty fun. Hiromi and I hung out a bunch. We went and saw Grindhouse. it was entertaining. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like planet terror. I realized half way through that I really don&amp;rsquo;t like a lot of Rodriguez&amp;rsquo;s horror movies. I like Sin City and his none zombie movies. Not his zombie movies. However, Death proof was AMAZING. So awesome. Hiromi was not as sad about planet terror after watching those ladies kick some ass.</description>

However, my plan was spited by the opensource gods who delivered very little documentation about how to use the PECL Uploadprogress extension. So here is my quick writeup and example.</description>

      <description>I have a love and hate relationship with Ruby on Rails. I love what it does. I love the activerecord, I love how it makes designers and other non-software engineers into raving MVC lunatics. I really like coding in ruby and seeing how much work can get done by so little code. All of that is really exciting. However, I hate a lot about rails as well. I do not like that it is so slow.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Kurt Vonnegut, one of my favorite authors and a pillar my my upbringing, died. He was 84. I read my first Kurt Vonnegut book, Slapstick, &amp;nbsp;when I was in 5th grade. It was really amazing. I was quite a bit young for the book, but it was a great follow up to Catch-22. hah. I still remember Slapstick and think about it quite often. ~ hi ho ~ I think that is my Favorite Kurt Vonnegut book.</description>

      <description>So I got a Chumby awhile ago. It is really neat. I fell in love with it immediately. I took it apart, put it back together. I turned on SSH, poked around, played with the insides. I replaced images, replaced flash pieces and then I got real busy. So this weekend I finally got to sit down and get down to the nitty gritty. Well not so nitty gritty - but a bit nitty gritty.</description>

      <description>So awhile back, a little before etech, Kathy Sierra was attacked by some Internet hoodlums who used hatespeech and made Kathy Sierra feel threatened. She decided not to go to etech and instead posted a blog entry about how she was scared of life and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like going outside. I think her blog entry was good. It basically started a tidal wave of discussion about being mean and hateful on the Internet.</description>

      <description>I got tired of the old theme, so I sat down tonight and modified the heck out of the blogging pro theme to make it more my own. I like how it turned out. I think that there are still a few hacks and tweaks I will have to incorporate - but I like the feel. I still need to figure out if I want to add ads. I probably should, since my blog is growing a bit, but I just hate having ads&amp;nbsp; - so maybe I will concentrate on making my other sites make money.</description>

I hate it. I agree 100% with Matt Cutts about how wordpress has one of the most clunky and cruft creating upgrade process. So annoying. And it gets even more annoying when you are doing it with 50 blogs.</description>

      <description>Usually when I blog about Google, I am happy. but today it is a sad sad Google day. For the first time since the days of metacrawler, a search for Harper Reed doesn&amp;rsquo;t return one of my sites as the first hit. This really hurts. I guess I have been slacker at my SEO. Gotta jump back up there. I hope that harperreed.com drops once Google reindexes and notices that their title isn&amp;rsquo;t harper/reed anymore.</description>

      <description>It has been a minute since I have blogged regularly. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know why - but for some reason, I just haven&amp;rsquo;t felt like blogging. I think this happens when a lot of going on in my life. Recently I have been really slammed with various projects outside of work and have been doing really exciting stuff inside of work. Mostly tech stuff, but it is all very interesting and quite engaging.</description>

      <description>In the last year or so Threadless has grown insanely. When I started in 2005, we had around 2 servers and a bundle of downtime. Now, just a year and a half later we have an assload of servers and haven&amp;rsquo;t had any load based downtime in almost 6 months. Its awesome. We have really been striving to keep our server infrastructure two steps ahead of our traffic. It really makes a difference when we get slammed and our servers don&amp;rsquo;t even grown.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was pretty fun. It all started in the morning when I woke up and was able to wear the fancy new jeans Hiromi got me. Then I went to work and hung out. I just got my first memcached server and I got it running and hooked up to some of our code. It is really quite something. About 5-10 times faster than our current caching (but more on that later).</description>

      <description>My buddy Todd sent me a Frank Zappa interview and from that I ended up watching another, much longer, frank zappa interview. It is from the Dick Cavett show on June 12, 1980. Check out part one. Where Frank Zappa talks about the history of punk rock and how new wave is interesting. He also mentions how fashion is the driver toward music movements. Part two is about Frank Zappa&amp;rsquo;s interaction with the ADL about his song &amp;lsquo;Jewish Princess.</description>

      <description>So I have been sick for the last month. It is starting to get really tiring. I am bored of being sick. At first, I was like &amp;ldquo;oh awesome&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep and I have a stuffy nose, what a new experience.&amp;rdquo; But now I am totally over the new cold feeling and just want it to go away. I even went to the doctor which is something I am totally against doing.</description>

      <description>The other day, I decided to finish up a twitter hack idea I had and never fully executed. Awhile ago I made a bot that output the updates of my friends into my IRC channel. I did this by writing a quick bot that would log into a dedicated AIM account which received updates from the twitter service. Then the bot would output these updates to my IRC channel. This was neat.</description>

      <description>I started this post awhile ago. But with my brothers angry credit card company post and my angry student loan post, I think a post about how to easily manage ones finances is more topical than ever. So anyway&amp;hellip; My official&amp;nbsp; attempt to better manage my finances all started about 6 months ago when Hiromi and I first got married. With her away for most of that time - I was able to get things in a more working order than they were before.</description>

      <description>For the past couple weeks I have been slowly and surely reigning in all my finances and changing them to work with Hiromi and my new fancy joint account. Its pretty exciting and a big step for me in regards to finances. I usually manage my finances like I would a motorcycle - recklessly and without a helmet; but I have been trying to do everything the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; and have actually been reading blogs and what not to find out how to budget things efficiently and without losing money.</description>

      <description>This weekend my parents visited. It was really awesome. They haven&amp;rsquo;t visited since Hiromi moved back - and they really wanted to see her. So they stopped by for a quick trip and some excellent dining.
They got in Thursday night - so Hiromi and myself went downtown and visited them at the Hard Rock Hotel and had a nice quick drink. They stayed on the same floor (the Frank Zappa floor) and the exact same room as Hiromi and I - when we last stayed in the Hard Rock.</description>

      <description>So we got gocarts at work. It is pretty awesome. I grew up with gocarts - so driving fast around is second nature and great fun. Everyday I come in and Jake is driving around our space in the gocart - zooming around desks and generally having a great time. I am surprised someone hasn&amp;rsquo;t died. but yea.
here are some videos.
The first shows me and Jake driving the gocarts.</description>

 Top Sites  Yahoo! Microsoft Network Google YouTube Myspace Baidu.com Windows Live Orkut.com ??? Yahoo!???? 
 As you can see there are quite a few Google, yahoo and Microsoft controlled sites - with Myspace and qq being the only non federated sites in the top 10. This is interesting because it really outlines who actually runs the Internet.</description>

  Make sure that your ads blend into your site Place ads in a prominent place Make sure they are visible to all visitors (regardless of screen size) These have helped me quite a bit to bring my ad revenue up.</description>

      <description>I know I know. I have been a bad bad blogger. I basically I have been ignoring the fact that I have a blog. For a long time - - pretty much since I got back from japan at the beginning of January. eep. What weird is that I have been playing computer a lot - but mostly doing workish things. it made it hard to justify blogging when I had 100 things on my plate.</description>

      <description>So my blog has been slow for the past few months. It has been killing me. I run my own server - so I knew it was something that I did. However, I sadly thought that it was probably just the fact that I have a couple rather high bandwidth sites and only one server. I tried a lot of the &amp;ldquo;speed up wordpress&amp;rdquo; tricks and even installed and used wp-cache.</description>

      <description>So at lunch today we were talking about vegan food and I remembered this excellent vegan chocolate cake recipe that my family made for the holidays. It is so good. I remember when we had bunches of non-vegan cakes and pies - this one was always the first to get eaten (the majority of my family is not vegan). Soo good. Anyway - here is the recipe - straight from my mom: Chocolate Vegan Cake</description>

      <description>So Jake asked me about Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s new Windows Vista and whether we should look into getting it. So we looked at the website to see when it comes out and wtf - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say. hah. It totally says that the countdown starts now, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell me when the countdown ends. What a horrible website. Jake thought it was a spam site at first and only from it being at the domain Microsoft.</description>

I love reading about how my friends are doing and what is going on in their lives and with their friends. It is such a nifty way to stay in touch. I know from my own experience how rewarding blogging can be. How it can create connections with people who normally would never be connected.</description>

I am pretty excited to see how it goes. I played with it a second here at work - but yea know. watching television at work isn&amp;rsquo;t really the best way to get things done.</description>

      <description>So tonight May convinced me to go see Children of Men with a friend of hers. It was quite something. I really enjoyed it. It was relay sad and harrowing, however was completely brilliant. I went in to the movie with no expectations and had no idea what it was about nor what the idea or political message behind the movie was. It made me think. I haven&#39;t thought during a movie in a long time.</description>

I got back from Japan yesterday and didn&#39;t follow the rules for avoiding jet lag - mainly I went right to sleep and then stayed up all night hanging out. So I decided to stay up all day today as punishment. Then I will go to bed normally and wake up super early! hah. Anyway, while in my sleep deprived state I decided that it would be a good idea to play server and check out why my server was a bit slow lately.</description>

As you may or may not know, in Japan, New Years is quite big. It is a lot like a combination of Thanksgiving and Christmas. So while I was away for New Years, I had no access to the Internet. For almost 4 days. It was really neat.</description>

I picked one of my favorite movies, O Brother Where Art Thou, because I love it and I thought&amp;nbsp;my grandfather would enjoy it. He did. We all watched it and laughed a bunch. So then when I got home, I did a bunch of research on who the music was by and what not and found that most of the music from the movie is from the bluegrass band called The Stanley Brother.</description>

The insanity started at work around 4. The entire day had been insane, with a supposed real world appearance and our Internet going down, so when 4pm rolled around and everyone gathered around for secret Santa - everyone was pretty hyped up.

Just to make sure that the samples were good enough I sent them to my brother Dylan&amp;nbsp;and my Dad&amp;nbsp;to test out.&amp;nbsp;Since&amp;nbsp;I sent it to Dylan&#39;s house, his wife, Sarah&amp;nbsp;was lucky enough to actually receive the shipment and sent this email to Dylan:</description>

Like I said a couple posts ago, I have been thinking about writing a utility that will set your IM status based on your twitter update. It will be awesome. But in the meantime I whipped up a quick hack to help yall hook your twitter into your IRC application.</description>

      <description>Everyone at worked has been talking about Lost incessantly since I started working at skinnyCorp. It was driving me mad - mostly because they kept talking about all sorts or interesting things. Things that didn&#39;t make sense and it was completely infuriating. I was completely taken in, without even seeing or knowing anything about it. The final straw was the alternative reality game the Lost people put on. It was absolutely madness.</description>

      <title>Twapp - a quick hack to update and view twitter</title>

      <description>Tonight after work I decided to whip up a quick twitter client in C#. I love C#. It is so fun and easy. I have never done web work in it, but love writing applications. So tonight I just sat down and slugged through the idea.
You can check it out at: http://flashandburn.net/twapp
The idea behind the client is a small application that will sit in your taskbar and constantly update you on your friend timeline.</description>

      <description>So my grandfather is older. He isn&#39;t 1000, nor is he 150. But he is up there. Maybe around 75ish. But he is pretty spry and active. He is, in fact, the mayor of his town. So the other day when I was in Colorado - he mentioned how he was needing to get his emails up, how he needed to be able to get and receive his important mayoral emails.</description>

      <description>My brother and his wife are struck with a season of hard times. Its a bummer. He is a wonderfully happy person and I know they will get through this fine, but it seems that he is at that point&amp;nbsp;I think almost all of us have been at, where it seems like there is no end near. Where it seems like nobody is helping. And since its financial - it is hard to find help without sacrificing something yourself.</description>

      <description>After a really nice long week in Colorado I am sadly back in Chicago and back to work. We had a fun time. I got in two Fridays ago.
I arrived in Colorado the Friday before thanksgiving. My plane was arriving late - so my brother and his wife Sarah picked me up. We then drove to Burlington to meet up with my parents and relatives at my grandfathers house. We got to Burlington late so I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get a chance to hang out much - but I did get a chance to see my parents new dog ellie.</description>

      <description>So last night after watching movies with my parents and making capes with my mom, I decided to redo my code repository/misc directory site that was at nata2.info. I decided that I needed to make my code repository a bit more &#34;official&#34; - so I moved everything that was at nata2.info over to stuff.harperreed.org. Then&amp;nbsp;I rewrote the blorp script that was powering the repository using PHP and smarty. I used the Pear TEXT/Highlighter class to colorize the source code.</description>

      <description>So my name is harper. It isn&#39;t a very common name, so I have always had luck with being pretty high ranked in the results&amp;nbsp; when a person&amp;nbsp;searches for my full name &#34;harper reed,&#34; but when you search for my first name I am often beat out by such &#34;cultural giants&#34; as ben harper, harpers magazine, harper&#39;s bazaar, harper collins, harper college, harper the musician, and harper the movie. But recently my search rank for harper has grown.</description>

      <description>The OSX/Mac voip community has a new mailing list. It is located the The Macintosh Telephony Mailing List site. The list will cover all sorts of interesting voip/mac topics and won&#39;t be just a bunch of asterisk peeps talking about asterisk. It should have a bundle of information about turning a mac mini into a full featured PBX and what not. It will turn out to be a great place for Mac voip information and contacts.</description>

      <description>Dylan is driving me and Sarah to my grandfathers house, as I write this. its pretty funny that technology has brought us this far. I cant wait to see the future&amp;hellip; again. so traveling is fun. but flying is so damned annoying. the security checkpoints are really ineffective and just cause problems. seriously - what good is it doing to limit the number/size of the toiletry carry on. I mean wtf.</description>

      <description>I have been hosting blogs for my friends for quite awhile. Its a lot of fun. I love reading them and trying to get them to blog more. It is a neat way to learn about people and see what they have been up to without being constantly in touch. It is especially good for friends that are away or travel and all that. So I starting hosting peoples blogs using greymatter.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow is the 2006 General Election. You need to vote. It is very important. I think voting is very exciting. Even though I am sometimes bummed by the outcome - I love participating in our countries politics and influence policy. It rules. I have voted in every election since I was able to first vote in 1996. And it is still a little bit magic to get in line and do whatever you need to do to submit your vote.</description>

      <description>I was thinking about how I have a lot of domains that are not being used and how that pisses me off. It is annoying to have a domain that costs 12 bucks or whatever (stupid joker) and isn&amp;rsquo;t making money - when I could. And a lot of times I am not really mad about it not making money - just mad it isn&amp;rsquo;t being used. I wish I either had a lot of energy, money, or an extra arm to finish all the sites I want to.</description>

      <description>So. I love Wikipedia. I love encyclopedias. I love the knowledge and the ability to learn anything quickly. Wikipedia is special because it allows people to contribute their knowledge to the general content base. This is awesome. This alone is enough of a differentiation to make Wikipedia the choice for the new generation. But wtf can&#39;t they solve simple usability issues? Simple things even.. For instance. I was surfing Digg and I noticed an article about Cabrini-Green, the projects in Chicago.</description>

      <description>Ahh Halloween. How I love the city during Halloween. It is absolutely madness. This Halloween was quite a bit of fun. Not as crazy as last year - but more fun. On Friday skinnycorp had a nice Halloween party that I was responsible for. We had mark the knife perform and some really awesome costumes. The only bummer part was that I didn&#39;t get dinner and ended up getting rather drunk toward the end of the night.</description>

      <description>So for the last couple months skinnyCorp has been working on moving hosts. It has been pretty fun and interesting and there are a few things that we have been hesitating moving because it is such a pain in the ass. One of those things is email. Man, I hate email. I mean - I love writing it and getting it. But managing email servers could quite possibly be the most annoying things.</description>

      <description>So I sold my Nokia E61 to my friend Scott - he will probably use it more than I and he doesn&#39;t mind it not having a camera - and I used the money to pick up a Nokia N73. The Nokia N73 is a really nifty phone. It is a bit longer than my Nokia N70, but noticeably thinner and quite a bit lighter.&amp;nbsp; Like the N70 it feels really solid.</description>

      <description>So this evening/Japanese morning Hiromi had her final visa interview. Everything went great. She got her visa and now she can come to the US. It is awesome how smooth everything has been in regards to our government/embassy/visa experience. I really think the key is how prepared we were.&amp;nbsp; We spent a lot of time making sure that the forms and what not were filled out appropriately. It was pretty awesome.</description>

      <description>I realized a minute ago that I haven&#39;t looked at slashdot in a month. That is really screwed up. I have been looking at slashdot for years. truly since the beginning of slashdot. I remember when they added users (I think). It has always been around. However, I just haven&#39;t been going to the site.&amp;nbsp; I have been reading del.icio.us or digg instead. its more rounded. I am less interested in news for nerds and much more interested in news.</description>

      <description>Heath has a nice little exercise written up on his blog about marking up a magazine that you love with a sharpie and sending the resulting notes to the editor for their consideration. It is interesting because the idea is to interact with people who normally are in a one way world. The editors are creating something and rarely would receive comprehensive feedback such as the proposed writeup would create. Heath mentions that the writeup should be short and sweet, with three to five primary points.</description>

      <description>I have been reading this awesome book called Shutting out the Sun. It is by a Knight Ridder reporter who spent a lot of time in Japan and the surrounding area. I had originally heard about the book when I caught him speaking on NPR about the topic of the book - hikikomori. It struck me as a quite interesting phenomena and with the time recently that I have spent in japan - a rather topical book to read.</description>

It ruled.&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t have work on Friday. The Jakes gave us all the choice of taking off Friday or Monday - because we all worked for such a long run while moving. I decided to take Friday off to prepare for our &#34;juggling show&#34; at the Lumpen space on the southside.</description>

      <description>So my cable went out today. Lame. After giving up on debugging it - I started playing with the FireFox error pages. I just wanted to look at the HTML. So once I selected all and view the source of the page. I noticed this funny little piece of HTML:
 &amp;lt;xul:button xmlns:xul=&#34;http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul&#34; id=&#34;errorTryAgain&#34; label=&#34;Try Again&#34; oncommand=&#34;retryThis();&#34;/&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  So. Apparently there is only XUL. who is probably the keymaster and the gatekeeper.</description>

 This really interesting short film caught my eye the other day. It received the animation award at the Rushes Soho Shorts Festival. There are some pretty great moments in this piece, a good story, really interesting animation, and a great use of 2.</description>

Now that I can hang out on the Internet - work is starting to seem more like work and less like a crazy place. Everything is starting to come together. I can&#39;t wait for our office to be done. Its going to be awesome when we get our conference room, tables and other furniture.</description>

      <description>Watch this french commercial. I found it rather nice. In a sad sort of way. I like stuff like this. The last couple nights, I have watched the lord the rings trilogy. It is pretty awesome. I love it. I bought all the movies when they came out and had watched them sporadically after I owned them. But it is nice to sit and watch them in close proximity to the last one.</description>

      <description>I spent most of this weekend helping move our offices from our old place to our new place. Its amazing what a change of ~10k square feet can make. We started on Thursday packing and prepping the new space. Building racks, and generally fixing up the new space for our big moving day. Then on Friday the movers arrived and we all bundled up the shirts and rocked out. I was lucky and had to set up our adhoc (not as in computer to computer - but as in not planned) wifi network.</description>

      <description>So I canceled directTV awhile back and have been struggling to figure out how to easily download the shows I want to watch. I would love to do it legally. I have looked into the itunes solution - but they don&amp;rsquo;t have all I need/want. And it won&amp;rsquo;t work for hiromi - in japan. So I needed something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t region specific and something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard.
With these requirements I poked around quite a bit.</description>

      <description>I am not a fan of the current administration. In fact you could say that I really despise the current leadership of the United States. It is frustrating and annoying. I get so angry that I stop reading the news. Then I get angry and I have to get caught up. Then I get angry from reading the news. Its a vicious vicious cycle. So anyway. A couple months ago I got rid of my cable.</description>

      <description>So i decided to copy the success of my flickr badge and create a youtube badge. It works really easy and shows the last 6 videos you have uploaded. Its pretty cool. I used the youtube class i made the other day and just copied the functionality straight across from my flickr badge. haha. its awesome when you code well (its actually a mess&amp;hellip; sadly).
So check it out over at flashandburn.</description>

      <description>I just watched the korean movie oldboy (read this if you want to ruin the movie). Jesus Christ that movie is insane. I was not ready for the endeavor of watching that movie. Quite something. I rather enjoyed it. I am a sucker for movies that have good soundtracks. The story blew my mind. I had no idea it was going to become what it became. Whew. I have owned it for a number of years and just finally got around to watching it.</description>

      <description>Man. Today was pretty awesome. Woke up. Juggled. Ate good food. And wrote some dope PHP stuff.
After reading a bunch about some peoples PHP Youtube API implementation, I decided that i was tired of looking at some other peoples crappy and over complicated code. So i whipped up something that is really easy, works and is a class. I posted the code over at nata2.info - so check it out.</description>

      <description>I started with thestoryofharper.com and then I created the site for hiromi and myself. So after writing all the cool classes to make this easy I decided to make the blogs.nata2.org site and then tonight I redid the reedbooks.org site to be an aggregate of my families blogs. fun fun.
The sites follow a pretty simple formula. Basically all i am doing is picking up the RSS feeds of a particular set of blogs and displaying them nicely.</description>

      <description>This weekend was pretty fun. I guess most of my weekends are. This one started out super weird. On Friday&amp;nbsp;I was supposed to go to the sox game with Robyn. However, as I was leaving work - there was a tornado. haha. actually I was sitting,&amp;nbsp;finishing up some stuff at work and the air raid/ tornado sirens started up. It was insane. I have never heard those. I thought we were going to get bombed.</description>

      <title>Hacking mobile voicemail with Asterisk and caller ID spoofing</title>

      <guid>http://harper.blog/oldposts/2006-09-24-hacking-voicemail-with-asterisk-and-caller-id-spoofing/</guid>
      <description>So there has always had a problem with US mobile providers having their voicemail be susceptible to being compromised by calling with a spoofed caller id. Apparently most providers caller id apps just checks the referring callerid - and doesn&amp;rsquo;t force the voicemail user to pick a passcode; so it allows someone to trick the voicemail app into believing they are calling from a trusted number.
This has been covered all over the Internet and was in the spotlight awhile back when it was alleged that this was how Paris Hilton&amp;rsquo;s mobile phone was hacked.</description>

      <description>So i am on the train and i amd playing with my phone and i end up frying my sim card. apparently nokia has some security implementations that will fry your sim card if you enter the pin code wrong more than 5 times and then enter the PUK code wrong more than 10 times. So i called tmobile and they were like &amp;ldquo;you are screwed.&amp;rdquo; So i am sad. nobody can call and i can&amp;rsquo;t get txt messages.</description>

      <description>I redid this mini site using smarty, magpie rss and some other tricks. It is now pretty nice. I like using wordpress themes. It makes it easier. I can have a decent looking site (they are all blog like anyway) in about 5 minutes. Sometimes its a pain though. But it turned out nice i think.
So anyway, check out the site: blogs.nata2.org
All it is, is an aggregate of all my friends blogs.</description>

      <description>I love metal. Seriously. I love it. And metal concerts are always full of the most interesting experiences. However - the last couple shows I have been to I haven&#39;t really been into it. I remember back in the day when Matiss and I went to go see Dimmu Borgir and how awesome it was.&amp;nbsp; But lately I haven&#39;t really been into the whole scene. So I decided to try it out again.</description>

      <description>It was like a dream. an annoying dream.
I got on the train at jefferson park and noticed some dumbass meatheads sitting with their suburban looking girlfriends in the middle of the train. They were being loud and obnoxious and pretty annoying. Their were multiple angry looks by the other passengers as their rockus behavior became more and more rude. So anyway - I was sitting their and reading foundation by isaac asimov - minding my own business when one of the dudes starts yelling about how some dude just flipped him off.</description>

      <description>The other day I read the great post about Matt Cutt&#39;s SEO tips and tricks that were gleaned from his great blog. It was probably one of the most helpful SEO articles I had read in a minute. It summarized some points that I had learned throughout the years with just a couple sentences. Good work.
While the article was still fresh in my mind I was talking to Jacob about how our host, rackspace, now advertises on the DECK.</description>

      <description>I am watching the bbs documentary. Its amazing. I started watching clive barker&amp;rsquo;s Lord of Illusions - but it sucked. It always sucked. It sucked when i saw it in the theatre and it sucks now. So as soon as i remembered that it blew - i also remembered how awesome the BBS Doc was. So i put it in and now it is awesome. AWESOME i say.
I kinda want to run a bbs on one of my boxes.</description>

      <description>So i have been writing drafts of posts with windows live writer. It does a decent job. It makes blogging a bit more easy for peeps who don&amp;rsquo;t really like working in a browser. I think along with the flickr plugin - it may be a decent blog editor for people like my mom and dad, who are decent at computers but really don&amp;rsquo;t have a care to learn how to update a blog.</description>

      <description>So Hiromi and I are all married up now. Exciting. It was a weird and bureaucracy filled trip these last couple months and it all culminated with an excellent trip to Tokyo with my dad and Hiromi and us getting hitched.
So, apparently, attempting to get a visa to the U.S. is a bunch of work. It really demonstrates how much bureaucracy is involved in government work. When we were all done with our forms and what not, I bet I had one full ream of paper all filled out.</description>

      <description>First off - this is the most amazing music video i have ever seen. There is very little hyperbole in that statement. And since jacob has shown me that music video, i have been listening to muse like a madman. Such a funny video. Amazing.
Second - i made this website that aggregates hiromi and my blogs and flickr pictures into a nice little website. So you can check it out our posts and pictures all in one place.</description>

      <description>So falbum, the awesome flickr photo gallery for wordpress, broke this afternoon around 4pm due to the API key for the plugin expiring. This is annoying and somewhat funny. It seems that as of right now - all falbum sites are broken. hah. Every single one. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t this seem to be a flaw in flickr&amp;rsquo;s API program. I hope there is a way for the author of flabum to renew his API key.</description>

Its really weird - because if i log in using another account - it works fine. But if i log in using my primary account. its broken. So annoying. Especially because people are starting to adopt google talk as a more de facto way of contacting peeps.</description>

      <description>So i have been in chicago barely 12 hours. I slept 5 hours. And went to clubs for 7 hours. It was awesome. But the real reason i love chicago is the strict diversity that is celebrated at every turn. At every stop you see different people doing different things. All rocking it.
Tonight:
We started at sushi wabi. I had a steak - cuz i had just had excellent sashimi and sushi in tokyo and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to taint my memory with paltry really good sushi.</description>

We are going later to walk around where one of the BAPE stores are and just hang out. then to this awesome italian place in ginza. I am happy we didn&amp;rsquo;t really do anything crazy today. Its nice to have a normal existance with hiromi again. No running around. No going to crazy things. No government offices. Just hanging out. To the future!

      <description>So everything worked out and Hiromi and I were married on tuesday. It was really fun. and really barely more than signing a paper. which i liked quite a bit. Today we did the first part of the visa stuff. It was insane. and really crazy. totally stressful. government offices are annoying and really bureaucratic. i felt like i was in a terry gilliam movie. hah. But we are almost done - and the next part doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be too much different than this part - just a bit more &amp;ldquo;official.</description>

I am really excited and quite happy. hiromi and i have been dating for quite awhile and will be getting married on the 29th of august in Yamanashi. I am quite excited. I have kept this quiet - because well&amp;hellip; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally official for awhile.. we haven&amp;rsquo;t actually been around each other to officiate things and well i didn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about it too much before things go to the point were it was almost real.</description>

The crazy part was in the beginning. We were all sitting their watching the movie chilling out and what not and i shifted in my chair and accidently bumped the chair in front of me. I mumbled an apology and then sat back.</description>

Someday i will meet mos def and i will say &#34;Yo Mos. I really like your work&#34; and he will look at me and say &#34;no problem. anytime.&#34; </description>

      <description>So today after running some errands downtown i came home and about died. I slept like a baby until around 10. confused and hungry i awoke. I felt like hell still. which sucked. I was totally (totally dude) supposed to go to a bbq around 7. But i just didn&amp;rsquo;t have it in me. and now its 11:39 and i am still achey and tired.
However, after i ate and chilled for a minute, i decided to try the neti pot again.</description>

      <description>i am pretty sure i was a bit tipsy when i wrote my last rant/entry. hah. but nobody knows. i can&amp;rsquo;t possibly imagine that it makes a whole bundle of sense.
Last night i watched &amp;ldquo;Lost in translation&amp;rdquo; and a bit of &amp;ldquo;Endless Sunshine of a blah blah blah.&amp;rdquo; Tonight i am watching &amp;ldquo;Jesus&amp;rsquo; Son.&amp;rdquo; Such great movies. I really love Jesus&amp;rsquo; Son. I think it may be one of my favorite stories.</description>

      <description>Just a warning to all who would read this - i think i was a bit tipsy when writing it. so it is very very ranting and probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.
 I have been playing around in my head with scenarios of what must happen when an organization which has a philosophy of using only open source suddenly finds itself in need of a closed source solution. This seems to me to be an interesting quandary for the poor open source only people.</description>

I think my favorite new movie director is Michel Gondry. I was not aware that he was a drummer. Apparently he played drums on a Kanye West track. Amazing. His new movie looks quite nice. Science des rêves, La.</description>

      <description>Tonight while talking about my crazy hair in high school and showing my roommate chris some pictures from high school i stumbled upon all my old tickets from concents and what not from the past 16 years. I apparently have gone to an ass load of concerts. Maybe over 150. It was surpriseing to look at all of these tickets and realize that i have spent at least 3 hours if not more time per piece of paper.</description>

The last 3 days have been full of crazy parties and fun people. On thursday was the kill hannah party at crobar. It ruled. Then on friday was Dark Wave Disco - with lady SOV and Tommie Sunshine. After that was the party with the motherfucker peeps and the virgin tears. Then of course.. the afterpary. it was pretty much the same thing as before. haha.</description>

      <description>So Wikipedia is getting a lot of coverage for all of the doings of the wikimedia foundation ($100 Laptop Partnership, Wikiversity, Wikiwyg). A lot of amazing stuff. And not only amazing - but helpful and really community friendly. I think that Wikipedia is really in a place to change the world. However - with that said - I think they need to concentrate on a part of their site that is integral: the search.</description>

      <description>Well&amp;hellip; not me per se - but one of my websites. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know which one, but judgeing from what i have heard - i think they talked about my flickr myspace badge. This is the second time i have heard about being in wired. The first was for audreyhacking.com and i don&amp;rsquo;t think i even saw that one for real. Only for fake. Wow. So if anyone has a scan of the mention - email it to me.</description>

      <description>so i am not a large person. i am no where near little either. I grew up really skinny and just in the last few years have gained weight. Recently i noticed that i gained a belly. Not the ironic funny belly - but a legit paunch. I don&amp;rsquo;t really want a paunch - and after talking to some friends who are quiet well taken care of they mentioned that it most likely is the fact that i snack a lot and drink about 300 pops a day.</description>

Then on friday - i picked up my cousin kile at his hotel and we went to my work. He caused trouble and played xbox. I worked on our new secret project. After work - we went to sushi wabi and then kile went and played in the fountains in millenium park.</description>

      <description>So i think it is awesome that seth godin was able to &#34;convince&#34; google to give joel on software a google search appliance. That is amazing. I mean - Joel probably needed a better search engine, but what makes me mad is this:
Wikipedia needs a better search engine more than joel on software needs a better search engine. Wikipedia is probably one of the coolest sites on the internet right now.</description>

      <guid>http://harper.blog/oldposts/2006-07-26-worst-planning-ever-chicagos-buses/</guid>
      <description>So i ride the bus a lot. Maybe 4 times a day. It is quite something. I spend most of that time waiting for the bus and being annoyed. But a small portion of that time is spent boarding various versions of the chicago cta bus. The one pictured on the right is the worst design i have ever seen for public transportation efficiency. Basically the user with the &amp;ldquo;fast RFID type card&amp;rdquo; enters the bus through the door and then waits for everyone else to put their card in the slot near the driver.</description>

      <description>So tonight i was awesome. I mean. i am always pretty awesome. but tonight i really ruled. I have been trying to send a text message to eveyone in my phone book saying the caption from the family circus cartoon on the right: &amp;ldquo;Oh my god. I can see forever.&amp;rdquo; However - my phone kept crashing whenever i adding more than 100 people to a text message. So tonight i figured - while waiting on the train i would go ahead and break it up into a bundle of smaller messages and see how it worked out.</description>

      <description>So this weekend was pretty fun. I just worked a bunch. Finished some stuff and played around a lot. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really go out much. On friday, Chris, Tag and myself went to see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&amp;rsquo;s Chest. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too good or bad - but Cecil&amp;rsquo;s face was in it. that ruled. Afterward we went to Y bar and crobar. Simple night really.. On saturday i just hung out.</description>

I use windows for development - which really means that i just use windows for putty and firefox. I use linux to host and write code. and i use OSX for personal information management. Today i am going to tell yall how i use the i-suite and Google Calendar to have my calendars accessible all the time.</description>

      <description>AHAHA. i loves swearing.
I was just perusing digg and found this article on newsforge: Why Linux isn&amp;rsquo;t mainstream. It has some good points but i don&amp;rsquo;t really understand where this person has been for the last 3 years. Of course linux isn&amp;rsquo;t mainstream. The only mainstream OS is the OS that runs the consumer desktops. This is because the &amp;ldquo;suits&amp;rdquo; are not the technologists. They are basically &amp;ldquo;architects,&amp;rdquo; designing solutions and architecting systems from 1000 feet.</description>

      <description>So myspace is annoying. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. i have two accounts and over a thousand &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo; - but i hate how the site looks, works and exists. It is like the bastion of all i hate on the internet. Bad design, Bad usability and bad user relations. Myspace hates their users. They blame their users on their problems. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is a good way to maintain their postion in the ever changing social network world.</description>

      <description>So tonight i have been playing with Six Aparts VOX blog service. Besides the confusing name (probably only confusing to me - the alcoholic podcaster) Six Aparts social network blog thing is pretty cool. Check out my profile here and my &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; here. I like the idea behind the VOX social network. I have long thought that SA is pretty smooth at executing products. The Movable Type platform was always nice looking and easy to use.</description>

      <description>So we don&amp;rsquo;t have air conditioning. I mean. we have one small unit that sits in our living room and makes watching television somewhat bearable - but we don&amp;rsquo;t have central air or even something close to that. So we die. It is honestly around 100 degrees in my room. as you can imagine that makes it pretty hard to sleep.
Rough.
One thing i have done to combat the heat is drink a lot of water and sleep on a towel.</description>

      <description>This is not good. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that our world and more specifically the United States president/foriegn policy can handle an actual War in the middle east. We will act stupid and say that lebanon is a terror state.. then syria.. then iran.. and all the while israel will be &amp;ldquo;preemptively&amp;rdquo; bombing every arab/moslem state they can find. This is bad. I, of course, am not jewish/arab/moslem/israeli/palestian/labanese/nebraskan but it seems that israel attacking so many soverign countries while the world(except for the US) is shouting for them to stop is only going to lead us into a rather dark period of war.</description>

      <description>This is a followup to the post about openDNS from July 10th. So we used openDNS for a couple days. It worked really well. Then it failed. We were all trying to do something and no one in the office was having DNS issues. So we rolled it back.
I think if there were a couple more servers - or it was distributed a bit more i would be more apt to use it in this &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; way.</description>

      <description>So for awhile i have been paying attention to the BAPE/BBC phenomona that is invading hiphop. I guess i should say it has invaded hiphop. Anyway. I have admired the all over print, crazy foil, insane patterned hoodies and shirts for far too long. I am going to try and acquire some stuff that is insane. INSANE i tell you.
so first i started talking to hiroki about all this nonsense.</description>

      <description>I just put openDNS into place at skinny. It is a neat DNS &amp;ldquo;replacement&amp;rdquo; that is a bit more intelligent than regular DNS. it apparently checks for phishing and notifies the user that they are going to a &amp;ldquo;phishing site.&amp;rdquo; This is pretty cool stuff - however i am worried about who chooses the phishing sites.

      <description>Woah. I am so damned tired. I slept a LOT today. Like nap after nap after nap. and no actual rest. So this weekend was nuts. First off it was intonation festival weekend. I usually HATE festivals but intonation is often fun and full of good bands. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to go - but tommie is in town and had passes - so i was able to stop by. I saw the boredoms, ghostface killer, the streets and lady soverign.</description>

      <description>so i accidently spent like 100 hours in the last month reading this goddamn scifi series. It was super annoying. really good stuff. but a really bad author. well not really bad. but not very good. all the reviews said that when reading the series - you can&amp;rsquo;t wait a very long time between books because the plot is so thin. so true. but the story is great. but now i am done.</description>

On monday I picked her up and we hung out around my house. Went to our friend becca&amp;rsquo;s house and hung out. It was fun. After that we went home - picked up chris - went to irazu and then went to the empty bottle to see becca&amp;rsquo;s husband&amp;rsquo;s band &amp;ldquo;just a fire.&amp;rdquo; It was good - but hiromi about died from jet lag.</description>

Got dressed. check my email. checked my text messages. and i had a txt from my buddy mike telling me my server was broke. so i checked it out. i couldn&amp;rsquo;t ssh into it or anything - which is very very unusual.

I am always a bit surprised when i see the mountains or the sunset. Also the weather is so nice. a lot nicer than chicago. Especially this weekend.
I got in late on friday and i just ate easy mac, slept and read a bit.</description>

      <description>So my friend liz sent me a belated birthday gift. It was some of her mens geek jewlery from her pretty successful zellestyle line of stuff. Neat stuff. She sent me a midi bracelet and some little nice black wire bracelets. I am happy because i had just thought about wearing bracelets again and i was tired of my custom devil gauntlets that i used to wear. Thanks liz.

It was awesome. I have posted some pictures of the biodiesel installation on flickr.</description>

      <description>I have been using ubuntu for a minute here while i compile some software for use on my soekris box at work. I am attempting to move from the old pebble linux to the new pyramid linux made by the metrix guys. Its pretty dope so far. a lot more modern, but sadly not mature. I need to compile in PCMCIA support and whatnot. a real pain ;)
I did find a hint for one of my initial problems while building out the pyramid build environment.</description>

      <description>I am waiting for my flight. my family left to colorado about 30 minutes ago and my flight is delayed until 8:00. sad. only 4 hours. i thought it would be a good opportunity to go and find a book to read in the bad airport book stores. sadly there was NO interesting books. Only dan brown, steven king, michael crichten and john grisham. Those dudes must be novel factories. I mean i know dan brown has defined a formula and is just pumping out books following the same &amp;ldquo;basic&amp;rdquo; plot - and i assume those other authors have as well.</description>

It was amazing. One of the craziest and coolest things i have done. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting the number of people - nor the feelings and emotions that were around. It was pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started monday morning when i called charlie and was like &amp;ldquo;you in - word. i am in.&amp;rdquo; He showed up and we went to the division and ashland intersection. There was the nearest meetup to start the parade. We then walked with everyone to union park. and hung out for awhile. and from there we walked down randolph and then another street. Hah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly we had to go around 1pm so we had to split once we reached  michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a movie and will be posting it after the jump. Check it out. I have posted all my pictures on flickr. Check them out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72057594122367015/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I was talking to my &amp;ldquo;phone connection&amp;rdquo; and it looks as though the nokia N80 is out in the wild. You can check it out here. The N80 seems like a pretty cool phone. it has all the features that one could possibly want - good camera, good os, good form factor and wifi.
I think for me the selling point is the wifi. Although on the N80 you are unable to use the phone as a VOIP SIP device, it would still be one of the coolest things ever.</description>

      <description>I used this awesome trick to get on the yahoo mail beta. it is pretty cool. a nice rich interface for mail. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it as much as gmail - but it is really nice. I think gmail seems snappier - but it may just be the amount of color and &amp;ldquo;chrome&amp;rdquo; that yahoo man versus the minimal interface that gmail is offering.
If anyone would like to try out the beta themselves just follow these instructions: How to change your content preference:  log in to Yahoo Mail click Options select Account information from the left panel go to Member Information, General Preferences, Preferred Content select, for example, Yahoo UK click Finished go to Yahoo Mail you&amp;rsquo;ll see a page that says &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the New Yahoo!</description>

      <description>So i am kinda tired. i have been sick for the last month. it is lame. First i thought it was just jetlag mixed with matiss&amp;rsquo;s germs from his sickness mixed with being in tokyo and then the US so fast. But then it never really ended - so i decided that i probably have/had a sinus infection and wouldjust have to fight it. So i went to the doctor. He was like &amp;ldquo;yea.</description>

      <description>Hacking Stuff 
I quite enjoy manipulating and hacking stuff. It could a web application, learning AJAX or XSLT or taking apart the latest awesome consumer appliance. Ever since before college I have been interested in writing software, taking stuff apart and making new things.  Here is a short history since 2001 of stuff that I have been concertrating on hacking or manipulating.  2006 ~ We shall see&amp;hellip; 2005 ~ Play Station Portable - Having seen the jakes PSPs while working on squidoo, i was impressed with what they were able to do with them.</description>

      <description>My friend jacob got a Nokia 3250 on my recommendation and was disappointed that it didn&amp;rsquo;t have as many apps as my N70 did. So while scouring the internet and looking for applications for him i decided that i would create an application list for the Symbian 3rd edition phones.  Here it goes:  Handy Weather - Putty -  If you have found software that is hopefully missing from this list.</description>

      <description>Here are a bundle of # codes for nokia phones. Quite a few of them work for my N70 and my 7610 so i imagine they work on a lot of phones - but use at your own risk.  *#0000# Check firmware version*3370# This Nokia code activates Enhanced Full Rate Codec (EFR) - Your Nokia cell phone uses the best sound quality but talk time is reduced my approx. 5%</description>

      <description>So now that everyone is finally interested in getting a symbian phone - i decided to unearth some tricks and what not for symbian phones.
I have tried most of these. I am not quite sure where i got this list - probably from some yahoo group or some site years ago when i got my 7610. Most of it works on my N70 so it should all be still current.</description>

      <description>So i got gmail back this morning. had a bundle of mail that i didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see yesterday. weird. What was really annoying was that google didn&amp;rsquo;t respond and that there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a response before. It just seems that they are ignoring a problem. Even if they were like &amp;ldquo;oh your email is broken until tomorrow&amp;rdquo; that would be better. it was rather frustrating..
maybe it is time to move to yahoo.</description>

      <description>Today was a long day. I have been going to bed so early and then getting up early. It has been nice. But I need to figure out the point of sleep moderation - or i need to get well. It seems that every day around 11 o clock i get kinda sick. Like my throat gets irratated and i cough a bit more. Probably just weak still from my fight with the cold.</description>

      <description>Sorry i have been in such a &amp;ldquo;not blogging&amp;rdquo; mood, but i have been in a real bad state since i got back. I got back last saturday and of course was jet-lagged. As soon as that was over i realized that i had contrated some space cold from either the plane, the train or matiss. So i basically spent the last week at work and then at home sleeping or reading or eating my new fancy ramen soup combo pasta surprise.</description>

      <description>Man. i got up today at 6:30. WTF. That is not normal. and i am sick. i have a running nose, a stomach ache and my throat is scratchy. Sad. I hope this passes&amp;hellip; the getting up early not the sickness.
Last night i finished up the first draft of my ambient device. it is pretty ghetto - but i am doing some cool stuff. I am running the RGB from the RGB controller to my LEDs with 4 wire phone cord.</description>

      <description>So i got back this morning. i wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to sleep or anything so i went on the needed journey to get some project pieces and tools. I went to radio shack and home depot. all by walking. it was pretty awesome. i am now really tired. i imagine later tonight i will through up a play by play of my time in tokyo with hiromi. but for now i am going to throw up a play by play of me sleeping.</description>

I really needed to bring a book - but it was dark and i didn&amp;rsquo;t want to wake up my neighbors. but i made it. Immigtation was sooo easy. They just said ok.
I just got to hiromi&amp;rsquo;s house. It is really tiny. two rooms - stacked.</description>

      <description>So this weekend was pretty cool. On friday i took a long nap and went to smart bar with kira. Mark verbos was doing his live P.A. bit. It was pretty awesome. I really like the knob tweaking and acidish noise that occurs whenever mark does his thing. The new smartbar is really dope. Crazy lighting, and an incredible sound system. Seriously. and INCREDIBLE sound system. It is massive. Nice work on that.</description>

      <description>The last couple weeks have been ultra nerdy. It has been great. I got my gumstix and have been rocking that - attempting to get a handle on how i am going to make that work. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like it will be all that hard to theoretically make. I am worried about having to prototype a daughterboard for the gunmstix - since i haven&amp;rsquo;t ever really made a circuit board in real life.</description>

      <description>As you probably noticed, i was at work late last night. As usual, My coworker andrew was also here. Often when it is just the two of us - we theorize and talk about everything that is going on like two old stoners in a VW van. Its nuts. We cover everything from office politics to why stars are green. hah. Anyway, last night andrew said a couple of things that made me really think.</description>

      <description>So yesterday i worked a lot. It was awesome. I enjoy being in a position where i really like what i am working on. It makes staying on task that much easier. In the past, when i was working at other companies, i would often have to work on two or three things of my own just to pass the time between real work and meetings and all that corporate crap that occurs at companies that are really old or really dumb.</description>

      <description>Seriously. It is killing me. I am rather frustrated.
So i was reading russell&amp;rsquo;s post on flash lite and was like &amp;ldquo;yippee.. more s60 software for my shiny n70.&amp;rdquo; and i clicked his fancy link to macromedia.com page to &amp;ldquo;buy&amp;rdquo; the software. Well. after filling out 30 goddamn forms and clicking all around this really stupid flash app - i finally got to a place where i can download the file.</description>

      <title>Investigating the nabaztag</title>

      <guid>http://harper.blog/oldposts/2006-02-27-investigating-the-nabaztag/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my gumstix today and was lauding the fanciness of the smallest comptuer i have EVER seen, explaining to my coworker Dan how i was going to build an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ambientdevices.com/&#34;&gt;ambient orb&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://nabaztag.com/&#34;&gt;nabaztag &lt;/a&gt;like device that will integrate with my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nokia.com/n70&#34;&gt;bluetooth phone&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&#34;http://asteriskathome.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;pbx&lt;/a&gt;. he was impressed of course ;) - and told me that our coworker jake already had a &lt;a href=&#34;http://nabaztag.com/&#34;&gt;nabaztag&lt;/a&gt;. I was like &amp;ldquo;WOAH.&amp;rdquo; Those little punks are hard to get here in the states. So i talked to jake and he brought it in for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/105460276/in/photostream&#34;&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; src=&#34;http://static.flickr.com/44/105460276_f112fd265d_m.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got it - it wasn&amp;rsquo;t booting correctly, saying there was a problem by flashing yellow. hah. It coudln&amp;rsquo;t find its home WIFI net and obviously couldn&amp;rsquo;t access &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.skinnycorp.com&#34;&gt;skinnyCorps&lt;/a&gt;. So i looked at all the documentation and found that it is REALLY easy to fix.  All you do is unplug it, hold the top button down, plug it in and then access the nabaztag wifi network. Then load up your browser and access the webpage for easy nabaztag configuration - including a nice &amp;ldquo;scan networks&amp;rdquo; feature. Personally  I feel that this is one of the coolest features of almost any wifi gadget out there. Could you imagine if the Airport express was as easy to setup, or those bastard wifi cameras? I mean really. How mcuh time could i have saved instead of unhooking the camera and plugging it into ethernet. So much time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. So while we were trying to get it to work, jake let me know that it had been thrown and may have been broken. How sad. So i immediately offered to take it apart and fix er up.  So I did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I watched 4 hours of hallmark tv. first a movie about christmas and then some movie about some heart wrenchy crap. it was so bad. so i changed channels and watched TNT. First i watched money train, then passenger 57 and then i watched a bunch of the logo network. The logo network has such interesting documentaries. Right now i am watching a documentary about butch lesbians.</description>

In other words and other worlds - i attempted to use monowall to jumpstart my box. however - it didn&amp;rsquo;t work, they don&amp;rsquo;t have a shell to log into.</description>

I made it a bit more user friendly, made it a bit more web 2.0 and really fixed up the backend. The biggest change is that i added youtube content and added all my nata2.info pictures. I want to start doubling my nata2.info income. hah. maybe by replicating the site. haha. we shall see.
The reason i did this - is i have been playing around with a php framework that i want to use for my future sites - and i needed a place to try it out.</description>

      <description>and sleep deprevation is destroying my ADD.
I really feel that ADD helps me work on all my projects. For instance today: I worked on extratasty for 3 hours, I played with the stompbox and the verizon card for 3 hours and I did &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; on some other projects (jacobs sync hah) for awhile. But - it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really in blocks like that - it was threaded. So everything was happening at once.</description>

      <description>Oh yea. I forgot to mention that i released a new version of my campfirenow.com bot framework. It is quite a bit better and a lot more robust - however i imagine that 37signals has changed things to stop it.
Check out the source: here
I also released a proof of concept flood. its real annoying and stupid. don&amp;rsquo;t use it. i just wanted to see if i could make it.</description>

      <description>I have cleaned up and commented a little hack i did for my home asterisk server - allowing a person to dial an extension and then be walked through spoofing caller id on a call. It is a ridiculously easy hack to engage. I was surprised and a bit concerned at what this means in regards to trust and telephony. I mean, if a hobbyist is able to spoof caller id on a phone call to anywhere with nothing more than asterisk@home and vmware.</description>

      <description>seirously. i just lay in bed. feeling sick. breathing out of my mouth and bummed that i can&amp;rsquo;t sleep.
so i thought up a couple interesting ideas that i would like to take up in the next couple months. First - a set of discrete devices that are connected via a bluetooth PAN. like a small network of ambient devices: a glowing orb, a dial, &amp;ldquo;agent,&amp;rdquo; a couple small black boxes to integrate with stereo&amp;rsquo;s or video signals and of course a way to integrate with cell phones.</description>

      <description>Awhile ago i picked myself up an ambient orb. It is a really cool idea - basically a device that will let you see information at a glance. For example - seeing how a server is doing based on the orbs color, or seeing what the weather is like based on the color. a lot of options. but the coolest part is that it is not obtrusive to your everyday life.</description>

      <title>Campfire perl bot hack </title>

      <description>So i was playing around with campfire and i noticed that i could easy write a bot for it. so i did. it sucks. but it shows what you could do. how i love www mechanize. and perl. check it out:
http://nata2.info/?path=code%2Fcampfire_bot_hack
Oh yea. campfire is sweet. the 37signals guys did a great job. although i am a bit worried about how you can spoof the message post url in a tinurl and make anyone who clicks on it say whatever you want them to say ;) but that is naturally a weakness in a webchat.</description>

      <description>Whew.
I have this secret plan to start blogging more regularly and to up the level of intelligence that go into the posts. I am trying to diminish the amount of &amp;ldquo;so. i went to a club and then i went to another club and there were people&amp;rdquo; posts - instead having &amp;ldquo;so. i went to a club and there were these people and they do interesting things like&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; and then post more often and more about technology.</description>

      <description>So yesterday i got up rather late ~ like 3pm. That isn&amp;rsquo;t really unusual. I usually get up quite late on saturdays. I was thinking that i have maybe not &amp;ldquo;wasted&amp;rdquo; a saturday to sleep 50 times in the last 5 years. I enjoy it. i feel that it is some of the only time i have JUST to myself. sleep. hah. and i am always in a constant state of sleep dep - that it is helpful.</description>

      <description>i was recently reminded of why i hate companies who are way too full of themselves. just in the past week i called a company here in chicago that does some stuff that we were interested in using. they totally blew me off when they realized i wasn&#39;t going to use their managed services. wtf. we would have droppped a lot of money on them. we could easily have rivaled what any of their other clients were doing.</description>

      <description>As yall know i have been playing and hacking with the Asterisk open source PBX. In my exploration time i have been looking at some great sites on asterisk and came across this relaly great asterisk guy named benjk. He runs the sunrise-tel.com site that releases and maintains some OSX Asterisk packages. Quite amazing. The work they are doing is pushing Asterisk into a completely different market than some of the other asterisk distributions.</description>

      <description>so i sit in front of my TV and listen to music or watch old movies while i code. It is probably killer on my back and such - but it makes coding a lot less lonely and i get a lot done. But tonight it was really bad. My airport express was being a bitch and their was shit on tv - so i ended up watching VH1. MAN. i love crappy music.</description>

      <description>I am lost in regards to what to listen to. I need something new. Or old. i don&amp;rsquo;t know.
This is really amazing. For some reason people are taking &amp;ldquo;famous&amp;rdquo; videos and making them &amp;ldquo;stable.&amp;rdquo; It is quite interesting and makes watching the videos a bit more mysterious - cuz the video becomes much more clear and&amp;hellip; stable. hah.
Christmas was cool. Hiromi came over from tokyo around the 19th. We hung out with a bunch of people.</description>

      <description>So asterisk is amazing. i have been plating with it quite a bit. I recently hooked it up at skinnyCorp and got it to be there PBX. it is quite amusing to have that much control and granularity with the phone system. I am contemplating rolling out a small scale service based on the asterisk platform. It should be interesting. stay tuned. TUNED I SAY.
Work has been awesome.
Oh yea.</description>

On wednesday i arriveed. my mother had made all of us kids (dylan, jon, me, sarah, and my cousins) fur vests. Most of them were wolverine fur, but some were from some fantasy animal. They are awesome. So we donned our fur vests and continued to rule for the weekend.</description>

      <description>Work has been really crazy. We are having a sale and its nutso. are servers were totally owned by our users and we had to fight every one of them to survive. but we did it. and now threadless is ruling - more or less. soon it will be ruling always. and forever.
flickr is so slow sometimes.
i am sleepy. i will be going to bed soon. i really want to install linux on my old desktop to be a fileserver and an awesome computer - hosting things like a phone system and the like - but i don&amp;rsquo;t have a monitor.</description>

      <description>So last nights late night game playing was maybe not the best idea to quell my sickness. but it ruled so much. we came to my work around 7 to play some half life deathmatch and counterstrike: source. and we left around 3:30am - totally inadvertently. we had planned to leave much earlier cuz both matiss and I have to work in the morning. somehow though.. killing those counter terrorists really got us riled up and not interested in sleep.</description>

      <description>So. I have been at work a lot lately.
So my amp mod is pretty dope. Although i get a fierce hum when i charge the battery - i have decided to move forward and build the rest of it. I think i am going to build four distinct parts. First the power supply. i am thinking that the power supply should be completely separate from all of the other components - mostly cuz it is totally noise causing and i will be able to replace it if needed.</description>

      <description>I purchased a t-amp awhile ago and have been listening to it in it stock form for the last 5 days. i am quite impressed with it. It is as good if not better than my receiver i had before. Last time i looked to purchase an amp i was frustrated with the availability of stereo only amps that were of good quality and not crazy expensive. so this is a godsend.</description>

      <description>So seth godin&amp;rsquo;s newest project is starting to leak out to the world. It is quite exciting to see what we worked on all summer become something real and tactile. I was choosen as an intern around the beginning of the summer and worked with the crew for the summer doing architecture and infrastructure design for the project.
It was a very nice time. I was able to interact with very smart people who really knew a lot about the internet and this whole web 2.</description>

      <description>once again and for real this time i am going to attempt to read and finish gravity&amp;rsquo;s rainbow by pynchon. holy jesus - that guy is verbose. man. its like reading a freshman philosophy class without all the poor prosylytizing and nonsense. it is just thick as hell and full of words. its nice though. it makes me remember my first attempt at reading catch-22 - but when i was in 5th grade.</description>

      <description>So i have been reading these short, sad, very violent books about society. It is pretty rough.
the first i read was A Personal Matter by Kenzoburo Oe which was about this lostish young man whose wife gives birth to a baby with a severe birth defect. The book is about his struggle to understand his life and the violence within it. it is very dark. reminded me a lot of the Rabbit books, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t as thorough.</description>

      <description>haha.
anyway.. i am going to build out a new stereo for my room. i am pretty excited. It will be a simple inexpensive/expensive hifi system. some good speakers, a preamp, a good amp, a cd player, an ipod dock and that is about it. I have been excited about the T-amp from Sonic Impact . it is amazing and totally has a little homebrew, hacking movement set around it. I am quite excited - especially about haveing some really cool looking stereo equipment.</description>

      <description>I think it is interesting that i can make a purchase and then use the restroom in a restaurant - but i wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to before i made the purchase. Like going to starbucks and buying a coffee so i can use the bathroom. the 3 dollars means i could use drugs, kill children or whatever they are trying to stop by making the bathrooms for customers only.
I see this sort of transaction a lot.</description>

      <description>So i don&amp;rsquo;t usually do it. i only do it when i feel its easy - or maybe when it is hardest. i don&amp;rsquo;t really know. i imagine you can totally tell by reading my past entries. regardless of how easy or hard it is - i totally thinkthat i need to blog sometimes. and whether or not i do is a different story. i wish i had a blogging client that made it easy to update my blog in quick places.</description>

      <description>I just watched the beginning of this awesome movie. It was about this women Susan Tom who is raising 11 adopted children all with severe illness or handicaps. It is heart wrenching. I was sitting here trying to find something mindless to put on so i could work with the TV and BAM. sorrow. seriously though - if you have a chance, and a bunch of kleenex - check this movie out.</description>

      <description>seriously. new orleans got knocked the fuck down. It is amazing how nature can take a piece of something that we think is strong and then remove our conception of strength without even thinking of it. I remember reading the other day about how the hurricane had POUNDED miami and it was going to disrupt the VMAs (oh my god!!) - but no one had even an inkling of how powerful and destructive it could end up being.</description>

He has posted an MP3 of what he basically did tonight (albeit tonight was quite a bit harder). you should check it out.</description>

      <description>So i mistakenly packed this swiss army knife that my brother got for me when he went to switzerland years ago in my carry on luggage. I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to and i had forgotten it was there - cuz i brought it in case i needed it on our road trip. So the airline people took it. Stuff like this always makes me sad. stupid airlines. stupid US being in a fear state.</description>

      <description>I am currently working and watching the documentary &amp;ldquo;Control Room.&amp;rdquo; It is really incredible. Quite something. watching the footage of the hostages being interviewed really brought me back to the feelings i had. It is insane to see the backend of Al Jazeera. They are soo smart; they really had their shit together. it is madness. The discussion of reporter objectivity is very important i think. And listening to the media people change their response to aj jazeera.</description>

      <description>So i was working with seth - wrapping up my summer gig and hanging out a bit. and he was telling me that he was going to throw out some water damaged audiophile equipment that he had laying around. He then offered me the equipment - and i of course said YES.
Ever since i was a child i have had a nack of gathering broke ass audio equipment - whether it be HUGE 18&amp;rdquo; bass cabinets or a 60s reverb box, i have always had a nack of getting some great stuff.</description>

      <description>I just finished the newest harry potter book. I quite enjoyed it. (i have turned the spiolers white - unless you are in an RSS reader)I was of course about dumbledore&amp;rsquo;s demise and snape turning(hah) evil. but i was more bummed about harry&amp;rsquo;s ejection of ginny. WHY. they are so cute. hahaha. 
anyway. i am &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo; at Tommie&amp;rsquo;s house here in Brooklyn - with internet and directtv. stuck isn&amp;rsquo;t so much the situation as i didn&amp;rsquo;t really make any moves to find another place to stay.</description>

      <description>I am in nyc. sitting at tommie&amp;rsquo;s apartment - listening to remixes and puffy electro. awesome.
the yoyo contest was a lot of fun. i inadvertently may have starred in my first &amp;ldquo;porn&amp;rdquo; movie. As a joke on another yoyo player - me and some Duncan kids got naked and recorded over some of their &amp;ldquo;choice footage.&amp;rdquo; Oh yes. it ruled. however. may or will be quite scandalous. Another strike against my presidential campaign.</description>

      <description>I am watching tv and the women on the TV has awesome glasses. they are huge. I am watching a pretty sad documentary about two kids from chicago poor neighborhoods that are trying to get into the NBA. it is good. a bummer. life certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t fair.
This weekend rocks. Last night was the lollapalooza preparty at crobar. it was madness. Chris Holmes is here, Tommie Sunshine is here, everyone is back.</description>

      <description>So my life was in shambles. but i am feeling it come back. For one. i cleaned my room. that seriously helped. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know i had so much space. i coudl sleep anywhere. basically all i did was remove all the geeky stuff. like the cell phones, the computers, the audreys and the like. the second thing i did - was fix my computers. I changed up hard drives. merged my MP3 Libraries.</description>

      <description>Yes. it is true. i am freakishly busy. and of course while being freakishly busy i find the most time expensive hobby ever. So matiss and i have been playing quake 3 again. We were playing the requiem mod for hours, but it got kinda boring so we switched to the urban terror full conversion. It rules.
I am totally not a game player, but i am suddenly VERY interested in playing counterstrike and solcom.</description>

That ended with us eating tater tots at 4 in the morning. and INCREDIBLE idea. seriously. whoever invented that was smart. S M R T. then the plane fiasco.
now i am at work. making stuff happen. I am flying out tonight to san fran for some fun with the gravitymobile guys.</description>

      <description>I hate airports as of yesterday.
It all started about 1.5 months ago. I got word that i was coming to NYC for some work stuff so i went on orbitz and purchased some tickets. about two weeks after that i double checked and noticed much to my surprise that i had purchased tickets for some random weekend in July. wtf. i have never done that before. i pride myself in being rather &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; at the internet and i am usually accurate in my typings - so i must have just flustered and fuxored it all up.</description>

      <description>oh yea. i am here. well not really nyc. somewhere near i guess. got in this morning around 9:00am after leaving my house at 4:00 (that sucked for sure). Then i slept very uncomfortably on the unsleepable chairs at the airport. slept around 4 hours. and then went downstairs and yoyoed for 4 hours.
After my yoyo extravaganza we met up and went to thai food. I love thai food. this place was great.</description>

      <description>Last night hiromi and mark and myself went and saw mr. and mrs. smith. it was pretty nice. Really funny. a lot of good relationship jokes. The only flaw was that we got there late so we had to sit in the very front row. kind of a bummer. but it ruled.
This weekend was pretty chilled out. I hung out friday. there was a going away party for suresh after work - which allowed me to hang out with all my ex-coworkers.</description>

I bought them right before it was &lt;a href=&#34;http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/01/1651220&#34;&gt;posted to slashdot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We got almost the entire way through the application with some MAJOR pieces missing - but not so bad for barely 8 hours or whatever. we totally coudl have finished if we would have actually used the 24 hours. but we have lives. haha. and we are not super ruby peeps.</description>

      <description>So i went to the doctor yesterday and was like &amp;ldquo;what the hell is wrong with my broke ass foot&amp;rdquo; and the doctor was like &amp;ldquo;well what have you eaten recently?&amp;rdquo; heh. wtf. eating and feet are related. apparently if you drink a lot and eat mostly hotdogs - they are. so i guess i have goutted up my big toe and am working on fixing it. its pretty retarded - expecially that it occured right after i consumed more meat and rich food than i had in probably a year.</description>

      <description>So my foot really really hurts. i have NO idea what i did. seriously. none. no memory of banging it on something, or hitting it, or crushing it or anything. i just woke up on monday and it really hurt. On monday i could walk a bit. then by monday night - i could barely walk on it. so i took a warm bath, no help; i put it on ice, nothing; i slept, that helped (heh) but when i woke up today it was killing me again.</description>

The stage is amazing and i like billy&amp;rsquo;s new stuff. it was weird cuz i haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a concert in a very long time. so being at this one was like being at a concert in my living room. it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem real.</description>

I have instead been coding ruby on rails applications. it is fun. i am kinda bored. sorta. not really. i was bored. then i discovered the ajax helpers. haha. so much fun. unfortunately a site such as harperreed.org doesn&amp;rsquo;t lend itself to being ajax&amp;rsquo;d. I was able to do some fanciness with the quotation on the front and the contact form.</description>

Basically it is an mvcish platform that runs off of ruby. it is pretty snappy and VERY VERY easy to roll out webapps. pretty handy. i have dreams of a new webapp everyday.</description>

      <description>Lots and lots of writing has taken place. it is pretty nuts. i have been blogging since march 1st 2000. it is pretty nuts. A lot of words. a lot of randomness. a HUGE number of rants and a couple emotions. hah. mostly just drivel. it rules. Since 2000 i have had two jobs, hosted probably 200 websites, gone to the grocery store maybe 50 times, read hundreds of books, had 7ish girlfriends, learned to speak italian, graduated from college, and ran around naked.</description>

      <description>oh yea. so stability, unrest and insanity are all ways to describe my current feelings. basically nothing is making sense and everything is all screwed up.
the new zealand people are at it again - or something. LAME. and super super annoying. i hate money.
i think i am about to go through some rather large changes. it should be interesting. and retarded. i am not excited. well wait i am excited - but i wish that i was in control rather than not in control.</description>

i went ahead and watched casshern. it is incredible. one of the weirdest movies i have seen in awhile. totally insane. it is about this dude who dies and then gets reborn - and his arch enemy - a bioexperiment gone wrong.</description>

hopefully this will rule - we could have a huge trackback club. and more people will se our blogs. MORE MORE MORE. then i will have to make blogs.nata2.org fancy. i imagine i will attempt to use javascript and ajax to make it rule.</description>

      <description>So i have been ordering from hivizone, a hong kong asian cinema store, for about 4 years now. and they send via speedpost - which eventually turns into USPS. well. goddamn USPS always makes receiving packages a nightmare. so for the second time in the last six months i have placed an order with hivizone and USPS leaves an attempt of delivery notice. So i fill it out appropriately and leave it.</description>

I really feel like i am desecrating all that is holy by using wordpress. for some reason i feel that writing all my own software is the way to go - although this is really nice and fancy. i do like the features. but i hate some of the more commercial parts. stupid commercial.</description>

I needed a way to view what keywords woudl display what ads with Google&#39;s incredible adsense tool. However - I didn&#39;t really like the adnse preview tool for IE. it was annoying for some reason. so I did some poking about and made this. the ads displayed are using the test flag with no client id specified. so no one is getting ripped off.</description>

      <description>I am rather sleepy. tonight/today was good. I coded all day in anticipation of my new tool being released. I am excited. unfortunantly all my work is going to be looked at as sketchy - cuz the competitor released their &amp;quot;upgrade&amp;quot; which is significantly better than what they had, and rather similar to what I have done. doh! I guess I have to redo and make mine a lot better. ahh.</description>

      <description>where the deer and the antelope play. where seldom is heard a discouraging word. and the eyes eat cowboys all day. Oh yea. it is the weekend. I am soooo sleepy. I am going to have a meet and greet. and then have a meet and sleep. and then WHAMO. saturday. then sunday. then work. wooohooo
in the mean time I am going to attempt to hook howtoyoyo into mambo as well as audreyhacking - hopefully by putting all my sites into one CMS I will have a quicker workflow for chanegs and such.</description>

Some really exciting things are going down right now. I am almost finished with my fathers site and should be moving on to another couple sites. I started another project and have bundles more to do. stupid projects. always taking my time. one of the cooler projects I started is a port of the bbs door cripple smash.</description>

      <description>So as everyone knows - paris hilton&#39;s phonebook was &amp;quot;hacked.&amp;quot; it seems to me that it was gained through social engineering. and that social engineering was nothing more than someone calling up paris and asking for her tmobile password. probably something along the lines of:
hacker: Hi. I am operator #123 from T-Mobile. There has been a service interuption and I need to verify your account ID and Password to restore your acconut.</description>

I saw lots of cool friends. sadly tomorrow is work. hey all my far away friends (i.e. bec, miriam and ella) I am now on skype - you should &amp;quot;skype me&amp;quot; - or call - or whatever. I hooked my bluetooth headset up to my mini mac and now have a fanciful &amp;quot;voipish&amp;quot; internet phone.</description>

      <description>contrary to the usual circumstances - I did not go out tonight. weird I know. but I am trying to knock out this website. I would say I am about 80% done. which is good. I did about 40% today. which is also good. so if I don&amp;rsquo;t sleep all day tomorrow I will be able to knock the rest out. one thing I did today that rules - is generate pdf files with php.</description>

      <description>heh. check out my new design. it is almost done. I need to fancy it up a bit and tweak it a little bit. but for the most part it is near completion.  also check out 43 things - a really really cool idea. I think I will integrate it with my new blog design. I also want to make a friends section like nick whatever&amp;rsquo;s blog - which I don&amp;rsquo;t want to find right now.</description>

      <description>this is an excellent write up on the incredible google maps. the most important thing he says is:  I also think it bears noting that Google is pulling out all the stops to build rich web apps, no matter how weirdly they have to hack the browser to make them go. And I strongly believe that this is a trend that is here to stay &amp;ndash; XHTML Strict/CSS/etc be damned.</description>

      <description>i have accidently slept every night until about 1 for the past 3 days. I come home from work and &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; a book and then wake up in the middle of the night. tonight I caught myself and woke up at 11:45. wheee.i am reading these insane fantasy novels that matiss lent me. I don&amp;rsquo;t usually like fantasy nobels - however these are incredible. they are called the &amp;ldquo;vlad taltos&amp;rdquo; books - the first being called &amp;ldquo;jhereg&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So on new years day i got a little “carried away” and got my Nokia 6600 wet. The joystick immediately stopped working and all hell broke loose. i was unable to do anything fancy like call or text. it was so annoying. so i got out my nifty little Sony-Ericcson t610 and continued my day. luckily mightysync worked for me and i didn’t lose any number nor was i down for any time.</description>

      <description>So i got one of those free ipod minis. It was stupid, those are such scams. it took a long time - cuz i didn&amp;#8217;t really care. but seriously. it isn&amp;#8217;t worth doing. you might as well just save your money and buy one. odn&amp;#8217;t get me wrong - it is free. but you are inadvertently selling out your fiends in the process. ;) I also picked up a mac mini.</description>

      <description>so I got my mac mini. it came during my last blog entry. I was excited. of course. apple had to pack it all nice and such. I appreciate how minimal apples packaging is. although - it has become rather predictable. but is that bad? predictable packaging. it is not very big. i like the back. and I dislike the gargantuan powe supply. so dumb. &amp;hellip;more pictures laters. oh oh oh.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; alt=&#34;Ibook Picture Frame&#34; src=&#34;http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3842.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted a digital picture frame. I originally thought that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.audreyhacking.com&#34;&gt;audrey &lt;/a&gt; would fulfill my need - but it became apparent that i needed something much more powerful. I needed something that i could manage remotely and could run reasonable programs on. I needed a technology that would allow me to use open source software to display and manipulate the pictures as well as possible. I thought of using a custom linux solution - but decided that it would be cost prohibitive. I also noticed that there are a handfull of good picture frame tutorials already on the internet - so i checked them out and noticed a really nice powerbook &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.applefritter.com/node/view/4971&#34;&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.applefritter.com/hacks/duodigitalframe/index.html&#34;&gt;apple duo&lt;/a&gt; hack and got to thinking about my roommates old clamshell ibook sitting in the corner&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>happy xmas.
i made my photo frame ibook work. it rules. I just mounted it into a picture frame shadow box, and BAM. fanciness. it rules that you can remove EVERYTHING from an ibook and still have it function properly. hehe</description>

I will have more pictures of my HOLIDAY plans later. if you want to come to my new years party - go ahead and shoot me a message.</description>

      <description>work is fun. however for the past 12 hours - my sternum has felt like it needed to be &amp;ldquo;popped.&amp;rdquo; like a back. it sucks. it kinda hurts when I breath. I hope I am not dieing. heh. today I am not a fan of Harry Angstrom. I am annoyed at how hard he is on his son. me and my friends have been playing media mammon maniacally. it rules. basically you pick words to trade on a market - but the market value of each word is detirmined by the density of that word in the news.</description>

      <description>so I have been reading the rabbit series of books by john updike. they are pretty good. I started with &amp;ldquo;rabbit redux&amp;rdquo; and just finished &amp;ldquo;rabbit, run&amp;rdquo; last night. after I finished &amp;ldquo;rabbit, run&amp;rdquo; I immediately started &amp;ldquo;rabbit is rich.&amp;rdquo; anyway. I have been thinking about rabbit and what I like/dislike about him in these books. well I don&amp;rsquo;t really like him in &amp;ldquo;rabbit, run&amp;rdquo; - I think he is obviously the anti-hero, a destroyer; however I do like him in &amp;ldquo;rabbit redux.</description>

      <description>i think the mix is grave diggaz, front line assembly, himsa, bleeding through and fischerspooner. haha. it rules. it is also a lot better on shuffle. ;) I love mp3s. last night all I did was play video games. I played gish for about an hour - it is a lot of fun. I enjoyed the motif quite a bit. I do wish it really looked like the still graphics look.</description>

      <description>seriously. it is a crazy mess. it just exploded the other day and I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance or drive to fix it. so the ipod mini is incredible. so tiny. it really is awesome. as you can see it is quite a bit smaller than the regular ipod. it came with the crappy generic white apple headphones. I was hopeing for the fancy smancy in ear ones. but noooo&amp;hellip; it did however come with a really nifty belt clip.</description>

      <description>i was playing around with my blog software and I noticed something pretty cool. I have taken over 1000 pictures with my nokia cell phone cam and have roughly 2525 pictures total in my photolog. I have taken pictures of a bunch of neat stuff. it is pretty cool. I have wanted to make a view that is the text from the blog and the pictures all in one fancy view.</description>

      <description>i know I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated in a while. do you think you can forgive me? I hope so. we all go through times where computers burn our fingers when we touch them. this wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of those times. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it. sometimes that happens. but whatever. I am back. for tonight. maybe for a couple days. maybe for a couple months. maybe for just a minute.  but whatever.</description>

      <description>seriously I do. my new goal (well it is the same as my old goal - but with a bit more randomness) is awkwardness, juxtoposition and hyperbole. so basiclaly my life. hah. but I am excited. for the next couple days. work is becoming ultra cool. I think their will be some nice changes soon. it just seems like their will be. like the wind is blowing change my way. I do think it is funny - I could be the veritable harbinger of death and sorrow for developers - for I have never worked anywhere where as soon as I get hired the lead developer doesn&amp;rsquo;t quit.</description>

I just buzzed around and had time traveling problems. I am currently reading this book by authur c clarke. it rules. I forgot what it is called.

I got this new job. it is taking a lot of my time. it rules. but I am in a different paradigm than I was when I was at the WB. basically I am totally engaged for 8 hours.

      <description>omfg. so that sucked. it was pretty harrowing to watch unfold. I mean. it appeared that we didn&amp;rsquo;t even have a chance. and then I started drinking. which made the whole thing rediculous. I am now sleepy from drinking too much with too little food and too little consideration for reality. all I remember is laying on my bed and calling for my friends. then wooosh - morning. heh. and then we get bush for another four years.</description>

      <description>however, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel very tired. I really don&amp;rsquo;t understand how it is that I am able to lead this weird dual life. my friend adam equated it to the original mods from the 50s and 60s. he said they used to have normal jobs(working 9-5) and look like business people - then after work they would transform into these fashion seeking scene people. right after my friend adam told me this he started shouting &amp;ldquo;prolatariet.</description>

      <description>i have no idea whats going on. none I apparently broke my blog software and it isn&amp;rsquo;t allowing me to post. of this makes any sense. maybe its time.ok I figured it out. basically the new php.ini was all &amp;ldquo;secure&amp;rdquo; and such and removed the magic quotes. so my app - which submitted my entries to a db needed to cleansed with the addslashes() function. w00t. my applications from 2001 are failing.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I got my OGO in the mail today and have been using it on and off all day. It is a pretty cool device. Unfortunantly (as any new device) it has some pretty annoying bits to it. I will give a basic rundown of the features as i see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OGO is basically a device meant to hit the market of “kids” who are texting, instant messaging and emailing a lot. the point between a two way and a sidekick. the back of the box says “This is Ogo. It does IM, it does e-mail, it does text. All in one. All at once. Any time, any place - in your hand, on the bus, at the beach, at home, at large. You don’t need a computer, you don’t need a wire. You get the message. Send word. And welcome to the Ogosphere.” omg. so that is the gest  of it. hah.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>again. BAM sucka. I feel I should post something awesome to make up for my lame complaining last post. I guess I will give it a shot. this car is pretty dope. it woudl be fun. a super mini hybrid.

      <description>i totally didn&amp;rsquo;t know that my blog was public. haha. jk. so I was talking to my friend and she relayed information that my blog was the topic of a conversation in a meeting about rss feeds. I was used to demonstrate how &amp;ldquo;people need to keep in mind that anybody can read what you post.&amp;rdquo; this was apparently especially true in light of my post about me resigning. well. first off.</description>

It all started last wednesday. tommie called me to alert me of his presence and invite me to scissor sisters. that ruled. we hung out then. and then we went to crobar and I broke myself. i hadn&amp;rsquo;t been feeling good. so I stayed in bed friday. then went to my final interview around 5ish on friday. I receieved and accepted my offer and happily went to the paper magazine party at marshall fields.</description>

      <description>i really want to go dancing - big band style. all of a sudden. or just watch triplets of belleville. something. just not be up or at work. I am tired of wearing &amp;ldquo;business casual&amp;rdquo; clothing. I really want to just wear jeans. or whatever. just something that isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;business casual.&amp;rdquo; I suppose I will get over it. ;) I go through these feelings once every couple months and I usually get over it.</description>

      <description>haha. so this weekend was pretty ridiculous. it was generally out of control. basically I just hung out and did the things that make my life incredible. haha. it all started on Wednesday (of course).  so for the past couple weeks I have been working nights a lot. so I have also had a LOT of screwed up sleep - i.e. none. especially at night. soo&amp;hellip; on Wednesday I was struggling with attempting to not stay up all night - so I hung out at home and though about sleeping.</description>

      <description>so my friend from work, lakshmi, is leaving on monday to go back to india. it is kinda sad. she is one of my favorite coworkers. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t realize it was truely happening until I read her entry about work and the disengagement from sait work. apparently I swear. but it is kinda weird to think about. because it is so different from another coworker leaving or a friend moving - because she is going to india.</description>

      <description>today was pretty fun. I worked. wore a tie. etc etc. it was nifty. and now I am really pretty tired. I need to get off of this crazy crazy schedule. I really dispise and hate it. i picked up an airport express. it is relly pretty cool. I like what I am abl eto do with it. especially the streaming of music. that is really really cool. I can&amp;rsquo;t really think of anything cooler.</description>

      <description>so I left work at 4:40 and I was just walkign across the outside by my work minding my own business when I notice that this dude is having sex wiht some lady like 5 feet away. I look away, mumble &amp;ldquo;my bad&amp;rdquo; and walk a bit faster away. really really really weird. they just stared at me while I walked by. it was very strange. right on the concrete benches outside of my work.</description>

      <description>seriously. it is pretty annoying. however I have a totally sweet setup for passing time. unfortunantly I am unable to pass the time - because the stupid tests are not working.</description>

      <description>it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. having a crazy scedule where you are up from 11 to 6 and sleep from 6 to 9 and then are up from 9 until 6 is insane. it creates ghosts in my head. I was hanging out at work yesterday morning - about 24hrs ago - and I thought I heard voices calling my name. I scurried off home. full of fear of zombies and demons. it ruled.</description>

      <description>Today is weird. I worked from 9 to 5 twice in 24 hours. That is a lot of work. I am totally of the school of thought that you should always pace yourself. 16 hours with a 3 hour break isn&amp;rsquo;t really pacing myself. But whatever - it is the same sxhedule I sometimes have with going out and work - and I don&amp;rsquo;t complain then. Heh.
Today I got a letter from my friend ella from taiwan.</description>

      <description>last night was entertaining. I was planning on working at 12 - but then I call my coworker and she was like &amp;ldquo;oh no - you don&amp;rsquo;t have to work&amp;rdquo; - so I went out. then when I got home. india called and was like - &amp;ldquo;everything isn&amp;rsquo;t working how it is supposed to work&amp;rdquo; so I had to do a bunch of stuff until around 3:30. heh. then I slept until 10.</description>

      <description>so my computer broke. so I tested all the parts I could and detirmined that it is the power supply. which totally sucks. so I have to get a new one. this woudln&amp;rsquo;t be that big of deal - but my laptop is also down. I somehow broke tcp/ip on it. totally blown. so I am stuck booting knoppix on the laptop and using my desktop keyboard, mouse and monitor with it.</description>

      <description>this is dumb. heh. BREAKING THE LAW!! this weekend was pretty fun. I got my hair severly cut on friday. no more mullet, rattail or peyos. sad day. but is is a nice change. I am happy about it. I also got some color as well so it is all good. I really like it. it did take some getting used to - as I had that haircut for almost 2 years and I had the peyos for like 6 years.</description>

      <description>i have been away. oh yes. I have been away. i got to buffalo on wednesday night. dylan arrived shortly after I did and we went to the renegade show at this really awesome space called sphere. The renegade show was pretty awesome - mark faje was really funny as the MC and really made the renegade show what it is &amp;ldquo;supposed to be.&amp;rdquo; so then we went to our hotel - where we expected to be greated by a multiple room suite - only to find a one room one bed space for 6 men.</description>

WARNING. it is REALLY REALLY rough. but it will be a lot better soon. we are gunna give it the &amp;ldquo;treatment.&amp;rdquo; basically it is a webserver that listens to a pre desposed port and servers a static page. this page takes from it whatever song is currently playign in itunes and displays it. it also displays some real quick buttons to navigate through the current playlists.</description>

Basically i haven&amp;#8217;t engaged in anything mobile technology at all - which is annoying. i need to play more. matiss just got a phone with a camera. so i imagine i will be creating a simple way to do a photoblog for him. i hope anyway it will go well. i really need to acquire or figure out how to quickly get a sms gateway.</description>

Basically i haven&amp;rsquo;t engaged in anything mobile technology at all - which is annoying. i need to play more. matiss just got a phone with a camera. so i imagine i will be creating a simple way to do a photoblog for him. i hope anyway it will go well. i really need to acquire or figure out how to quickly get a sms gateway.</description>

      <description>so today over lunch I decided it would be a good idea to import my old email into gmail. it rules. check out the tool that I am using. written by mark lyon. it works pretty well - albeit very slow. but whatever. I will just have it go in the background. my server has a lot of bandwidth. seriously. this  is pretty bad. i have listened to twisted sister&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;burn in hell&amp;rdquo; a billion times today and it isn&amp;rsquo;t getting very old.</description>

      <description>this weekend was awesome. on thursday I hung out with a dope friend - we got dinner and drinks - it was pretty nice. I went home for a quick stop to say hi to my friends who were staying and then went to crobar - where a bunch of friends were. we somehow made it to vips. hahah. whatever. ;) then I went to bed. I find it pretty weird that I consider thursday the beginning of the weekend.</description>

It all started on thrusday. oh yea. crobar. we all hung out. hiromi was drinking a little more than she usually does so that was hilarious.</description>

      <description>so this day has been weird already and it is barely 9:30. first last night I got home from juggling club and was notified that my paypal account was terminated due to 3gscreensaver having porn on it. I actually don&amp;rsquo;t know if that was the reason they just sent me a terse email with this link. so I am assuming - unless they think save chris or we own the sun is &amp;ldquo;mature&amp;rdquo; - it has to be 3gscreensaver.</description>

I am pretty happy with it. it seems to be a nice bike - other than the weird candy cane paint job.</description>

      <description>so I got a gmail account. it is pretty dope. a completely different way to use email. it is kinda crazy. I don&amp;rsquo;t like that you cannot import your old mail. and that you don&amp;rsquo;t have folders. but the tagging and such really revolutionizes email. it is pretty nuts. I want to give invites to some friends though. so I guess I am gunna have to wait. stupid google and its fancy way of doing things.</description>

      <description>hehe. this weekend was an incredible experiment in what I can take - mostly in regards to sleep deprevation - but also in regards to alcohol poisoning. which is really something I am not exactly proud of - but it was a lot of fun. so it all started on thrusday. me and some friends went to a smartbar party - and then to crobar. I had to try out my new &amp;ldquo;drop my name and you can get into crobar for free&amp;rdquo; trick (seriously - on thursdays just say your there to see harper reed - it should work).</description>

      <description>Ok Ok. so I have been reading Anna Karenina. It is amazing. seriously - possibly one of the better books I have ever read. I am fascinated with how thorough Tolstoy covers the story. and how the story seemingly covers everything. it is soo good. I love the feeling of want that is associated with reading a good book.. right now I feel that the only thing that could satisfy my want is to go home and read that book - or write a web app to do fancy things with itunes.</description>

      <description>recently apple released a pretty good COM sdk for its itunes program. my friend ajc created some sample code that would post whatever song you are listening to currently to a webpage. I found this pretty cool. and quite handy. so I implement my own version and BAM. if you notice at the bottom of my page (below the del.ico.us links) I have a listing of the most recent 5 songs I have listened to.</description>

      <description>as the weekend approaches.. I will be engaging in another weekend long sabbatical from the internet. but this time it will be a theoretical four days with a 1 day disappearing act when I come back. so you should send me crazy messages to my phone(thanks to those that sent me messages the past couple days), which will probably be on for the duration of the trip. tonight it look sas though I will be involved in a talent show with my yoyo.</description>

      <description>so last night vinay and myself hung around bangalore and went to different catholic churches. I met his wife and his mother and we just chilled out. it was nice and relaxing. I was in bed by 10 and asleep by 10:15. hah. the churches were pretty cool. they are all very majestic and quite something. it was as I expected - a mix of indian and western stylings. vinay&amp;rsquo;s favorite was the best one.</description>

      <description>so today lunch ;) we went to a nice place called the green park. it was fun. the whole team came - which was nice. I like hanging out with them. they are all so nice and it is (of course) nice to finally put faces to all the people I have worked with over the last couple years. so now I am uploading the pictures. I am afraid it is going to take forever.</description>

      <description>last night my friends and I went to this pretty nice resturant and had excellent food and free beer. the night was advertised as &amp;ldquo;unlimited intoxication&amp;rdquo; - which seemeingly is a misnomer. what does misnomer mean? so we hung out there and I had excellent tandori chicken kabobs and lotsa fish. it all ruled oh so much. good good food. then suresh and I went to a club called spin. apparently there is only about 50 things globally that you are allowed to call a club.</description>

      <description>yesterday and last nigth was pretty fun. guru, siddu and myself all went around bangalore again. this time we hung out in a very popular and modern area with lots of shops. I went to this great little shop that had some nice sandlewood and such. it was all very nice but really expensive. so I lost money in that gamble. and probably yall gained some gifts ;). I then purchased a swatch watch(mainly cuz I have NO idea what time it is and when I landed I was confused for days) and I got some bangels for my lady friends (if they are not mean like some (heh)).</description>

      <description>the whole thing is so strange. I think I coudl say that right now I am experiencing some of the strangest emotions and experiences I have had in awhile. mostly due to work, india, morgan, friends, general life, real estate, money. yea know. the good stuff. all that stuff just creates such anxiety in my life. it is so so weird. however, as confusing as it is, it isn&amp;rsquo;t bad. in fact a lot of it is good.</description>

      <description>but I did manage to arrive to work at a decent time. not the 4:00 I feared while attempting to fall asleep last night at 4:00am. I don&amp;rsquo;t look well rested. heh. hopefully in a couple minutes/hours/days. haha. I need a nap. already. and I barely got up a couple minutes ago. heh. a movie was being filmed on the way to work today. it was pretty crazy. mostly cuz all of a sudden there was a billion people on my way to work.</description>

      <description>after writing to myself on here. haha. now sleep is the next bet. I do think it is funny. how you can talk yourself down from stuff. especially funny is how my talking myself down is posting my feelings which are inside of me to a public web page. haha. I rule the new school. obviously. blog privacy/public dynamics are very interesting and I think need further investigation. I would like to study these topics one day.</description>

      <description>i hate feelings. I hate how small things can cause such weird reverberations within my self. it is hard. I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep. it hasn&amp;rsquo;t anything to do with anything. I just lay down. and I look at the ceiling. and I get kinda sad. not really depressed or pointedly sad. just a sinking feeling. like. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is going on in my head. but I do know. it isn&amp;rsquo;t really all that weird.</description>

      <description>tonight was good. I hung out with morgan a bunch. it was pretty weird. honestly. very strange. but it was also great. it is pretty strange - cuz we didn&amp;rsquo;t break up with an absolute reason. it just didn&amp;rsquo;t work out. so. are feelings are pretty much intact. just 3.5 weeks detatched. so yea. it was relaly great to see her and hang out. she hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed in the couple weeks.</description>

      <description>tonight I am going to dinner with morgan. it is kinda weird. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen her since we broke up. I am a bit apprenhensive - not really about seeing her. just about the whole situation. it is kinda scary. haha. I am glad, however that it is scary by design and not scary or uncomfortable because I happened to run in to her randomly. we have been talking on email - so it shoudln&amp;rsquo;t be too uncomfortable.</description>

      <description>today I went downtown and picked up voltage converter and some clothes. everyone has been telling me to go and get light colored clothing so that I don&amp;rsquo;t A) burn up and B) get attacked by bugs. apparently there are a lot of bugs. I am not a fan of disease so I guess I will head their suggestions. stupid disease. so I got some clothes. mostly brown pants and nice blue and white shirts.</description>

I hung out with cole and my friend kelly who bartends at metro. it was pretty fun. cole and I haven&amp;rsquo;t hung out in a long couple months. I missed him. it was nice to get back into the swing of things. fot the most part I feel pretty weird right now. I wish I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that way. I am totally missing morgan.</description>

      <description>the last couple days have been pretty weird. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like posting at all. which is in itself pretty different. usually I post as a decompression activity - or because I want to say something. however in the last couple days I have really felt that my motivations for posting on my &amp;lsquo;blog&amp;rsquo; were not exactly legit. hah. they were not really illegal - just not necessarily in the same vein as the motivations that usually power a post.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;a lot of people have been having a hard time getting MMS and WAP to work with the nokia 6600. however. a while ago tmobile upgraded their system and now it works. basically it is all the same except for the addition of a proxy server. so you can either add the proxy server info to your current config or you can add whole new connections using the correct info provided.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>i can&amp;rsquo;t seem to sleep. I mean. I did take a nap from 10:00-12:00 haha. it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much as a nap as much as it was an alcohol enforced sleep. heh. the plan was to have all of our friends meet us at the bar that is really close to my house. it worked very well. we got there around 4:30 and left around 8:00. we had pizza there and bunchs of tequila shots.</description>

      <description>so my l33t skills didn&amp;rsquo;t work out today. I totally screwed up my servers. well not really. I am not on my new servers yet. I had to leave my old server in colo - which costs me a lot more money, and I had to use the switch- so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to return it. it sucks. I am pretty pissed/upset. mostly cuz I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to pull it off.</description>

      <description>This weekend was good. on friday there was a blond redhead show. I was initially a bit scared that they woudn&amp;rsquo;t represent their recorded music well - but I was wrong. they did a great job. as soon as the women started singing, it was apparent that her talent wasn&amp;rsquo;t based on some studio tricks. after the concert I went and hung out a bit with morgn and alan. then sleep.</description>

      <description>i was complaining about not having a really solid way to upload images from my phone to my server. I was using my MMS to photolog script, which totally worked good. but I needed a way to get ALL of the pictures from my camera to my server without havign to bluetooth them and then ftp them and then move them. so I found this php nokia image server , configured it, rewrote a bit of it.</description>

      <description>and freaked out a bit. I finally calmed down and found out that it will all be ok. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t freaking out about anything in particular. just freaking out. more of a nervous situation than anything. it was pretty weird. it is funny when you create scenerios in your head and they matter SOOO much - yet 15 minutes later you are like.. &amp;ldquo;ehh whatever.&amp;rdquo; basically I woke up, went home, saw that my servers where blowing up.</description>

      <description>so I sent my boss notice today that I will be taking friday the 9th of april off. this means that I am officially upgrading my servers in the near future. this increases the stress level and my need to work. ;) no more hanging out. haha. well a little hanging out. it won&amp;rsquo;t take that much time really. I magically and with great luck configured my other box so upgrading should (should) be pretty straight forward.</description>

      <description>tonight was nice. we played games. ate some food. hung out. it was nice. I finally got to spend time with all my friends - in a more chill out way. it was nice. I am tired. but in that &amp;ldquo;i slept until 1ish&amp;rdquo; sort of way. I need to sleep. get up. unfortunantly goto work. and do lots of work. then I will get food. hang out with carl. hang out with morgan.</description>

      <description>so this weekend has been nice. on friday my coworkers and myself went to the hard rock cafe bar and met my friend winnie for drinks. she works there and was able to hook us up a bit which offset the billion dollars the drinks normally would have cost. it was a nice place. pretty chilled out - however around 5:30 - it started to get pretty full and crazy. after that I went and picked up some buttons at busy beaver.</description>

      <description>i just hate the fact that I am unable to use MMS. i seriously need to save my money. I am always running out of money. wtf. I guess my fasion lifestyle I established when I was a baller doesn&amp;rsquo;t transcend well to the non-baller status I am currently exhibiting. doh! or lack there of. :(i say this rant as I prepare to go out to sushi and a super (hah) club with my friends later.</description>

      <description>makes me really happy. although there is nothing I hate more than to walk to work in the rain. hah. well hate is a rather STRONG word. I like the rain a lot actually. I just don&amp;rsquo;t like getting ready for work and then getting wet. normality is near!
i am a magic man!i made a writeup about my ibook picture frame project.</description>

      <description>i feel better. even matt said I looked and acted more chilled out. I really feel more chilled out. morgan and I talked and came to a point where we are in the same space/place. I think it will work out. we obviously have to redefine our relationship. and how we work together. but that is totally fine and completely appropriate. I think she said it best with an analogy to the gears in a car.</description>

      <description>i was able to fix my photolog in like 3 minutes. it worked out FINE. hah. the pictures from the phone are 640x480 so quite a bit bigger than the previous demensions. however. I think the next step will be hooking GD into the photolog software to create thumbnails. heh. I think it will be worth it. and it will rule. RULE I say. i am able to bypass MMS and use the email client on the phone to send the images.</description>

I also ordered some of his work. nice work. that is. i am feeling very weird. my conversation with morgan last night gave me some much needed hope. but it also stirred all my emotions up into a mess of colors.</description>

      <description>so I am going to make a post not on that topic. doh!  so morgan picked me up a copy of the economist. the cover is seriously the best thing ever. I think I might subscribe. I also want to subscribe to a military journal as well. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what. probably something rather conservative. something like janes - but on paper. and then maybe Mother Jones. oh and harpers (have you noticed how almost everything named harper rules?</description>

      <description>well. basically I feel right now that when you get down it is pretty easy to look up. I just had a meeting. it was really dumb. I stopped listening months ago. hah. just kidding ;) I stopped listening soemtime in the meeting. and then realized that they were talking about something I needed to listen to . so I attempted to replay what had happaned in my mind. it was hard.</description>

      <description>so I came to work. it was nice to go outside. I guess moving is good. although it was tough leaving the comfort (and depression) of my room - it is worth it to be out of the realm of my wallowing. i listened to the butthole surfers on the way to work. hairway to steven. such a great album. hah. and then the cars. how did the cars do that.</description>

      <description>so last night after morgan left I felt pretty good. like. &amp;ldquo;ok this will be fine. I understand. it is all good. I look forward to being her friend.&amp;rdquo; today. I wake up. it is not easier. it is not fun. I really don&amp;rsquo;t want this to be happening. honestly. I am really sad. I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to goto work. I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to hang out. I look to checking my email in case she sent me one.</description>

      <description>well morgan and I talked. it was kinda hard. but at the same time. it made things a lot better. closure is always good. i wish it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really this way however. but whatever. we will get along well. and it will work out - however it needs to work out.</description>

      <description>today was kinda rough. morgan and I had a discussion last night that ended with our pretty much breaking up. it sucks quite a bit. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t mean for this to happen. and I don&amp;rsquo;t really know if she did either. but I am also not sure if it is something that is reconciliable or if it is just a situation that sucks and will not become &amp;ldquo;fixed.&amp;rdquo; the reasons are all valid, and rational.</description>

I am probably going to sleep a lot. maybe goto dinner. nobody knows. i need some rest. it was an eventful and unrestful night. i am kinda sad.</description>

      <description>so I went and got accupuncture last night. I think I am done for a bit. I originally went to alleviate some back pain I had gained from wrestling - however the back pain is gone. so wheni arrived yesterday I realized that I really had know ailments for her to manipulate. I was perfect. so the session ended up just being weird and boring I mean.. it isn&amp;rsquo;t really suppsoed to be entertaining - but I got tired of it and was suddenly done.</description>

      <description>So today some terrorists in the basque region of spain blew up a bunch of commuter trains during rush hour. this is after the E.T.A. declared a cease fire on the caralina region of spain - so apparently the terrosist actions are now concentrated on madrid and the like. i know so little about the france/spain/basque conflict that I am very confused. it is interesting to read the reactions of the internet to such a horrible terrorist act.</description>

I hate trusting vendors with more than 50 dollars. yeah yeah yeah. this weekend was a good time. it created a tired person out of me however. on friday jon arrived. we all hung out and chilled. ate food. and then helled about chicago - ending up at tobias&amp;rsquo; place.</description>

      <description>after walking to work. I noticed that I generally feel pretty good - in regards to the stiffness and all the reasons I went to accupuncture. that seems pretty cool. on the elevator up to work there was a sign on the thirteenth floor that had a biohazard symbol and a birthday cake. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to read it - I was confused by the combination of those icons. maybe not so much confused as I was worried.</description>

      <description>so my accupunture last night was cool. it strangely seemed to effect my mood - which I was not quite ready for. I was totally a irrational, tired and emotional mess. haha. but I knew it while it was happening - so I just acted weird a couple times and was mostly quiet. I wonder if it was the actual accupunture that put me into a funk or if it was just the fact that I was tired and the pushing myself to be stronger , faster, and better.</description>

      <description>so I am reading beowulf (or is it this). it is interesting to read for fun what I once rejected reading for school. however it really brings me back to all the discussions we had about the text. sometimes literary critique is fun. other times i hate it. 
i am going to get a new website. probably with these guys - maybe plan 3. I really want a terrantula. I LOVE spiders.</description>

      <description>I woke up and attempted my hardest to not make it to work. however, much to my chagrin, I now find myself at work. on the way in - I listened to midnight oil&amp;rsquo;s diesel and dust. I have been listening to music from my past lately. it is pretty fun. yesterday I purchased a bunch of crosby and nash and then a bunch of neil young. both are so so good.</description>

      <description>A week and a half ago chris saathoff was killed by a drunk driver. It is pretty sad (of course) - but watching his blog stop and his friends react. the news story is rather sad as well. sometimes it is strange living in the city. with all the crap that goes on.. the gangs, the violence that is around us but &amp;ldquo;not&amp;rdquo; affecting us. wtf. it is dumb.</description>

      <description>a couple minutes ago I was almost.. wait.. I was hit by a car. it was going very very slow. but it totally made contact with my body. luckily it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going fast - as I would be dead. hehe. it ruled. then my coworkers made fun of me for being an internet only person. I think the quote was &amp;ldquo;basketball, one of the things you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know about cuz it isn&amp;rsquo;t on the internet.</description>

      <description>i was so weird yesterday. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be at work. so I just did my work without mentioning a word to anyone - and I reacted poorly when I was spoken too. it was annoying even to me.. I guess I was coming down from the high of my awesome (and tiring) weekend. I just wanted to go home and get a hug from someone. or go home and sleep (which is essentially what I did).</description>

      <description>last night morgan and I watched night and fog - a really good documentary on the horrors of the german concentration camps in europe during world war II. It was the first time I had seen actual movie footage of all the bodies and such. it was quite haunting. I am not a fan of genocide. I thought that the end of the documentary was quite appropriate - with the message that the enemy is &amp;ldquo;us.</description>

      <description>So.. a friend of mine messaged me and was rather freaked out by the fact that a online celebrity RPG was stalking her. heh. I did a bit of research and I noticed that the entire kill hannah group is enveloped in this stupid internet false world. hehe. weird. sometimes the world is insane. INSANE I say. what are peoples fascination with death in june and boyd rice. why is it that people will defend these bands as not being racist, fascist, misanthropic or generally skinhead-ish.</description>

      <description>so this weekend was pretty fun. on friday I hung out with morgan and we went to a art opening at my friend lenores gallery. the opening was fun - but the hanging out was really good. after this event, we went to a party where a pinata filled with cayan pepper was exploded prior to our arrival. it was rather abrasive on my poor nasal passage ;). we hung out here and drank rather rough gin drinks until we got hungry enough to leave.</description>

I was pretty sure at that point that my life was going to get weird, so as any good boy would do - I just gave in and drank a lot more mt. dew. so what happened was this. we (WB) went live with this product on wednesday night.</description>

      <description>So I got my sidekick last night - and it has already proven to be a good deal. I got it through a place called simplycells.com for around $79 with activation and rebates. but I just added it to my current tmobile account and got a new number for it. I removed the voice minutes and just have it for data. so it is only about 29/month. which is pretty dope.</description>

      <description>it is true. recently a google employees side/personal project relaly took off. orkut is honestly what I felt friendster could have been . it doesn&amp;rsquo;t limit communication to on site. it lets you see the contact info for all your friends and maintain some form of community without limiting yourself to some shoddy infrastructure. I really like how you can create sub groups among your friends, create/be apart of a larger overall subgroup and rate your friends.</description>

      <description>my shirt is causing my neck to turn red. usually this isn&amp;rsquo;t a good thing. but today it is awesome. !!! i got up so early today. it is weird to be up so damn early. nobody is out and around - but somehow I still managed to come to work barely by nine. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand how this works. I leave my house anywhere from 8-8:30ish and get here everyday at nine.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t often go but in light of seeing my family get sick and then better I decided awhile ago that I woudl take a more proactive approach to my health. which.. may or may not involve moving a bit more - I think moving is stupid.my weekend effects have yet to peak:

      <description>So on Thursday night - I accidentally went and bought some clothes. It was ridiculous. I should never be allowed in to certain far too expensive stores. However I got a hot pair of pants.. not a pair of hot pants mind you.. but yea. So I gotta return some stuff and keep some stuff. I really can?t deal with pants without belt loops ? I just feel insane when I am not wearing a belt.</description>

      <description>so a couple days a go I really screwed up my photolog. it sucked - because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that I had screwed it up until I lost a bunch of picture that morgan took when I was insane. now they are gone forever. how sad. but anyway.. it is now fixed. I figured it out - basically when I was cleaning out nata2.info I inadvertently changed the permissions on the dir that the photolog puts the photos in.</description>

      <description>staying up for work is killing me. haha. even thought it was a couple days ago. I obviously need to take this weekend and sleep in. when I just typed sleep. I thought I maybe mispelled it. and when I lookd and it was spelled right I was so confused - cuz I swore I spelled it with a lot of Ls and no Es. whatever. I hate keyboards. they are mean to me.</description>

      <description>i hate when you get on the train and it is slow. like really really slow. it is dumb. it just took me 6 times to spell that last &amp;ldquo;is.&amp;rdquo; that made me really mad. haha. I am totally not in the mood for things to exist on a plane that isn&amp;rsquo;t convienient or comfortable. last night I talked to patrick about getting some work done - and the size of the tattoo grew significantly.</description>

      <description>in fact I really didn&amp;rsquo;t do much. I honestly barely made it to work. but on;y because I was so tired from working last night. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the deal was.. I was dieing. I drank soo much pop and candy - I think I surpassed the point of it being helpfuland it became a method of sedation. stupid sedation. I am sitll in love however with wireless internet. so before any asks.</description>

      <description>so today I had a weird day at work. nothing happened - I just felt weird. so I went home and attempted to take a nap to relax myself. but that didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep. I needed to just screw around or hang out and say stupid shit to people. so I got matt and we walked to the local bar. it ruled. we drank $20 worth of beer - which on an empty stomach is PLENTY.</description>

      <description>this is a long entry heh. I wish I really was a darksider. I have had some really weird dreams the past couple days. first I had a dream I was in a bad place. the place was a bed and the other person in the bed didn&amp;rsquo;t want me there but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t leave - so I was attempting to stay on the edge of the bed the whole night.</description>

Work has been interesting. a lot of drama and going forwards-ness. it is nice. finally stuff is getting done. but at the expense of a lot of comfortability and weird weird situations. anyway..On friday I came home and took a nap. I talked with ladawn a bunch on the phone which was awesome, she seems to be doing wonderful. I decided that my room is a complete mess, but I am going to have to deal with it :( - whatever.</description>

I am totally backwards and screwed up today. it is a pain. first off I locked myself out of my apartment.. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even ready to leave.. but I left.. then realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything but my cell phone.. so I was able to call and wake matiss to have him let me in.</description>

      <description>so the other day I decided to pick up a Jabra Freespeak bluetooth headset for my t610. When wearing it I feel as though I am in the future. I thought about getting the digital bluespoon but i felt bad paying more for the headset than i did for the phone. so i guess that will have to wait for when i get my 6600.
here is an awesome review of the bluespoon here is a poor review of the jabra</description>

      <description>so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep again. I ended up finishng the book I started - which is always a good feeling. I ended up starting a second book.. but I put it away with fear that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t I woudl finish it too and it would be 8 in the morning. I suppose this is one of those days where I coudl afford to not sleep. but it would really wear on me.</description>

      <description>and I have been thinking about merging them all into one of two sites. making all my personal sites have the same motif. making the blog have categories and importing all the old entries into a nifty category system. I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet. but I have been looking at some others and I noticed that a lot of them have incredible blogs.. and one of the reasons is you don&amp;rsquo;t have to jump all over the internet looking for something.</description>

I think tonight I am going to take the time to clean my messy room. eep. while I was showering today I thought how nice it would be to be able to have a shell on my desktop without ssh - so I almost convinced myself to buy a 12&amp;rdquo; powerbook.</description>

Hopefully he won&amp;rsquo;t be bored. Then we all went ice skating.. well we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually go ice skating - we went to an figure skating show.</description>

      <description>So my mobile phone fascination has reached a new height. I took some spare time in the last couple days and compiled a phon/mobile/technology blog. check it out here. Hopefully it will continue to foster exciting phone stuff for my head. and make me a million dollar bills.
i doodle a lot during meetings and such. sometimes I wonder if it is annoying - but I keep doing it cuz it keeps me on track and on task.</description>

      <description>So yesterday my fathers surgery went without a hitch and he now has a cyborg heart. it rules - mainly cuz his un-cyborg heart was full of badnesss so it would have not been so keen on working much longer. cyborg parents are all the rage I hear. So anyway.. he is doing great. almost all the tubes are out. and he is sleepy.it is weird though.. the move from immortal parents to immortal kids.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really like the idea of mobile blogging and haven&amp;rsquo;t been too keen on using my keypad to do an entry on my blog. A friend showed me his &lt;a href=&#34;http://bryan.textamerica.com/&#34;&gt;moblog&lt;/a&gt; that he made using his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html&#34;&gt;3650&lt;/a&gt; and i thought that it couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly be that hard to create a similar thing using the mms message sent from the phone. As far as i can tell - the mms message is composed of fancy headers and then the payload as an attachment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>On the LNP day last month i immediately ported from sprint to t-mobile. I had been with sprint for 4 years and was appreciative of their &amp;ldquo;3g&amp;rdquo; technology. but after gettgin completely screwed one too many times i decided to switch. I had a tough time figuring out which provider to go with, although i had narrowed the phone down to the t610.
I really liked the look and shape of the t610.</description>

      <guid>http://harper.blog/oldposts/2003-12-04-theming-the-t610/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;i recently experienced a painless switch from &lt;a href=&#34;http://3gcoding.com/archives/000006.php&#34;&gt;sprint to t-mobile&lt;/a&gt;. It ruled. and part of the divorce i ended up with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sonyericsson.com/t610/&#34;&gt;sony ericcson t610&lt;/a&gt;. so as any good person would.. i went about creating some themes to make it look better than the defaults that came with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here they are. most of them are generic - but a couple are nice.&lt;/p&gt;

I hate the damned housework. I have three projects I need to finish. my phone photolog, adopt a cholo, and my secret host project.</description>

      <description>here is my new cell phone specs. here is the start to the mms photolog program. it is a bit complicated. stupid blogs ;) I will be putting all the pictures I take here. I love cell phones.. they are my friends and companions forever. someday I will have fancy cell phone/wifi robot friends who will be rightful property owners.  on saturday my parents left. I was sad. but I get to go and see them soon.</description>

      <description>It is a lot of fun. I got a Sony Ericsson T610 from tmobile. as you probably know I was way into sprint phones for awhile. and I recently used the new number portability rule to switch from sprint to tmobile. it was relatively painless - but I spent to much on the phone. btw. bluetooth RULES. I have it so I always sync my phone when I walk into my room.</description>

      <description>So I slept all day yesterday and came to work at 6:00pm and now it is 7:15am and I am confused about what dday was yesterday and what day was two days ago. it seems like a billion years have passed since I was last home.. I guess sleeping under your desk will do that to you. we are apparently finally live. which is nice. I am apparently finally sleepy. need to go home.</description>

      <description>This morning was awesome. I really feel that getting up leisurely at 10:30 is a healthy way to live. last night I attempted to stay up late to help with work stuff. but I onlly made it to about 3:30ish.. I was bummed out. I had planned to stay up late. but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to take my much needed afternoon nap. I suppose I could have used this opportunity to start doing cocaine ;) hahah.</description>

      <description>i just watched an awesome movie called they live. it rules. ruled something fierce. I laughed very hard for most of the movie. it had great lines, terrible acting and ended with a sex scene. it wasn&amp;rsquo;t believable and the action was horrible. in terms of a horrible but awesome movie. this was number one. i have about given up on the tivo. it is SOOOOOOO hard. I hate it. hate it a lot.</description>

      <description>This weekend was insane. as you may be able to tell from the crazy blog entries. I was a madperson. So.. on saturday I went to quad cities juggle fest. it was a lot of fun. I hung out with mark and some nice jugglers from carleton college. we juggled a bunch. I love juggling with little kids - who are as good as I am. hah. at five or so I went to the theatre with mark.</description>

      <description>so I was woken up to do more work.. and I am really annoyed - because the sysadmins decided to chaneg the password and not tell us. which means everything stops until they are awaken and tell me. however.. they turn off their phones and are not coming in until later. so I have no way of doing my job. this is annoying. stupid phones. why isn&amp;rsquo;t the ringer embedded in to peoples temples.</description>

      <description>So I am in colorado.. hanging out with my parents and my brother. it is a lot of fun. I saw my cousins football game today. he did a good job. it is really funny watching little kids play sports. they do really funny things. COle is the quarterback.. so he got to play a lot.. and he is quite good. then we had a nice dinner.. and then I went to fort collins to see where dylan lives, works and hangs out.</description>

      <description>so I really don&amp;rsquo;t believe in god or jesus or the like.. but this is awesome. So apparently mel gibson has lost his mind and is making a movie about the &amp;ldquo;real story&amp;rdquo; of christ. and while they were filming.. the guy playing christ was struck by lightning. hahahahahahahahaha.. seriously.. and the assistent director was hit as well. for the second time since they started shooting.. &amp;ldquo;a producer described how he saw lightning come out of the actor&amp;rsquo;s ear.</description>

      <description>So I get bored every once and awhile and I want to &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; stuff. so lately I have been into hacking the ps2 and the tivo. I just ordered a tivo to hack and I just got my &amp;ldquo;key&amp;rdquo; to the ps2 world. so yesterday I burnt a couple disks to test out my set up. and wham it worked. I was able to boot the ps2linux rescue disk. however, the HD is not formatted so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to boot BBnav.</description>

      <description>So I have been using itunes for around 24 hours now. I have come to the conclusion that we in the PC world are lucky. We have a plethora of software made by a very diverse set of vendors - all of who struggle.. so each product ends up having its own variation on the solution.. they each have unique features.. and eventually one or two products win. The PC software world seems to be based a bit more on the evolution of the solution.</description>

I think sports prepare us for war and conflict. whatever beowulf&amp;hellip;we have got to elect someone better for president in 2004. so I have been getting up far earlier than before.</description>

      <description>The other day a friend lent me one of the CKY videos. I watched it.. and laughed.. and whatever.. so I thought today that I should do a little searching about cky and all related info. so I came accross bam&amp;rsquo;s page. I was browsing it.. and came accross the interview page. it is funny.. but the real interesting part is his fashion tip: rock tight black gear but spray paint it mist of white so it looks dirty.</description>

      <description>stupid media so gorbachev has called Bush&amp;rsquo;s decision to invade Iraq a mistake. wow, that is a surprise. I wonder why it matters when gorbachev says it.. but doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter when the citizens of the US say it. one thing that really pisses me off is that bush is all hot and bothered about national health care for IRAQ and the US is in them midst of a health care crisis and bush is rejecting any possible solution.</description>

I said would not that #ryan1918 was apparently not involved in the person who packeted my box. so here it is.. :  [14:17] (xygoat) but I will note it.  [14:17] (ryan19188) at least say, #ryan1918 had nothing to do with the packeting or something.

I mean - what is better than living in fear with 75 close friends. You don&amp;rsquo;thave to worry about silly things like possessions or whatnot. just fear. it will rule. 
Colin Farrell Rules. Seriously. but not as much as this. I need to get back into legos.</description>

      <description>George Bush is an awesome president. America has lost 3.3 million jobs since Bush took office. In August, more than 93,000 jobs disappeared. 41 million Americans have no health insurance. (4 out of 5 of them are in working families.) This is the 29th month of the Bush recession. Right now, there are more than 9 million Americans who are looking for work. Bush has the worst jobs record of any president since Herbert Hoover during the Great Depression.</description>

      <description>is such a hippie that he is concerned about that &amp;ldquo;fad&amp;rdquo; called global warming. apparently some big chuck of ice broke and now everyone is all scared. it is supposed to be some proof that global warming is real. But nobody knows for sure. I guess we need proof. It is a good thing our government is looking out for us.. oh and I love bush. I will just mark global warming as one of the many many things that scares the hell out of me.</description>

      <description>today I coked myself up on cold medicine and pain killers and made it to work on time.. did work fine.. maybe a little less conscious.. but for the most part fine. and as soon as I got home I crashed like a drunk driver. I guess that makes since. but now at 1 in the morning I am wired off my head and listening to classic rock. all I want to do is sleep.</description>

      <description>The blue line is madness. in the past couple days crazy stuff has gone down. most of it is just crazies interacting with the normals. hehe. today this guy was ranting and raving and another guy tried to settle him down. so the reacted very negatively to that.. and told everyone on the train that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;interact with homosexuals&amp;rdquo; and that he &amp;ldquo;has a spaceship and raygun from god.&amp;rdquo; He also claimed that he was a pro baseball player for the detroit tigers and that mariah carey was his second baseman.</description>

      <description>that the saddest song in the world is Samuel Barber&amp;rsquo;s Adagio for strings. It is used in &amp;lsquo;Amelie&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;platoon&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;elephant man&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Lorenzo&amp;rsquo;s Oil.&amp;rsquo; So sad it is. apparently it was also used as funeral music (Princess Grace, JFK, and Franklin D Roosevelt). William Orbit did a good arrangement of it for his &amp;ldquo;Adagio for Strings&amp;rdquo; album. So last night I went to felix&amp;rsquo;s bday party at vision. I hate vision.</description>

      <description>i guess I still need to write that paper on online communities and the socialization of online relationships. Especially in light of friendster and the development of virtual &amp;ldquo;ubermensch.&amp;rdquo; heh. I guess I wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear in what I was saying. I am naive enough to jump to the conclusion that I can use the idea of the ubermensch when talking about online communities.. when discussing the idea of ubermensch or overmen.</description>

      <description>it isn&amp;rsquo;t hard per se. it is just rough. it is called Into That Darkness. it is about the Franz Stangl the commandant of treblinka. When I first started reading the book - I thought &amp;ldquo;oh.. I can handle this.. it won&amp;rsquo;t be rought.. I have read about this stuff before.&amp;rdquo; little did I know.. i think what is hard for me to understand is how workers at the extermination camps seemed to rationalize the killing.</description>

Dark like a wolf.Laser pointer stats: Standard Red laser pointer: 650nm wavelength; My Green laser pointer: 532 nm wavelength;  9000 ft is 1.</description>

      <description>here are some pics I took with my cameraphone and my laser. the first one is me in my bedroom the laser is being scanned across my chest. the second is a swirl being projected on my book shelf. the third is what happens when you shine a 5mW laser into a really poor digicam. the fourth is the laser being swirled on my servers.. the green laser is incredible at night.</description>

      <description>so I got my green laser in the mail. it is seriously bad ass. like seriously. hah. it is so powerful. I can not describe how powerful it is. it is soooo bright. even in daylight it has incredible visibility. I can shine it about a block away before I lose it. I am confident it is still visible to those near it&amp;hellip;. but that I can&amp;rsquo;t see it.. anyway..it is almost night and I am so excited to see the visible beam.</description>

      <description>so yesterday I read two books. it was madness. I just needed that stimulation I guess..
first I read Angels &amp;amp; Demons by Dan Brown. It was pretty good. a very nice read. I felt that it was similar to those science/medical fiction books that are use a hihg base level of knowledge about the subject&amp;hellip; the jargon I guess.. however Brown&amp;rsquo;s book is about catholicism, the vatican and such.. which makes it really fun to read - since I studied all of that crap in college.</description>

      <description>Oh yes.. I rule. Sometimes I even wonder where my money goes.. anyway.. my new plan is to mount everything I purchased on ebay on to my car and drive to maine. to point out puffins with my fancy space telescope.  ok so today. rather than doing what I was supposed to be doing I read a book by dan brown called angels and demons. it ruled. ok. now time for work.</description>

      <description>as per usual.. a bunch of stuff is happening&amp;hellip;North Korea has given a date to the U.S. to resolve its problems with N. Koreas nuclear arms.. woah.. I guess we should really learn about earth before the N. koreans and the U.S. blow it up.. the weapons inspector from the U.K. that killed himself.. is shown in a tape criticising blair&amp;rsquo;s need for evidence to support his false claim of WMD in Iraq.</description>

      <description>woah. now george bush is bargaining with terrorists after telling the world that the U.S. will not bargain with terrorists EVER. I love how the U.S. treated North Korea completely different than Iraq. North Korea was telling everyone who would listen that they have nuclear weapons.. the U.S. basically told North Korea to shut up.. whereas when Iraq said they didn&amp;rsquo;t have WMD, the U.S. attacked, wtf&amp;hellip;  Birds are insane.</description>

I was listening to them.. well really sleeping to them.. and my dreams were infused with chaos. I had three very violent war dreams in quick succession. All three took place in my grandfathers hometown. The first was about being invaded and put into a camp.</description>

      <description>So today I got up.. got right to work. did a little bit of financial planning.. played with bank statements and suddenly noticed a very large charge from sprintpcs. so I called them and they suck. really. they suck so so much. they alleged that I received two phones, started a new service contract and then canceled. thus invoking about $600 of charges. So I talked to them and they have a different &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; on what happened and refuse to refund 400 of the 600.</description>

      <description>So there is this new movie out called whole which is about Body Integrity Identity Disorder - or the want to become a amputee. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it - however it will probably be interesting. we have seen this stuff before, but not to such an extent as outlined in the movie or in this article. I think that this stuff is insane. I did like how lalala talked about the socialization of a psycological condition.</description>

      <description>So on thursday I got really bored and made a false profile for a christian dating service. It is really lame.. however we made a funny profile. unfortunantly it deleted the best part. I was so sad. :( here is an excerpt:  When I was a younger lad, I unfortunately witnessed a crime of passion that changed my life forever. Finding my mother in bed with our gardener caused me to reject the life of sin that had been a part of my life up until that point.</description>

      <description>so lasts nights performance was lame. I mean it was OK from a juggling perspective. we barely dropped and we &amp;ldquo;looked&amp;rdquo; good.. hehe. (pictures to come)- but the show was dumb. I wish we had a real band to juggle with. heh.  This site is really great. I really enjoyed the pictures. so I made a script that picks a random one and displays it. the script is here. just keep reloading.</description>

      <description>after work I went to the apple store opening. it was interesting. nothing like sitting outside in a line for 2 hours with a bunch of people who are waiting to get into a computer store. I took three rather poor pictures: 1-2-3. stupid lack of camera. I need to remember to grab my digicam before events like this. it isn&amp;rsquo;t like it is a cumbersome thing to carry around&amp;hellip; I was able to arrive in time to get a shirt&amp;hellip; however it was a large t-shirt.</description>

I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much done. today however is a different story.. after getting off rather slowly I finally got on track and worked a bunch. I got a lot of the first part of my project done. it is still far from being completed - but.. it is right on track.. eek.. still it is a big project.</description>

However - it was rather well executed and overall it did a good job as a party. my friend Chris DJ&amp;rsquo;d and that ruled.. but some cats were pissed.. cuz his headphones were similiar to their previously stolen ones. wtf. speaking of headphones. - I got my new ones.</description>

      <description>remember to watch out. Bush is about to make a nomination to the supreme. The proposed &amp;ldquo;man&amp;rdquo; is William Pryor, a young attorney general from alabama who has some alarming views; most alarming is his stance on minority voting rights, disabled person rights, reproductive rights, and prisonors rights. he is cool enough to want the ten commandments posted at every courthouse. His reasoning for becoming a lawyer was to fight the ACLU.</description>

WHen I was a smaller person.. I used to have matiss sign my credit cards. he often would draw little pictures. it was humorous. this is an interesting article about afrodisiacs.</description>

I went after work to visit marcia at the art institute, we then went to Joy Yee on a whim and had food and great fruit shakes. I love when hanging out is good. like.. not silly or pretentious.. just chill.. after that I went to busy beaver and got the virgin tears and unemployable buttons and then went and to the pelican/melt banana show.</description>

      <description>so .. the last 2 weeks I haven&amp;rsquo;t really hung out or gone out as much as I had before. it is weird when you go out an insane amount and then suddenly stop. I like it.. the stopping.. it was so relaxing and so nice. I hung out with my mom and aunt/cousin.. and hung out with marcia a bunch.. and now I am needing to re-introduce myself into the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; world.</description>

Please don&amp;rsquo;t send me links like that, those kind of images flash through my head when I fucking people and it makes me want to die.</description>

      <description>Check out this site and then buy a bunch of music there. It rules. Today was out of control. I worked a lot.. but I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I got much done. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. it is so weird. I am all hopped up. tomorrow my mother, aunt and cousin come to visit. it will be fun. I am a bit worried about entertaining a younger person. I only know bars.</description>

      <description>First off.. they wrote a good piece of software. They wrote the original gnutella client and leaked enough info out for it to be easily reverse engineered and propagated. but AOL pulled it. they recently released a program called waste that was removed from the website by AOL. Since it was removed, nobody is able to download it. I really enjoy watching justin frankel totally fuck with AOL. What really gets me is this rather humorous post on DADD (Dating Attention Deficit Disorder).</description>

      <description>so this weekend ruled. my friend marica took me to tango heh. yep. that is correct. I had forgotten how much I enjoy to dance ballroom style. it is a lot of fun. so on saturday I slept a bit, did laundry and watched a movie called gia. It was quite sad. We watched it mid day.. so then going out and hanging with a bunch of rocker kids was quite weird - it seems that often their goal is to have the life that gia led.</description>

      <description>Last night I was possibly supposed to hang out with this friend/aquaintence. it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen so I went to lula and ate dinner with my laptop. I was able to get a bunch of work done, eat a really incredible meal(salmon with rubarb and parschnips.. heh.) and get desert and all that. Since I was all by myself at the resturant I was sitting up at the front bar area, so when another person came by themselves they sat with me.</description>

I have to do allll of this stuff that generally would be quite annoying.. hoever it is leading to a &amp;ldquo;better time&amp;rdquo; and will make work a lot more bareable - so I guess that is &amp;lsquo;ok.&amp;rsquo; Umm yea. I am eating an artichoke, chicken, mushroom rap.. listening to horrible trance and being bombarded with hotornot entries from all directions. what fun. i am really excited to get my new ipod.</description>

      <description>The indy 500 rules. it is so totally insane. Last night we rolled in about 10 oclock and arrived amidst a bout of drunken insanity. This man called lurch was doing insane things. not normal things. it was crazy. so we drank a bunch and eventually made it to bed. My brother has a dv cam so we just filled a bunch of crazy stuff. They brought two scooters, and a golf cart.</description>

      <description>Today I had another battle: me vs. pseudo-ephedrine and caffiene. I lost the battle, however I won the war. I finally got some nyquil so maybe I will actually sleep. I keep having waves of absolute exhaustion wash over me. woah. it is insane. But I am propping myself up against my cube with the sticks I collected at lunch and attempting to seem busy.speaking of busy - I seriously rocked a meeting this morning/early afternoon.</description>

      <description>after my brief bout with insanity due to over the counter drug use.. I decided to grow up. I know have a lawyer and I am reading information about purchasing a place to live. woah. that is insane. all of my coworkers are doing this too. I think it is madness. I mean. I recently bulked at the paltry sum of $4500 for some servers.. let alone $200K for a condo in chitown.</description>

It allows any blog owner to make a .klip file for someone to download, so that they can syndicate their content easy and whatnot. I was tired of only having the canned content that serence provides. now I can use whatever I want.. hehe. I rule. Check out the Automagic .</description>

It was great. He was a really nice guy. so so funny. The rest of our guests arrived so we got a table and sat down.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t understand it. spring is here. well sorta. it isn&amp;rsquo;t really in chicago. but it is &amp;ldquo;here.</description>

      <description>So I sit her at almost three in the morning with one show off and one shoe on. I have not been home since eight this morning and I have just arrived. I realize that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense.. but whatever. Anyway.. today was weird - I had two rather pivotal meeting at work and about other work.. as well as really got some good stuff done at work.. I then left work to go to the ministry show which started at an ungodly six o clock and on the way I saw the aftermath of some horrible wreck or engagment.</description>

      <description>This game rules. It is the tron cars. So so fun. what a great lunchtime game ;). I should probably get that movie t some time. so I got a new plugin for winamp that tracks what you listen to and then analyzes it and creates a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; playlist for you that fits your music taste. however, it has to be trained. and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to train it. so I am training it by listening to music.</description>

Among the photos were those of Jenna and Barbara Bush, the president?s twin 21-year-old daughters, Ballanco said, adding that soldiers took them down &amp;ldquo;to protect the president.</description>

I would be said. especially if we were juggling and I caught a knife with my eye or something. we would probably have to stop the performance. I am sad.. iron maiden is touring in europe. I only hope that they swing by chicago.. :( hopefully.. my dream would come true.. finally. In other news.</description>

I really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say another.. it isn&amp;rsquo;t like they are repeating.. the last one was two years ago or so. but they are insane and kinda fun. this one started out with me being in a symphonic band practice. I was playing bari-sax.. I was not good - so the band director yelled at me. I was sad. but for some reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the music we were attempting to sight-read.</description>

I think I even heard nelly.. which is funny. I ended up getting a bit drunk do to the long island ice tea that was purchased for me. The best part about the night was the company.. some of my good new friends and some good old friends were all there.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my attempt at putting all of the knowledge i used in the creation of the first to market website 3gScreensaver.com and A500hacking.com into a project that everyone can enjoy and benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is basically a php script that you can drop into ANY directory and have any of the appropriate content served to your phone. Any php hosting site with access to the mail function can do this.  The best part is that you do not have to modify any setting with your web server. This script handles all content types.. no tricky apache config modifications or IIS nonsense..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://harper.blog/demon/&#34;&gt;original page&lt;/a&gt; is still here!&lt;/p&gt;

Last night I hung out with a bunch of cool cats and we went to iggy&amp;rsquo;s and ate dinner. we got there about 11:50 so it was a good time. I drank beer and coke - not together.. mind you.. I am not like some of my friends.. hehe.. ;). it was fun. they sang happy birthday to me.. and succeeded in embarrasing me slightly.</description>

      <description>heh. so I stayed up real late tonight looking at web cam girl pages. what a weird world that is. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand it. Such a voyeuristic world we have here. poor weird cat. Sometimes the internet is not amusing. It took me far too long to realize that site was ran by racists.. for a real blow to rationality check out the whitepower kids site or maybe the whitepower womens site.</description>

      <description>The situation with that girl that was abducted in salt lake city is poised to become very very strange. I mean she was gone for quite a long time. anything can happen in that ime - including befriending ones abductors.. thus patty hearst.. I guess it is probably psychological. but it still makes for a insane story. I think that the US should look at mormans as insane after this. The young girl was married to her abductor in a crazy billigimist marriage.</description>

      <description>I have needed to update this site for so long. I guess really since last thursday. So last thursday I went out with some friends.. maybe a little too late.. it was all my poor little body could handle. I was horribly sick the next day and had to stay home from work.. which sucks.. cuz work is cool right now.. but whatever. so I slept most of the day - but was supposed to drive to Champaign/urbana for a juggling fest around 11 at night.</description>

      <description>So for the past week or so I kept seeing this guy in newspapers, on websites and on tv and I thought ron jeremy had gotten arrested. I guess I never actually paid attention.. when I finally did.. boy was I disappointed.I recently got the new cursive album. It has a couple allusions to pinocchio. weird. eh. that flash thing is cool though. Anyway.. the new cursive album is quite good.</description>

      <description>I for some reason had an aversion to updating my website this week. I think it was cuz I was so busy at work. serious. I was crazy busy. and it was frustrating things I was doing. for some reason - everything I tried to do didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I was annoyed. and most of the stuff was just stupid. heh. like I had done it one hundred times before and none of it worked this time.</description>

Ever since I saw red dawn when I was little - I have been scared of world war. and now we get our chance. I hope we don&amp;rsquo;t screw this up. I am not really crazy. I just think that our world is inane rigth now and needs some humor in it.</description>

      <description>I just finished watching Donnie Darko. It was quite the movie. I enjoyed it. I thought it was humorous that on halloween - they were showing the last temptation of christ - a movie that isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily halloweenish. It is also funny how similar donnie darko was to this movie. Heh. I smiledwhen they showed clips of evil dead. I really enjoyed the movie. I liked the music and how the sound interacted with the plot.</description>

      <description>so a club broke and many people died last night. My parents called at 7:30 to make sure I was alive. 7:30. that is so early. anyway.. I can totally imagine that happening in many of the clubs I have been in. they all have ONE entrance or exit and it is usually very small and around a lot of stairs. Friday I went to REDNO5 and their was a slight scuffle on the landing of one of the staircases and some people fell&amp;hellip; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine what would happen if everyone wanted to leave.</description>

      <description>Happy Valentines dayToday is my brothers birthday. Happy birthday dylan. for your birthday I got you a nuclear war threat. sweet huhI love the our leaders ability to really fudge certain things.. like the propaganda that they are spewing. it would be better if the propaganda didn&amp;rsquo;t fall apart within fifteen minutes of them presenting it. good propaganda and spin needs to last for the duration of the conflict. how are the america people let alone the U.</description>

      <description>So washington is prepared. I would be so surprised if we were to receive a air strike. could you imagine what would happen. beside the fear and trauma that would occur. I mean every aspect of our life would be affected. It would be insane. I am not ready fo that. I am ready for this however. wow. that could really change the dynamics of our foreign policy. maybe bush&amp;rsquo;s missile shield should be a priority.</description>

I have a theory. it is this: so bush declared terror level orange and now their are security dogs on the blue line at all times. I think the two are related.</description>

I have been skirting the law for awhile now and I can no longer do it(btw I am insured.. just not registered.. ugh). heh. last night matiss and I invited some cats to come over and watch the spooky michael jackson interview. boy that d00d is a weirdo.</description>

      <description>man. I had a rough weekend. I am so so tired. t I r e d . . this entry will be composed of me complaining.. just letting you know ;). I have been sick since tuesday. and I can&amp;rsquo;t get better. for some reason - it sucks. I think I lead a unhealthy lifestyle.. mostly in terms of eating. but smoking crack so much certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t help. So yesterday miriam left for cologne.</description>

      <description>Well. I go home today. I am excited. I love sleeping in my own bed. so nice. and it will be the first time in awhile. Last night I exported my IPOD music db to a comma delimited file and imported it into endeca(the search engine I am at training for). This was a fun exercise - it showed me a bunch of neat things&amp;hellip; like how much music I have ;) You can really get a nifty view of your data when you look at it with good tools.</description>

      <description>I am mad at boston. mostly cuz it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a damn bit of sense. the roads all go this way and that. I was not aware of how drasticly logic chicago&amp;rsquo;s roadway system was until about 45 minutes ago. also wtf is with the trains that make NO sense. serious. No sense at all. and they are really buses.. acting like trains. not trains at all. slackers&amp;hellip;bush is kinda dumbi have no doubt that this &amp;ldquo;state of the union&amp;rdquo; nonesense will only get us into trouble.</description>

I think many peopla agree&amp;hellip; but the evidence is convincing &amp;hellip; but is it real.. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that matters honestly.. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know anyone who wants to go to war with saddam. and the aggressive nature of the U.</description>

I wish I had saved that. what genius.. anyway.. at the Middle East Web Log there is a nifty article about how saddam is hiding both the smoke and the guns. I thought that bushes statement that &amp;ldquo;since we didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything - that means they are hiding the weapons&amp;rdquo; - ruled.</description>

      <description>My friend Jon got an article written about him in our hometown newspaper. Check it out. He walked a long way. Wierd - there is apparently a small amount of opposition to the government having a &amp;ldquo;super database&amp;rdquo; of information against us citizens. And in a shocking move the US decides that N. Korea is not a threat after all&amp;hellip; wtf.. heh. luckly we are registering people who are suspected terrorists.</description>

      <description>So last night my brother graduated college. It was probably the most entertaining graduation ceremony I have seen in a long long time. One of the speakers kept swearing and cussing.. hehe. and everyone kept gasping at what he was saying. but he kept it up - it was so funny. I laughed a bunch. Only 20 or so people graduated. so it was a very small group. After the ceremony we went to dinner at this nice sea food resturant.</description>

      <description>Today I didn&amp;rsquo;t goto work. I was sick and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I could make it through a whole day of work. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been eating all that well.. and it was reflected by my bodies giving up and telling me to fuck off .. heh .. yea that is pretty much how it went ;) so I slept until 5:30&amp;hellip; which was weird - cuzi planned on coming in to work after 1:00 - but whatever.</description>

I really don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do about my old receiver.. but whatever - we watched the new Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the ring with all the extra footage and such. whee.. I like that movie.. I have watched it far too many times.. It was a nice gathering though.</description>

      <description>I thought os a addition to this weblog awhile ago.. but it has left me. I am writing it anyway.. without a clue as to where it will lead me. I think it may be about my rockstar friend jamie - or maybe about existing in this weird world of fashion - without an idea of fashion.. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know. I have been reading a bunch of phillip k dick books.</description>

      <description>This is from a couple days ago but whatever:  A report was released by a bunch of British physicians that said that &amp;ldquo;A war against Iraq could kill half a million people, warns a new report by medical experts - and most would be civilians.&amp;rdquo;. Looks like we don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about anything. Oh yea - A secretive federal court on Monday granted police broad authority to monitor Internet use, record keystrokes and employ other surveillance methods against terror and espionage suspects.</description>

      <description>one of three choices:  Fiery death from a high rise building War! Nuclear War Bush&amp;rsquo;s Missile Crisis Corporate office job  So many choices. I will choose Office job. Thank you. Apparently Gore doesn&amp;rsquo;t much like Bush&amp;rsquo;s economic strategy. I don&amp;rsquo;t much like Bush&amp;rsquo;s call for a Domestic spy agency. I get scared enough when they start appropriating private militia for government use, let alone when my tax dollars pay for me to get arrested for haveing a liberal anti-war website - eep.</description>

Hi,  I&amp;rsquo;m a friend of Harper&amp;rsquo;s, and he was telling me about your diving job. We began to wonder a couple of things about diving.  For instance, if you had to fight a monkey underwater, assuming that the monkey was a well trained diver (he&amp;rsquo;s a natural in the water and very athletic), and the monkey was equipped with a knife and the necessary skills to use it, who would win this battle?</description>

I had a lot of weird dreams about moving from my cubicle to a strange undisclosed location and losing my headphones.. or something it was confusing. Last night I emailed myself regarding a weblog post I was supposed to make. here it is: My friend jon spent some time on the PCT and also spent some time hanging out with these lovely ladies.</description>

      <description>My friend Davidson Cole has made a movie called Design. It is about:  Eighteen-year-old Sonya is struggling to save her father from alcoholism after his wife leaves him. Voyeuristic photographer Nicholas is obsessed with women, yet hides behind the prying lens of his camera. Cursed factory worker Seamus and his fiance, Kate, are planning their wedding and coming to grips with the truth about each other&amp;ndash;and themselves. The three stories intersect in one evening full of predestined encounters and bizarre circumstances.</description>

      <description>Apparently a protest is going down against the Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD). The TABD offers an effective framework for enhanced cooperation between the transatlantic business community and the governments of the European Union (EU) and United States (US). Or the TABD is a coalition of U.S. and European CEOs, that is mandated by and gets unlimited access to the U.S. and European governments. It helps boost transatlantic trade for large corporations by promoting the WTO and knocking down &amp;ldquo;barriers to trade&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Community &amp;amp; Digital Rights In the beginning of October I was faced with an interesting situation. I wanted to create a website that allowed for people to upload there own media, but not infringe on copyrights and licenses that I don&amp;rsquo;t currently own or are not interested in obtaining.
I tried to find a good way to solve this problem, and I figured a community controlled digital rights management system was good.</description>

      <description>I have always thought that a military action in Iraq without the support of the UN could result in igniting a much larger and more violent conflict. The fact that the middle east is a powder keg waiting to explode and the fact that numerous other geopolitical situations are walking a very thin line leads me to conclude now is not the time for an international conflict - especially one where the only support we have is from Great Britian.</description>

      <description>I juggled at six flags again this weekend. My hands turn so so black it is unnatural. they just change to a different shade altogether.. no matter how much you wash them. so troublesome. Anyway.. yesterday I worked a bunch and played with my mind not understanding time changes.. so funny. I am still pretty bummed about wellstone. That was a true loss (versus all those other people who died :P).</description>

      <description>I was listening to smoe john zorn minding my own business when outta no where Silent Lucidity by Queensryche comes on. this was a song that was played at a friend of mines funeral in high school. He died of alcohol posioning.. in some nieghbors lawn. It was really fuxored up. However, the song was incredible sad and appropriate.. and it spawned a nice conversation with a friend about artists and songs that can spark so much emotion it is often hard to understand.</description>

      <description>It is interesting that when UN is trying to push weapons inspections and congress is giving all of our money to defense that the dow drops. I think that bush should hurry upwith this war. Do you think that anyone will stop bush?
 India is starting to withdraw from pakistani borders. COuld this be the desentegration of the powderkeg like climate the world is exhibiting? I doubt it :(whatever.. most of this is drivel.</description>

      <description>my brother came over this weekend from LA. It was great. We hung out a bunch and generally chilled out. It was nice to hang out when we are older..
 One of the most interesting things about this weekend was the strange occurance of people asking us which one of us is older. I guess it is because we are now similarly sized and full grown.. or there about. it was interesting.</description>

      <description>I started out simply enough with the a500hacking.com website, but i soon noticed that the audience for that site had grown, and was hammering my server. I was also getting quite a few donations and noticed that a lot of people seemed interested in giving me more of their hard earned money. So i created this page. It basically allows for anyone to create a &amp;ldquo;locker&amp;rdquo; to hold all of their personal pictures that they want to be able to put on their phone.</description>

I would link back to the article from over a year ago about how I love built to spill and I really enjoy them in concert. But since it isn&amp;rsquo;t today I won&amp;rsquo;t link to that specific article.. instead I will tell you. I really like built to spill and I really enjoy them in concert.</description>

      <description>Bush is now being compared to hitler by his peers. Whoa. In a surprise move, the UN has upset Bush&amp;rsquo;s plans for WAR. I guess they really didn&amp;rsquo;t like his plan all that well. Maybe it was because Iraq has no weapons of mass destrution. &amp;ndash; In other news, there is absolutely no racial profiling by the air marshals. and the &amp;ldquo;terrorists&amp;rdquo; from the south apparently did pay their toll. wtf!</description>

      <description>Tonight I went to see afriends fashion show. It was interesting. Quite something really. the first two collections were good. The models were very professional and the whole presentation was well thought out. The third collection was from the crisiswear, and I have seen it many times before.. it is ok.. not bad. .but not super appealing for me.. however.. my friend rachel was modeling for him so that was nice to see.</description>

      <description>I have a cynical view on terrorism. I feel that a lot of what we hear and see form the media.. could be government propaganda. I mean it also could be real. you really never know. Today is a good example. Sen. Patrick Leahy is investigating whether west nile virus is part of a terrorist plot. This could be a good chance for the government to just be like &amp;ldquo;yea it is&amp;hellip; and we need more money.</description>

      <description>Check out me.. build one for yourself&amp;hellip; I found some chicago based design kids. It is neat to see the internet that I know and love suddenly appear in a physical form around me&amp;hellip; For design-geek events check out Anonymous Federated. It seems to be cool.. but has no events posted at this moment. Here is a good indie rock music review site&amp;hellip; that is ran by this guy maybe.. I guess the test is whether it will hold up to pitch fork.</description>

      <description>So one year ago about now I was arriving at work and noticed how everyone was leaving. a friend had woke me up early to tell me about the first plane.. and then the second. it was weird.. I learned about most of this on AIM. So I then went to work. Like I said.. all I remember was all the people streaming out of buildings. I came to my office sat there.</description>

      <description>Apparently it has become insane outside. nasa is planning on reading people minds.. what.. wtf.. what.. no sense..  A senetor is questioning the lack of enron indictments..  no.. I hope bush doesn&amp;rsquo;t get mad an shoot him .. in texas style..  iraq and russia signed or are goign to sign a deal.. I wonder if this will lead to WW3.. hopefully.. weeeeeeeeeeeeee but if WW3 starts.. I am sure the plans would be leaked to the press so that we woudl all know what is going on.</description>

      <description>something is strangely off about today. maybe it is the cloud cover.. maybe the temp. maybe the wind.. maybe the lack of reality within my already pallid life.. maybe the drama I make up in sentences like the last one. ;).. but no matter what it is.. it looks like bush and his iraq issue is coming to a head. apparently a outspoken and often-ally of bush is making statements about how an attack on iraq would lead to apocalypse.</description>

      <description>The good news is.. I came a accros this really great dj, dj Z-trip. I guess he is doing work for ugh.. linkin park.. but other than that minor character flaw.. he does great remixes.. specifically a cd called &amp;ldquo;uneasy listening.&amp;rdquo; It is a bunch of remixes of pretty good songs.. like metallica and midnight oil mixed together.. wtf.. yep .. its weird..
The bad news is that the US is really dumb.</description>

Sharks are like aliens.. hehe but we get to see them. and hang out with them. they look so foreign. so mean. so evil. and so so cool.  speaking of aliens. we are going to see signs soon.</description>

I also wonder if more people are starting to realize how screwed up bush is getting. I certainly hope that the general population notices that he is a crook and lets our lovely leaders notice.</description>

      <description>i guess conagra, the company behind the beef industry in my home town, recently recalled 18.6 million pounds of ground beef. wtf. it is insanity. I hope no one dies. An interesting article about the beef industry is here. It mentions greeley a couple times - especially in regard to the number of cows it slaughters per hour and how the increase in numbe rof cows.. has increased the likelyhood for beef contamination.</description>

Lately I have been trying to figure out if the idea that &amp;ldquo;it all works out in the end&amp;rdquo; is a fate based idea. I think that it is. I do not think however that nuclear war is a fate that any wants. but whatever&amp;hellip; stupid religion.</description>

      <description>bush and cheney get to have a good time justifiing their actions soon. It looks as though cheney knew about some of the sketchy business practices that he questioned. It also is strange that the person that bush picked to be the head of corporate task force was was previously the head of a credit-card company that paid more than $400 million to settle allegations of unfair and deceptive business practices.</description>

Not too late. but late enough to feel like a rebel.. and I went to work. I was able to wear jeans.. cuz friday is casual.. hah. so I worked.. and then I got home&amp;hellip; and went to a couple art openings.. The one that was memorable was A curatorial collaboration using the work of Jimmy McBride(heh).</description>

      <description>i love the internet. Awhile back I posted 60X1.com, I finally took the time to finish it and much to my chagrin it led me to some amazing sites: tinkin - this is the guy who made 60X1.com he has a bunch of really great anti war stuff. it is so good. it makes me happy I want to give this site to everyone as a gift. I think that politics is often forgotten when it comes to internet art.</description>

I really do feel that industrial music will spawn from this.</description>

      <description>for news goto: Rense.com - kinda sketchy but interesting and fun filled. also a tad bit anti-israel/semitic(kind sketchy). Drudge Report - a very simple and effective website. Sometimes it is nonsense.. or stupid poli-fashion shit. but its usually worth the visit. RATM current event page - this is a pretty good collection of links, that is seemingly updated daily. It is sanctioned by RATM which is funny. Indymedia - a democratic media outlet.</description>

      <description>I laughed when I heard that the U.S. &amp;ldquo;finally&amp;rdquo; bombed a civilian target. I did not laugh because I find the killing of civilians to be funny, I laughed because of the ridiculousness of the entire situation. Of course we were bombing civilian targets. Of course we have killed thousands of afghans. this is, in my opinion, part of the war against terrorism that our illustrious president has so eloquently fought.</description>

      <description>I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. the U.S. has proven what a dumb ass country we are:&amp;ldquo;The Pledge, as currently codified, is an impermissible government endorsement of religion because it sends a message to unbelievers that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.</description>

      <description>heh. I am a dork. so matiss and I went to the KMFDM concert like 1 hour early so we could get good seats. We showed up adn there was a block long line. we pushed and pulled our way through it and got seats right in the center of the stage. We stood and waited through two not very good bands(kidney thieves and 16 volt) and suddenly right before 16 Volt came on - the kids in front of us left.</description>

so I was listening to NPR the last night during dinner.. and they mentioned how some people were critical of the Bush administrations label of Jose Padilla as a combatant. what is interesting, is that it appears that the suspect may not have be all he could have been.</description>

      <description>This is a rant: I do not like that we are at war right now. I think it is really ridiculous. I mean, our enemy is a group of militants that we don?t officially know exists, they use weapons that are more powerful than what we use, they are scare mongered into inhuman monsters. And it seems that bush has yet to acknowledge that there is a problem in the middle east(in terms of U.</description>

      <description>So I have been reading a lot of african literature. it is so nice. I really needed somethign that would make me smile again. all my books had gotten stale. so it was a nice change.. This weekend was strangely lonely. I just sat around. even when I was out.. it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly thrilling. I did get my project done. which was cool.. and received good word from its recepients. but.</description>

      <description>The Toys-R-Us on state is going out of business so my coworkers and myself are going out of business and all the toys are uber cheap. I picked up a HitClips playerand some britney hitclips. I am excited. It is rather shoddy and it did cost more then it should have(especially considering the brief amusement it caused). I am interested in hacking the little guy.. I would be interested in hooking it up to something else.</description>

Last night the phone rang like 5 minutes after I went to sleep.. at like 1:45 or so&amp;hellip; and I when I got up to answer the phone I glanced over and noticed a glowing ball of spirits next to my bed.</description>

This burnt me real bad and made me a littl ebit sad. however, since that moment I have always enjoyed high voltage equipment.

      <description>Some activists have papered the city of chicago. It is great. My boss came into one of our offices and pointed out the thousands and thousands of little papers that said &amp;ldquo;George W. Wants War!&amp;rdquo; Someone obviously dropped them by aeroplane or by building top. This is a great way to get people to notice. I only hope that it is covered by the papers. I hope that the people get arrested and a big stick is caused.</description>

      <description>Tonight my friend and myself went and saw belle and sebastion at the congress. It was incredible. They really rocked the house something fierce. They played a lot of great songs. and they ended with a rendition of Thin Lizzies &amp;ldquo;The Boys Are Back In Town.&amp;rdquo; The concert was so fun. Insanity. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want it to end eva. heh.  I just found out that my site, audreyhacking.com was one of around 16 honorary mentions out of around 460.</description>

      <description>I saw motorhead last night. It was so so loud and my head wanted to die. Morbid angel and Today is the Day also played. Morbid angel is one of those bands that creates a sound that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be coming from humans. It is so rough. The drummer is insane. They all had the requisite metal hair, however they used big fans to blow it past their faces and heads. it looked so cool.</description>

      <description>Last night at juggling club. I got into an argument with a strange suburban man who had good ideas, but was really stuck on how capitalism is evil. I am unable to work in that paradigm. I cannot think that capitalism is the evil. I think the how capitalism is executed can be bad, exploitive and destructive.. but that is not the failt of capiitalism. It is the fault of the executor.</description>

      <description>Tonight was fantastic. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I have used fantastic to describe a night in awhile. I went and got some new clothes, matiss and I went to the Art Institute&amp;rsquo;s graduate art show(It is real real good and huge) and then we hung out with a cool new friend and we went to see spider man. I really enjoyed both.  The movie was quite something. It was incredibly funny and sam raimi has proven himself to be the master of kitsch.</description>

      <description>I have a strange hobby where I look at people peronal home pages. I really enjoy reading peoples blogs and learning all sorts of interesting things about them. heh. it is a strange voyeuristic hobby I guess, however it passes the time. I used to look primarily at slashdot comments. But lately I have been playing on moc, I recently searched for people in my home town of greeley and I found an interesting phenomona: if you search chicago you don&amp;rsquo;t come across many women that are really big into the web cam/subtle porn culture, whereas if you do the same search for greeley 2&amp;frasl;3 of the people are webcam girls.</description>

But the repository also has a lot of personal pictures as well. It just gets my voyeuristic juices a flowin. that along with MOC an weblog reading of course. i normally don&amp;rsquo;t want to post shite like those pics.</description>

      <description>So Microsoft wants to control the national ID initiative with its .NET passport system. They want to issue every citizen a passport and then use the insecure protocol to run the national ID system. I guess what is worse, is that the U.S. is considering useing the technology. damn. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to think. I think that maybe it would be cool. In that sort of wierd shadowrun kind of way.</description>

      <description>Technologists are so crazy. they never seem to stop trying to figure out what is going on. this is a great link exemplifing this very idea. The DSS scene is stuck because of DTV&amp;rsquo;s good ability to counteract good hacks to their smart card system. They keep upgrading and fuxoring everyone up. But the hackers keep coming out with new fixes.. and tey keep making sites that teach kids how to participate.</description>

      <description>this morning whilst I was in the shower, I got to thinking about how anoying our media and its relationship with the government is. In one particular example: the whole enron thing. It seems that when clinton ran into some women problems, he was crucified - however when bush, cheney and the like get involved in a complicated financial scam the media as well as our elected leaders turn their collective eye.</description>

I really don&amp;rsquo;t know. but I do know one thing: when I grow up I really want to be a secret agent. I wonder if they would let me. I tend to lean a certain strange leftist direction. hmm. I also want to goto graduate school. it woudl rule. I also want to get some certifications.</description>

      <description>tonight.. I did and possibly finished my taxes. it is incredible. I thought this day would never come. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t very hard. especailly with lovely turbotax helping me along the way ;). That is very funny to me. All I had to do was answer questionsa nd hope it came out right. I hope that I did it correctly. I hated tonights academy awards. I thought that beautiful mind should not have been awarded all of the awards.</description>

      <description>Besides ineffectual teachers, and boring classes the United states commoner is threatened with a large scale war that may destroy us all. I was walking along the street this weeked and a bike messanger throw what amounted to a handfull of flyers in our direction. they said: &amp;ldquo;G.W. Bush wants war.&amp;rdquo; Which seems to be not very far from the truth.
In the past couple days I have noticed quite the mess of our foriegn policy.</description>

      <description>I love going to the internet and seeing a fresh brew of fear waiting for me on the other side. It is quite disconcerting. Check out this and this. as well as this and this. 
It seems inconceivable to me, that are happy little world is sent back into the cold war. But this time the opposition is much more aggressive and is fighting a moral battle that isn&amp;rsquo;t simply won by having patience and being the &amp;ldquo;better nation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>tonight was great. I got home.. I had been feeling like hell all afternoon. I took a shower. Which for some reason made me feel a lot better.. maybe it was because I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken one in awhile. So anyway. I got home. and then a friend called and invited me for dinner. whoo it was nice. I like it when people save you from an impending doom you can feel.</description>

After I got home from work - I immediately got a huge headache. HUGE. it was horrible. I stumbled around and then a firned picked me up. I passed out in her car and awoke to find myself in a nice indian resturant.</description>

      <description>I remember when a friend of mine used to allude to my relationships as weather. He would ask how the weather was. I would always respond with some equally vague answer. It was fun. Today I went to watch breakdancing. It would have been fun, if it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been canceled. suxors. However. rigth before break dancing I talked to a new friend on the phone for quite awhile. It was nice.</description>

It is kinda cumbersome and not exactly convienient. however. it works. ugh So a friend came over tonight.. she is nice. I would like to get to know her better. heh. however.. all her stuff was stolen out of her car whilst she was visiting.</description>

      <description>I forgot to mention in my last post that I went and saw the show producers. What a funny show it is. Boy howdy. heh. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard anything about it so I was quite surprised. Matthew Broderick was very good as was the understudy for nathan lane(alas he couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it). It was quite funny. some of the jokes caught me quite off guard. heh. being in new york, and seeing a lot of hasidic jews.</description>

The funniest shit happened while I was there: they thanked all the veterns for fighting for freedom so we could &amp;ldquo;sit here and smoke, drink eat and gamble.&amp;rdquo; WTF. that is exactly what they are fighting to maintain. it ruled. I lost 6 dollars.</description>

      <description>Last night I went out to a seedy bar with some friends after work. Drank a little - helped another friend with web problems. and then went to some movies. I say some because we couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to goto the movie we wanted to goto. So we purchased tickets to a cheaper movie and then after an hour of the cheaper movie, we sneaked out and the movie we came to see was just starting.</description>

I didn&amp;rsquo;t flinch at all. Which in retrospect I think is quite wierd. the car just slammed on its brakes and I kept walking and didn&amp;rsquo;t think anything wierd was going on. heh. whatever.Today is such a wierd day.</description>

      <description>Heh. I really want to port cripple smash to the web. I was in contact some years ago with the author about possibly porting it to PHP or java. It is written right now in pascal. I guess I could convert it to delphi and release a windows binary. heh. If you want, you can download the original BBS door, but you will need a bbs to run it from. Good luck.</description>

      <description>I am so tired today. I wish I was a simple web app designer. Soemtimes I don&amp;rsquo;t really like my job. This is the first time I have used this blog to vent about my employment. I feel bad venting. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have anywhere else to go.. ;). I am frustrated at what I see as unprogressive movement. It isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily anything that happened today. it is just that I get frustrated when certain actions and reactions were predicted and nobody notices.</description>

      <description>since I last updated this page. On thursday.. I found out that I would be accompanying a bunch of servers to vienna, virginia in an emergency server upgrade. So I went and rented a car, got servers from one colo facility and brought them to virginia. We drove a bundle of hours.. went through indiana, ohio, pennsylvania, maryland, virginia and Washington DC. We ended up staying right across from the target data center and so the server delivivery was insanly easy.</description>

      <description>So everyday I walk down some street that is being reconstructed. It is really neat to see civil engineering happen over time. Quite something really. I quite enjoy watching the big machinery move about and crush and build and destroy things. I often time mistake them for dinosaurs. I mean I know they are not dinosaurs.. however they could be. I imagine them being the same size as dinosaurs - and in that flintstones sorta way.</description>

Of course, my favorite is the popping and locking, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be as popular among the kids. alas.. it also makes me feel inadequate hanging around with people who are incredible break dancers. heh. it was funny to see.</description>

      <description>So I often have computer dreams. I dream of editing something in VI or Pico. I dream of installing content managment systems. I dream of mostly software. Last night I dreamt of trying to install a motherboard ethernet card into another motherboard&amp;hellip; so I had to unsolder everything out and resolder it in. heh. I don&amp;rsquo;t know hardware that well so it was hard. The other dream I had was that the U.</description>

      <description>Well. Tonight I slept. Well I went to a bar after work with coworkers got a little tippsy and ate a hamburger.. came home and slept till eleven. and then negated any sleep by staying up way late. I then watched a bunch of TV and rotted my mind. Sometimes.. I feel like contirbuting to the delinquency of my palm pilot. So I keep looking at all the nifty INFOSEC stuff available right now.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t care if it is bigger than me. It is not fair that it has to oppress me so. I mean.. wtf.. So about 8 months ago I embedded &amp;ldquo;For Great Justice&amp;rdquo; into my IE titlebar via a quick registry hack.</description>

It was a &amp;ldquo;Battle Royal&amp;rdquo; of sorts between two &amp;ldquo;laptronica&amp;rdquo; teams. Each team had a tellytubby to fight out the matchs wrestling-style. The music was bomb and the teams were funny shit. I have never in all my years seen something so amusing. hehI also managed to get some connections with the chicago underground &amp;ldquo;geek&amp;rdquo; scene.</description>

      <description>So this weekend I went to an awesome juggling convention. It was called Madfest(Madison Festival). The jugglers there are some of the best in the entire world. They are all very nice and are quite talented.The show was incredible, the were at least 5 professional juggling acts and many more really great amateur acts. The MC was a lot better than QUad Cities and the humor was great. It was probably the best juggling show I have ever seen.</description>

      <description>So I went to school with this really nice but very strange young man from colorado. We hung out a little and we had a class together toward the end of last year. He seemed to be the &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; freshman, interested in getting drunk and being &amp;ldquo;wierd,&amp;rdquo; however.. I have just learned that this young man was arrested for some very strange reasons. Apparently he was helling about lovely money earnin Mount Vernon butt ass anked and decided to buy some candy.</description>

They are real nice. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how k*star doesn it. but she certainly picks god friends. all of her friends are nice. Unfortunantly I got a little ferschnickered tonight and wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to be a big help to k*star when she called me.</description>

Especially the &amp;ldquo;wisconson&amp;rdquo; college environment. Everyone has a little twang to their speech and they are all big drinkers. I guess that couldbe just college. There were pretty girls there. That is wierd huh. Pretty girls. Today I figured something rather pivitol out.</description>

      <description>Today a dumb ass cracker rooted one of my boxes. It was a cobalt RaQ and was running sendmail and an old version of sshd, so it &amp;ldquo;deserved it.&amp;rdquo; I had done a lot to make it more secure, however the default web admin tools that my clients use relied on sendmail and telnet and such. it was super sketchy. So anyway, the reason I say that it was a dumb ass cracker, was because they tried to install a rootkit on the box.</description>

      <description>I like buildings. When I was a child, my father subscribed to Architectural Digest. I used to read and look at the pictures of incredible architectural feats. I always imagined living in a place that had buildings that were nice. I finally found a building that is very nice. It is the R.R. donnelley building. Is a quite modern and has a neat lighting scheme. Inside it has incredible art and uses a lot of pretty black and white marble(i think).</description>

      <description>Today is kinda tough. I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep well last night.. maybe it had to do with me staying up until all hours of the morning. It is still hard, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I expect? I mean it has barely been two days since it happened. I guess I expect a drastic change.. like I will suddenly get over her. however.. I know that is impossible. I look at all the pictures I have, all the letters and I am scared to read them.</description>

      <description>today was hard. I was able to hold up. Work was ok. I am trying to decide a hobby. maybe direct TV hacking.. maybe console stuff.. maybe getting a no region dvd. . I am thinking about drowning my sorrows in technology(something I do really good) and buying a laptop. hmm.. but I need one with UXGA(ahhh 1600x1200), however that shit is expensive.. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay $2500 for a freaking computer(ha ha)  anyway.</description>

      <description>today, my girlfriend and I have decided to break up. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best of situations for each other&amp;hellip;. So after fourteen wonderful months together we are separating amicably. it was the only choice that allowed for us to maintain health and happiness. at least in our current situation.  However.. now I am a little lost.. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do or to say.. I type these words and fear a numbness that could quickly approach.</description>

      <description>Ha.. Well after numerous people have asked.. I did have a rough time lately. however I am ok now. I was just sad for a breif period and everyone left. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anyone to reflect off of, or to talk to, so I used the wonderful internet and the lovely &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; to be my emotional reflection pool. thanks for the support.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was kinnera&amp;rsquo;s birthday. Lets all say happy Birthday to her.  Tonight I went to a shoddy rock show and saw a guy who used to play with the smashing pumpkins. It was wierd because members of the &amp;ldquo;pumpkins&amp;rdquo; were at the show. Often when I see famous people it takes me a little while t figure out that they are real. I guess that is what I get for living in a fantasy world.</description>

      <description>Recently, I experienced something that could be described as a losing of faith. When I would it back and relax, I would not be able to relax - a sort of strife was happeneing in my head. However, recently I made peace with the contentious point and now I have nothing which is causing undesireables. Lucky for me. I guess I need to remember that it is important not to plan to far ahead when dealing with others, and that I should always live day by day - not week by week or month by month.</description>

      <description>Today is nerve racking. My brother is driving to california to begin what could be his career. He is actually going to go an dbe a commercial diver. He starts the vcational commercial diving achool on the 7th of january. It is pretty exciting. It reflects on me as being grown up. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to grow up. Things are also hard right now. I think that my relationship is slipping.</description>

      <description>So today my parents came to visit me. How nice it is to finally have something to do. My girlfriend is away again - off to see her parents. Alas, I wish I could be with her. Today we walked around, at at shoddy resturants and went and saw one of the best movies of all time. Lord Of The Rings. Boy oh Boy was it ever entertaining. It was very long, but I was able to handle it - in fact everyone was able to handle it.</description>

Boy, if I only knew what christmas break was like when I &amp;ldquo;grew up&amp;rdquo;, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have petereed away all my breaks when I was in school. I have a whole big 4 days. It is barely enough time to do anything. and to top it all off.. all my friends are disposed of, or away. alas.. I guess I will goto lord of the rings by myself.</description>

      <description>I was reading through a bunch of sites and I noticed some quite interesting movements in the &amp;ldquo;world.&amp;rdquo; First off, the incredible epiphany that two thrids of the world thinks that the U.S. is brought the terror onto itself. Also, in a very scary move, China has apparently been subtly supporting the al-Qaeda. Whoa. I hope bush does not take on the big red. Oh, and I guess the FBI and CIA are looking into a domestic threat of tactical nukes, and they think that nukes me already be here.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, just when I think I understand something it explodes and blows up in my face.. making me look silly and dumb. One of those things is corporate culture. I think it is very similar to the rings on a tree, but rather than age - it maps how slow to change the corporation is. Take my institution, it is a very old and rather successful company. Ithas maintained a profit on the web and uses a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; business model.</description>

      <description>Some people I am currently working with jsut told me about a crazy and very interesting genre of work. It is the PSYOPS. The propaganda and psychological movement behind the government and war. It seems very very cool. I also have been thinking recently about security and what I want to do when I grow up. I don&amp;rsquo;t know as of yet. Hmm.. maybe be some kind of security consultant&amp;hellip;. it is just that security certainly makes me excited.</description>

      <description>Today I visited another tier one hosting provider. It was nuts. Absolutly nuts. One of the cage facilities had a 300 terabyte tape drive. It looked like a space ship - or a nucular reactor. It was nuts. It probably cost enough to send my entire family to private liberal arts colleges in the midwest :)&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Awhile ago, when I first started dating my girlfriend a friend of mine used to allude to my relationship with her as the weather. He would say &amp;ldquo;hey harper, how is the weather&amp;rdquo; and per the current situation I would tailor the response. Well, my humble audience: the weather is great. In all situations&amp;hellip; The actual weather and my girlfriend. Eveything is nice and smooth and fun. I enjoy it. It is like 60 degrees out today and It has been like 1.</description>

      <description>So I have seen this site around the net for awhile and I went to it a couple time but it didn&amp;rsquo;t really make any sense. So today I read some of the stories and boy are they funny. I laughed a lot. a whole whole lot. damned funny if you ask me. It is about a crazy man in charge of a video game store, and his antics with really dumb customers.</description>

      <description>Oh boy, oh boy. Last night kstar came up and we went to the Britney Spears concert. We sat in our seats and realized that we were surrounded by screaming 13 year olds. It was insanity. O-town opened for her and they were horrible. They had a hip hop part.. they sang the puff daddy song &amp;ldquo;wanna be a baller,&amp;rdquo; it was funny the only guys who rapped were the &amp;ldquo;ethnic&amp;rdquo; guys.</description>

It was wacky, fun and quite interesting. I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn much - but I had a great time participating. To see the level of fun we had, chekc out these quotes. Also, does anyone know why cornell constantly screwes you out of stuff? It infuriates me anytime I think about them&amp;hellip; argghh</description>

      <description>So I was walking in DIA heading to my terminal when I noticed a set of &amp;ldquo;net terminals.&amp;rdquo; I laughed and thought &amp;ldquo;how nice, free internet. Now there is a business model that will work.&amp;rdquo; I think it was called go2net&amp;hellip; althought io don&amp;rsquo;t really remember. All I know is that they used linux and a slow version of netscape 4 and the terminal next to mine kernal panic&amp;rsquo;d.. hehe..  So anyway, I got to my plane, sat down in my seat and we taxied around the tarmack and then we got all iced up and then we got de-iced then iced and then de-iced and then the crew suddenly worked more than 16 hours and needed a break - so we headed back to a terminal.</description>

      <description>So I listen to metal. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to. It sort of follows me around. I assume it is because metal likes me. I mean, I could barely walk out of the CD store withou tthe entire Iron Maiden Catalog jumping into my pocket. WTF. But, there is a lot to metal I don&amp;rsquo;t like - for instance, pantera. WTF. I do not like Pantera. So without further ado I point you to this(part 2) site where they posted a fake personal ad to AOL from a non-existent &amp;ldquo;metal-chick.</description>

      <description>So, I had another weird dream. this one was quite scary - not that weird good scary either. Real real scary. Not fun. it went like this:  I was one of the head guys at a mental institution and I was in charge of combating all communicable diseases. So I got an alert of a breakout of this scary disease that turns ordinary people into shape shifters on a killing rampage.</description>

      <description>This weekend was a good time. I juggled and yoyoed and gained a bunch of inspiration to find and make new yoyo/diabolo tricks. I found a whole new way to yoyo. Lovely. It was quite strange, I met while juggling, a friend of a friends that just happened to be the proprietor of a web site I used to frequent. weird.I also was able to see my girlfriend. Imagine, just 12 months ago I was pineing over her - trying ot get up the courage to ask her out, and now.</description>

Together we have been through almost everything. how nice. I enjoy it so so much. Walking last night, we found one of these.</description>

      <description>Last night I went to an incredible show. I saw the Faint, which is a great band out of Omaha. They are a little like the Cure, but a little more upbeat and a little more dancy. It was quite good, the first two bands sucked however&amp;hellip; Then, I met some really cool kids after the show and went down to the smartbar and chilled for awhile. It was nice. I then went to my faorite haunt, and then went to a goth bar.</description>

      <description>Today I saw the band Anniversary. They were interesting. Not really as good as I thought. It is weird when you go see a lot of bands that you listen to often ? I feel I know every lick, every lyric and every guitar riff, and when the band does something creative in concert it annoys me. Luckily with bands like modest mouse, the creativity is very solid ? and with built to spill, they were right on.</description>

      <description>First, I really miss block breaks. I am horribly stuck. I wish my company was a more liberal dot com. I wish it was 99-2000 and I was a high profile consultant. I really wish that the company I work for was interested in making the employees happy. WHich they seemingly arn&amp;rsquo;t. It seems that profit is the key, but even when I can identify things which are easy and would save money - getting them approved would cost more money then the initial savings.</description>

      <description>Please check out http://www.watership.org, http://indymedia.org/ and http://slashdot.org for more information on the terrorist attack on the U.S. This is not good. Very much a bad situation.
Look at what we have so far:
 &amp;ldquo;We (members of the german army) have been put on alert, people are being revoked from holiday, all system/material checked, no talk policy. &amp;rdquo; (sid=21542&amp;amp;cid=2277927)
&amp;ldquo;The US military is on alert. For security reasons I can&amp;rsquo;t post more details, but the 82nd airborne division has been told to suit up and according to one report one unit is already in the air, though they&amp;rsquo;re not sure where they&amp;rsquo;ll be landing yet.</description>

      <description>So my girlfriend and myself have been dating 10 months. That is a real long time for me. I mean it is nothing compared to some lucky peoples marriage, but it is like 80% of a year, 304 days, a little over 1 million seconds(i think :)). So anyway, i am excited to go and see her at college. Hopefully all goes well and i get to go visit. I miss her terribly.</description>

Doug(if that is his name) was a good guitar player. The audience was OK, Except for some assholes who were harrasing a simple drunk man. I was sad for him. But eventually the dumbasses were kicked out.. weee..</description>

      <description>i really don&amp;rsquo;t know if i like anime or not. At first the fascination was based on experiencing something i had never experienced before. Then it got wierd. I kinda liked it because i was supposed to like it - according to the code of computer nerd. But now i am starting to get more into it. I just saw blood and it was really good. It was by the guys who did ghost in the shell, which i really enjoy.</description>

      <description>So K*star left for school today, it was wierd. I want to goto school again. I am through with this grown up crap. I liked college better. I like being around K*star better :) Anyway, why is it that we have to grow up. I hate it. Its dumb..I really miss having food prepared for me, having everything paid for. Having the worst thing be a missed party or something a long those lines.</description>

      <description>So ihad this very strange dream. I dremt that lamprey like fish had started to colonize humans. They would come and dig themselves down your throat and when you breathed they would just pass the air through them and you &amp;ldquo;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; notice. I mean you would notice but you were still able to breathe &amp;ldquo;normally.&amp;rdquo; Well anyway, the lampreys were attaching themselves to humans and a regiment was created to purge yourself of the lamprey.</description>

      <description>So I saw madonna the other night, and i would like to say that she is very good in concert. I think that she may have put on the best concert i have ever seen(i have seen a few). She had great choreography, and incredible sets and costumes. It was quite spectacular. I would love to go again, and i have been scouring ebay for more tickets. The only problem was, that our tickets weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly &amp;ldquo;great.</description>

      <description>I am sitting here waiting for this program i wrote that parses log files to finish, and reading news online. I am trying hard not to read anything about Bush. Cuz he scares the hell out of me. Headlines lie &amp;ldquo;Bush states that the US WILL withdraw from missile treaty&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Bush appoints Air Force Man to joint chiefs of staff&amp;rdquo; and other scary cold warish things. I think that the sign of a bad president is when things DO happen.</description>

I knew i was among friends. WHat a piece of work most of the people were.</description>

      <description>So i sent off my server today. It was wierd just packing it in a box and sending it to someone whom i have never met or really talked to a lot. The place that is cohostin git seems kinda sketchy, but at the same time also seems really cool. They are a backbone provider for Ohio State, and the State of Ohio :)&amp;hellip; so the bandwidth will be good - and i will be hooked pretty much directly on the backbone.</description>

      <description>I have decided that the reason the 3rd of july is so big is that chicago is a working city. a city where eveyone get the 4th off, but most don&amp;rsquo;t have th 5th off. so they go an party on the 3rd - cuz they don&amp;rsquo;t have to get up the next they. But they don&amp;rsquo;t want to on the 4th cuz they have to get up on the 5th.</description>

      <description>I recreated my weblogging system. It no longer supports comments, however it is cooler and prettier. and most importantly you can syndicate it using rss.php and you can view it on a wap enabled browser(i.e. cell phone).

      <description>So i was reading the New Yorker Magazine when i noticed that all of the cartoons were making fun of .coms failing. And then i noticed that all my computer nerd friends who aren&amp;rsquo;t working for an insurance company or working for a hardcore company are getting fired and not getting jobs. All my friends that are graduating are not getting hired. I have a job at a non-tech .com, and many of my friends are getting offered small time contract work.</description>

      <description>Hey yall, I have been reading some books for the last couple of months that deal with the after effects of imperialism. Why is it that the nature of humanity is to destroy/assimilate culture and life of others. I find this disturbing, but mostly because it is an easy racket to get involved in. Is it hard, to maintain a cultural identity within the pseudo &amp;ldquo;melting pot&amp;rdquo; of the U.S.</description>

      <description>I start school again. I am not as excited as i should be, cuz i got latin. I hate latin. Its too hard to be fun. i wish it were like &amp;ldquo;really advanced generic computer science that is too hard for everyone&amp;rdquo; becuase than i would have a chance to have fun. But nope&amp;hellip; the final latin class calls my name. I also need to finish my symposium project.</description>

      <description>Today i went to the art institute of chicago and looked at the contemporary and modern paintings&amp;hellip; it was bad ass.. anyway i also looked at some of the oldest books i have ever read. I started with a book published in the early 18th century(1722) about the plurality of worlds, it was qute something.. i have never read a book that was so informal. And the secod set of books were translations of the 17th century philosopher named&amp;hellip; well i forgot but the book s were translated into english about 1640 or so&amp;hellip; damn old books, smell ed bad&amp;hellip; but whatever&amp;hellip;</description>
