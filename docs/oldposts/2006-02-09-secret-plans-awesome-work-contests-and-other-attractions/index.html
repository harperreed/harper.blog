    <p>Whew.</p>

<p>I have this secret plan to start blogging more regularly and to up the level of intelligence that go into the posts. I am trying to diminish the amount of &ldquo;so. i went to a club and then i went to another club and there were people&rdquo; posts - instead having &ldquo;so. i went to a club and there were these people and they do interesting things like&hellip;.&rdquo; and then post more often and more about technology. like how to solve problems that i have solved recently and all that nonsense. i imagine i will do something like that&hellip; soon. i just get home from work and don&rsquo;t want to post - or are at work and am busy. like i tell all my friends who are starting blogs (especially the ones who are attempting to make money at it): you should schedule a time and then collect your thoughts for your blogging time. then the posts are more thought out and possibly more interesting to read.</p>

<p>So what HAS been going on with me lately. Well:
<ul>
    <li>i widened my blog. i thought it might be helpful to make the thing more readable.</li>
    <li>mark and i redid <a href="http://howtoyoyo.com">howtoyoyo.com</a>. we redid it in a whole new style. concentrating more on the online media. we have like 400mb of videos that we are hosting. it is turning out really well.</li>
    <li>i worked with VI on this cool project called <a href="http://www.yellowikis.us">yellowikis.us</a>. i need to wrap it up. but we have been so busy it is stagnent.</li>
    <li>i learned voip really well. i hacked together a system to allow my foreign friends to call the us cheaply using a computer. I also made a tokyo number ring my cell phone. i have been programming dynamic dial plans in php for fun. it rules. i should release my software. i need to finish up my asterisk manager implementation.</li>
    <li>and i have been working a lot</li>
</ul>
I can always tell when work is ruling - cuz i don&rsquo;t post, i don&rsquo;t complain about it and i think about it in the shower, while sleeping, on the bus.. etc. Lately i have been coding some <a href="http://www.extratasty.com/mobile/">really cool stuff</a>. mostly relating to our shortcode(TASTY) and the logic that is going into the transactions for that. I wrote some really cool pieces that parse out messages into parts, make sure we don&rsquo;t flood a cell phone, determine what the user wants and does some simple lowest cost routing for SMS messages. heh. oh&hellip; telecom. how i love thee.</p>

<p>Another cool thing going on at work is our underground sale. <a href="http://jakenickell.com/entry/1114">Jake had this idea for a sale</a> on <a href="http://www.threadless.com">threadless</a> that we didn&rsquo;t advertise anywhere but a few very specific people. So we all decided on some good people to invite into our experiment and we gave them each a coupon. and then we have a graph that tracks how they are doing. if you would like to participate in the sale - just use: <strong>tenbucks87</strong> and buy 3 or more shirts. you will get them for 10 each. w00t. <a href="http://www.threadless.com">threadless</a>!!!</p>

<p>Jake also had suggested to me that i integrate my threadless pictures more into my blog. Since i upload so many with my fancy <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A//press.nokia.com/PR/200504/991482_5.html&ei=K-jqQ-rZF6KOowKf8o22Bg&sig2=JUjFVQeLE97-jBH9ovMlYw">N70</a> and <a href="http://www.shozu.com">shozu</a> it is easy for me to have a &ldquo;moblog&rdquo; and the recent photos section doesn&rsquo;t really cut it. i really like how <a href="http://jakenickell.com">jake does it</a> and it really hits home in regards what i think is cool right now. i am really into blogs turning into aggregate views of ones online persona. i don&rsquo;t want to just see what someone has to say. i want to see where they are, what <a href="http://www.flickr.com">pictures they have taken</a> and what links they are <a href="http://www.del.icio.us">clicking to</a>. i would also love to see what they are buying, what they are watching and what they are reading - <a href="http://www.musicblogger.org">let alone what they are listening to</a>.</p>

<p>in mid march i am going to tokyo to visit <a href="http://www.hirominakazawa.com">hiromi</a>. i am quite excited. i miss her quite a bit and it will be nice to see her place and what not. i am also excited to be in tokyo. my dream is to somehow become a pop star while i am there. i have this theory that if i just run around - it is bound to happen. heh.</p>

<p>i am going to go get my super dry laundry and then goto bed. i just finished <a href="http://destroytechnology.com/dark-1000-0765308851-Tatja_Grimms_World">tatja grimm</a> - the new <a href="http://destroytechnology.com/d3-Vernor_Vinge">vernor vinge book</a>. it was really good. i didn&rsquo;t like it at first. but it grew on me. now i am going to read something less cool. hah.</p>
