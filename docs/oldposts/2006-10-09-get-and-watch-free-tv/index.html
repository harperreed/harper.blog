  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>So I canceled directTV awhile back and have been struggling to figure out how to easily download the shows I want to watch. I would love to do it legally. I have looked into the itunes solution - but they don&rsquo;t have all I need/want. And it won&rsquo;t work for hiromi - in japan. So I needed something that wasn&rsquo;t region specific and something that wasn&rsquo;t hard.</p>

<p>With these requirements I poked around quite a bit. Having looked into <a href="http://www.azaurus.com/">azaurus</a> and <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">bittorrent</a> with RSS. It was a pain and I couldn&rsquo;t possibly use it regularly. I also have terrible luck over time with azaurus. It rules when I have time - but when I leave for a week and comeback to it - I have no idea what&rsquo;s going on. So - I then looked into DDL sites. They were lame and too much work. So annoying.</p>

<p>I had great hope in the allsimps.com site. But it was taken down. weird I know.</p>

<p>Finally after looking and looking - I found what I was looking for in a video client that I had already looked into. I had originally downloaded and played with the Democracy video client years ago. It wasn&rsquo;t very intuitive. Or maybe I wasn&rsquo;t into it. But regardless - I left it installed and then stopped using it. Then a week ago I read the <a href="http://lifehacker.com">lifehacker</a> article about using <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/bittorrent/hack-attack-get-your-tv-season-pass-with-democracy-204057.php">Democracy and TV RSS feeds to stay updated on torrents of your favorite TV shows</a>. All seamlessly. it is pretty dope.</p>

<p>This is what I have done (it is outlined in much greater detail in the lifehacker article):
<blockquote>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Download</a> and install the democracy client</li>
    <li>Find your <a href="http://tvrss.net/shows/">favorite TV shows</a> at <a href="http://tvrss.net">tvRSS</a></li>
    <li>Add the RSS feed from the TV show listing to democracy</li>
    <li>Hang out for a minute (go outside and juggle)</li>
    <li>Watch your shows</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
I was taking about  30min to download each show - with some taking much longer. It seemed that it was reasonably fast - especially when ran at night. I now just have to remember to watch the shows. Luckily democracy will delete old and watched shows after a specific duration.</p>

<p>So now I can watch TV on any of my laptops. I do wish I could throttle the Democracy player a bit more. It seems that having it run only at night would be a good plan. The coolest part about the player is how it is a bittorrent client as well as a player - so the problem of people closing their clients after they are done downloading an episode is a bit diminished. woot.</p>

<p>I guess the next step is trying to get <a href="http://torrentocracy.com/documentation.shtml">this integrated</a> into a <a href="http://www.mythtv.org//">MythTV</a> box. I think that would be excellent. And after hacking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivo#Controversies">Tivo</a> to all its ends - I think its time to <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/dvr/hack-attack-build-your-own-dvr-165963.php">roll my own PVR</a>. heh.</p>
