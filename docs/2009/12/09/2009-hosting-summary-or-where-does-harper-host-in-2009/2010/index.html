I guess I will go ahead and jump in. This is based on what I use and would most likely suggest if we were drinking beers and talking about hosting. Your mileage may vary. I am sorry if I end up causing a nuclear war based on these recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Platforms&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Two platforms are really getting me going these days. Google&rsquo;s App Engine and Heroku.</p>

<p>App Engine is known by my close friends as my true love (haha. second only to <a href="http://hiromiusagi.com">my lovely wife</a>). I spend almost 90% of my development time hacking on App Engine apps (<a href="http://Excla.im">Excla.im</a>, <a href="http://CityPayments.org">CityPayments</a>, <a href="http://ChicagoAlerts.org">ChicagoAlerts</a>, <a href="http://chicagowiki.transitapi.com/">Transitapi</a>, <a href="http://AwesomeUpdater.com">AwesomeUpdater</a>, and <a href="http://harpersfriends.com">Harper&rsquo;s Friends</a>). App Engine does a few things very well and allows the developer to do the rest. Quite a few of the lessons I learned while scaling out Threadless are baked into the app by default. You don&rsquo;t have to scale all the pieces independently and you can really take care of things all at once. I recommend it and use it for prototyping and building new apps.</p>

<p><a href="http://Heroku.com">Heroku</a>! I go to <a href="http://Heroku.com">Heroku.com</a> I spend about 10 minutes <a href="http://heroku.com/pricing">playing with sliders, clicking on features</a> and acting like I am going to deploy an app to their infrastructure. It&rsquo;s awesome. Heroku makes me want to learn ruby frameworks well and build applications fast. It seems that it might be expensive though. I would love to know if people have actually used it in paid production environments (i have only done hackings).</p>

<p>If you are interested in <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, Ruby/Rails or JVM languages (I am looking at you <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1831">Scala</a>!) - I highly recommend App Engine or Heroku.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; Server Providers</strong></p>

<p>Cloud Servers are amazing things. Usually they are <a href="http://xen.org/">XEN</a> hosted and wrapped by an API or a nice pretty interface. I &lt;3 them. If I would have had these server options in 2001 I would have been able to make the server kingdom I dreamt about. It would be awesome. Luckily, now in <sup>2009</sup>&frasl;<sub>2010</sub> I can build my server kingdom in the <a href="http://www.nepholologist.com/">CLOUDS</a>. Anyway&hellip;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> is my favorite. I really enjoy the user interface. I prefer websites with less buttons. Slicehost delivers. However, it doesn&rsquo;t explicitly have usage based billing (pay per hour) - which is why i am also excited about <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/servers">Rackspace Cloud Servers</a>. Rackspace Cloud is everything you need to have fun with servers and host enterprise apps. My most recent Cloud server was used to pop up a <a href="http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-configure-pptp-vpn-in-ubuntu-intrepid-and-jaunty.html">VPN</a> in Ubuntu so I could use public wifi without being frightened. It took about 10 minutes from deciding to do it, to connecting with my macbook pro. awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a> is pretty sweet as well. It is the heavy duty infrastructure that powers so many awesome sites. I really like watching what Amazon is doing. Amazing stuff. I am super excited about booting from the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">EBS</a>. However, I don&rsquo;t like the complexity that comes with EC2 by default. Which is why I only use EC2 if I need AWS specific utilities.</p>

<p>Sidenote: <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=1762fce92f905a07a8623481199299b3ab8a90b9">Linode</a> is getting a lot of buzz based on their <a href="http://blog.linode.com/2009/12/04/linode-stomps-competition-in-performance-benchmark/">performance/cost ratio</a>. I recommend you <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=1762fce92f905a07a8623481199299b3ab8a90b9">take a look</a> at them and see if they will work for you.</p>

<p>If you do find yourself in the dark world of cloud servers, you should check out my favorite utility for managing all things servers: <a href="https://www.cloudkick.com/">CloudKick</a>. CloudKick is a pretty solid app that allows you manage your all your Rackspace and Amazon servers. You can do it very easily and with very few buttons (I love a small amount of buttons).</p>

<p>If you are looking for awesome easy servers - use Rackspace Cloud Servers. If you are looking for a full stack (load balancer, block storage and what not) - use Amazon. I use Rackspace Cloud Servers.</p>

<p><strong>File Hosting and Serving.</strong></p>

<p>File hosting is simple stuff. I follow this simple guideline:</p>

<p>If you want to host a file for everyone (i.e. a popular image, a iso, download etc) where performance is important - use <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/files">Rackspace Cloud Files</a> with limelight integration. This is the closest you will come to paying for enterprise CDN capabilities for a tiny amount of money. You can&rsquo;t beat the level of performance that <a href="http://www.limelightnetworks.com/">limelight</a> offers (unless you want to pay for <a href="http://www.akamai.com">Akamai</a>).</p>

<p>If you need to put a BUNDLE of files somewhere that needs to be public or private - use Cloud Files or <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>. Depending entirely on what vendor you like or what API you are most familiar with. I use both for backing up various data from my servers and home (I recommend <a href="http://www.s3rsync.com/">s3sync</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/s3fs/">s3fs</a> for S3 or <a href="http://westhoffswelt.de/projects/mossofs.html">MossoFS</a>, <a href="http://blog.chmouel.com/2009/09/02/rsync-like-backup-to-rackspace-cloud-file-with-duplicity/">CloudFiles/Duplicity</a> for Cloud Files).</p>

<p><strong>Multi Tenant/Shared Hosting.</strong></p>

<p>Shared hosting is such a pain in the ass. ;) I really don&rsquo;t like it. However, I use it because of the price and because of how easy it is to host stuff for friends and others.</p>

<p>I use two providers regularly for shared hosting:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=harper">Webfaction</a> is by far my favorite multi tenant hosting company. It is SUPER NERD. They have this unique approach to hosting based on proxying a bunch of servers through apache. This allows you to easily host a django app that has a rails component and a wordpress blog all at the same domain root. You can even compile your own build of whatever flavor of server you like best. Its a great place for prototyping servers and generally having a great time inlinux. Webfaction also has a <a href="http://forum.webfaction.com/">developer community</a> that offers great support. I host most of my personal stuff onWebfaction (this blog, <a href="http://harperreed.org">harperreed.org</a>, etc).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/sites">Rackspace Cloud Sites</a> is a great multi tenant platform. I use it hosting various apps for your friends and family. It is a no brainer to light up a domain for my brother or friend and have them host it. The only problem I have with Cloud Sites is that sometimes you have to compromise your code to fit in their super scalable infrastructure. You will NEVER go down - but you might have to tweak your drupal or wordpress code to make it easy.</p>

<p>If file storage is just what you need - then check out <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159982">Dreamhost</a>. For the love of god they have cheap prices. I looked today and they were offering unlimited everything (that doesn&rsquo;t make sense). The only problem is that they don&rsquo;t allow you to use it as a backup service (y<a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/backup-files-on-dreamhost-web-hosting-servers/4538/">ou have to use the space in a very specific way</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Enterprise/Physical Servers.</strong></p>

<p>Enterprise servers are easy. You use <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a>. ;) Seriously though - while at <a href="http://threadless.com/">Threadless</a>, Rackspace saved our asses more than once. Using Rackspace allowed us to concentrate on our application rather than concentrate on our servers. Although they can be expensive - they offer so much that it is often worth it.</p>

<p>If you are looking for something a bit cheaper or a bit more hands on, I suggest my favorite chicago hosting company: <a href="http://fdcservers.net/">FDCServers.net</a>. They offer great support and cheap servers. You are not going to get near the support that Rackspace offers, but you are going to pay a LOT less. I host a couple big apps at FDC and have had no problems at all.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong></p>

<p>This wraps up my hosting review. I recommend App Engine, Cloud Servers, Cloudfiles/S3 and Rackspace Managed hosting. heh. See - super easy. All your hosting questions are answered.</p>

<p>2010 is going to be an exciting year. I imagine that Rackspace and Amazon will continue to fight head to head. Which will only make us consumers have better options. I also am very excited to see what Google does with App Engine (I imagine that they will NOT be adding <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=13">PHP support</a>). I hope that 2010 is as productive as 2009 was for hosting, if so - then it will be an exciting, innovative time.</p>

<p>Leave your questions in the comments - I will attempt to answer them the best i can.</p>
