    <p>So today after running some errands downtown i came home and about died. I slept like a baby until around 10. confused and hungry i awoke. I felt like hell still. which sucked. I was totally (totally dude) supposed to go to a bbq around 7. But i just didn&rsquo;t have it in me. and now its 11:39 and i am still achey and tired.</p>

<p>However, after i ate and chilled for a minute, i decided to try the neti pot again. and this time it wasn&rsquo;t as rough as the first time - however it still was rough. It is fun though to watch all the water come through your nose. hah. and i really do love how i can breathe better through my nose now. w00t w00t. maybe i am a convert.. hmm.. i think it still is a bit uncomfortable.</p>

<p>I just don&rsquo;t want to  be sick at all when i go and visit hiromi. that would be sad. so early to bed. early to rise. good food to eat. and no stress for the next week.</p>

<p>My mom is coming into town this weekend with my cousin, cole. i am excited.  more on that later..</p>
