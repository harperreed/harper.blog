    <p>So tonight i have been playing with <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Aparts</a> VOX blog service. Besides the confusing name (probably only confusing to me - the alcoholic podcaster) <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Aparts</a>  social network blog thing is pretty cool. Check out my profile <a href="http://nata2.vox.com/profile/">here</a> and my &ldquo;blog&rdquo; <a href="http://nata2.vox.com/profile/">here</a>. I like the idea behind the <a href="http://www.vox.com/">VOX</a> social network. I have long thought that <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">SA</a> is pretty smooth at executing products. The Movable Type platform was always nice looking and easy to use. <a href="http://www.vox.com/">Vox</a> is very similar. It is pretty. Smooth. Ajaxy in the right places. and generally feels like a social application. I really like how they are trying to be interoperable between different services(<a href="http://www.amazon.com">amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.photobucket.com">photobucket</a>, etc) and i enjoyed putting some books and what not into their system. I was annoyed they couldn&rsquo;t just look up my youtube videos by my username and that i have to grab pictures from my flickr photostream and place them by hand into <a href="http://www.vox.com/">VOX</a> - it seems that with some simple modifications they ultimately could become a very nice aggregate social network. allowing users to view and interact with all your bits and pieces from around the internet.</p>

<p>One thing that really is starting to piss me off is this &ldquo;lets start a new blog&rdquo; bullshit. WTF. I have had the same blog since <sup>1999</sup>&frasl;<sub>2000</sub>. I don&rsquo;t want a new blog. In fact i hate new blogs. One of my pet peeves is when people change blogs like they change clothes. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense in my head. So why would i start a new blog if i already have my own. Why doesn&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.vox.com/">VOX</a>, <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">360</a>, myspace just import my rss feed. I would love to have more people intereact with my posts. i just don&rsquo;t want to write 4 posts for 4 blogs. i can barely keep up with this one.</p>

<p>I would sign up for vox if you have a chance. I like it. I will maybe keep updating it. Especially if it becomes easier and easier.</p>

<p>On a completely different note. Can someone invite me to share a <a href="http://www.writely.com/">writely</a> document. I really want to check out that product. I just started to using google <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com">spreadsheets</a> and i would love to start using writely.</p>
