    <p>I am freezing. Seriously. It suddenly got like 100 below zero up in this piece. But never fear. i have a coat. and i will where it when i go outside. Which doesn&rsquo;t help me while i am cold here in my living room. hah. last night or maybe it was the previous night - i was ready for snow. but now that it is colder than it was, i am not ready for snow. hah.</p>

<p>and i am wearing the same pair of shorts i have worn everyday since the beginning of june. these are some worn in shorts. and very inappropriate for the weather. i just need to pull my socks up more.</p>

<p>So this weekend was pretty fun. kinda crazy. I have still be sleepy since returning from tokyo and i have been needing a lot of naps and whatnot. so that has been interesting. Juggling naps and whatnot with going out and work. I sleep a LOT. on friday i was meeting up with derek and tag to go out and rumble in the bronx. So i came home from work. and immediately slept until 10. Like no problem. Got up. Met <a href="http://derek.broox.com/">derek</a>. and stumbled to the underdog to get a hot dog. it was gross. not the best culinary decision i have made recently. We randomly met up with <a href="http://www.danielleclock.org/blog/">clock</a> and then met tag and and co at tumans. We hung out with kira and the girls at tumans and got tired of the madness of hipsters - so we went to liars club. After the naked guy danced to nelly and we were tired of badly dressed wierdos and crazy people we went to cobra lounge. Man. I love cobra lounge. It plays metal. Has weirdos and generally is a great place. We stayed their until it closed. Then we went to crobar.  After danielle used her &ldquo;endownment&rdquo; to get us shots and expensive drinks - the night turned really crazy and fun. We just ran around and verbally abused each other until we had the worse pizza in the word. Not a good scene. I think it hurt us all.</p>

<p>Then saturday. I hung out with jeffrey and then napped. I slept from like 4 until 9:30. wtf. Then i met up with matiss and erica to watch <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0435625/">descent</a>. It ruled. So scary. So claustrophobic . The weird orc miner creatures were pretty scary and the gore was plentiful. It was nice to see a decent horror movie that involves scary shit without stupid stupid plots.  After the movie i met up with tag and jordan and went to <a href="http://www.darkroombar.com/">darkroom</a> to see  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/flosstradamus">Flosstradamus</a> spin. It owned. Their was more streetwear in darkroom than at a bape convention. It was retarded. Jordan and i joked that you could make a parachute from all the bandanas around peoples necks. They aren&rsquo;t cowboys at all. It was pretty fun. A lot of good shirts. hah. i shoudl have worn one of mine out. hah. Tag an i weren&rsquo;t really feeling the vibe so we swiftly went over to y bar. I love y bar. For some reason it is exactly what i want a lot of the time. And it is fun to hang out with hiroki. Then soundbar where <a href="http://www.wylywade.com/">wyly</a> met up with us and we proceeded to get really drunk and stupid. fun. and insane.</p>

<p>Then today i woke up. chilled out. watched broken flowers and wrote this. hah. now LAUNDRY!</p>
