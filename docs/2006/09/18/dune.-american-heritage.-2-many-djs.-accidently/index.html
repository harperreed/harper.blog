    <p>I am watching the <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/">bbs documentary</a>. Its amazing. I started watching clive barker&rsquo;s Lord of Illusions - but it sucked. It always sucked. It sucked when i saw it in the theatre and it sucks now. So as soon as i remembered that it blew - i also remembered how awesome the BBS Doc was. So i put it in and now it is awesome. AWESOME i say.</p>

<p>I kinda want to run a bbs on one of my boxes. probably synchronet. If anyone wants in - leave a comment and i will hook it up. I think it will be mainly a way to irc. and play door games ;)</p>

<p>So tonight was a night of synchronicity. I started out reading dune. I ordered it and it arrived friday. I finished it this afternoon. It was amazing.  I remember my dad mentioning it when i was a kid - but for some reason i never wanted to read it. Until i was tired of all the books i had sitting by my bed. So <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">dune</a> was amazing. AMAZING. I totally understand why it was so popular. I am weighing whether i should read that rest of the books by Frank Herbert. I am not really into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_Universe">dune universe</a> at all - just the initial story.</p>

<p>I love wikipedia. What is right about it is all that is wrong with the commercial encyclopedias. What is wrong with it - is what is right about all the pay sites. lame.</p>

<p>So anyway. Tonight and how things work. So after dune was finished, i went to subT to watch <a href="http://www.americanfuckingheritage.com/">american heritage</a> play for their record release party. I bought their cd and their awesome shirt. It ruled. While their i saw my buddy choke and we hung out. Talked cabinets with one of his band mates and just chilled. Then while walking home i ran into jordan and used his +1 for the soulwax/2manydjs party. So good. I was very very surprised.</p>

<p>Now back to the BBS Doc. hah.</p>
