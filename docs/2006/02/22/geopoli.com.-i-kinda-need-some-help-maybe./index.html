  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>I need some new sites. Speaking of which - I am making a new site: geopoli.com. It is a geotargeted political banner ad and text ad delivery site. I want to make it so you can include a dynamic image or JS code snippet on your blog or myspace profile and it will display to your users a text ad or banner ad saying &ldquo;YOU LIVE IN CHICAGO. SEND OBAMA an EMAIL.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea is that when the user clicked on the ad it would take the user to a place that would allow the user to contact their representative. i want it to be unpartisan and sorta non-issue based - so that people are not specifically using it to badger users.</p>

<p>I feel that this coming spring, summer and fall -being politically active will be very important. After listening to <a href="http://www.thisishell.net">this is hell</a> for a couple weeks and reading a bunch - i have decided that the US is on the brink of destroying the world. if we attack iran, the world as we know it will be over. and i feel that the only we can get our representatives to pay attention is to bitch at them a bit. and i think places like myspace are a great place to gather some momentum. and the first part of momentum is showing people who they are representated by.</p>

<p>So i have written a basic test to tell you where you are from. i am using the <a href="http://www.hostip.info">hostip.info</a> database, it is nice but sadly inadequate.  It works pretty well - but it doeasn&rsquo;t quite cover everything. But i have written a really nice (if i may say so myself) class to interact with whichever geo-ip system i choose. the only problem i have now is that i am unable to grab the zip-code from the ip with good precision. that isn&rsquo;t such a problem - i am able to get a pretty high level idea - but it would be nice to be able to hit closer to the user. To solve this i am correlating the lat/long from the geo-ip lookup with the <a href="http://zips.sourceforge.net/">freeware zips database</a>. its rough and slow but it works pretty well.</p>

<p>The second problem i am facing is that i need a place to driect the users who see the ads.  where should i redirect them. i was thinking to congress.org - but it seems kinda sketchy. not bad sketchy - but i don&rsquo;t trust something i don&rsquo;t understand completely. And they have weird terms of service which i am sure i would inadvertently break.</p>

<p>So that is what i am thinking of. what i am doing. and how i am doing it. I want it to be no more complicated than making a flickr badge - and no less functional. It needs to be able to interact and intrigue the user.</p>

<p>i think its a cool idea.</p>
