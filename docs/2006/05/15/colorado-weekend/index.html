    <p>This weekend was pretty nice. I went to colorado to help my dad with his webpage, visit my family and for mothersday. I always forget how pretty it is in colorado. I am always a bit surprised when i see the mountains or the sunset. Also the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145761074/">weather is so nice</a>. a lot nicer than chicago. Especially this weekend.</p>

<p>I got in late on friday and i just ate easy mac, slept and read a bit. Then on saturday i got up early and went to my dads business and got some info about their site. Then i met up with my brother and we had a nice lunch at wendy&rsquo;s. For the afternoon i napped, read a bit and played computer for a minute. That afternoon i helped my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145775538/">father</a> do some <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145756712/">yardwork</a>. It was fun. Basically i just stood there postulating about the neighbors. hah. After that, my mom, dad and I went to <a href="http://www.meltingpot.com/">Melting Pot</a> for <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145933684/">fondue</a>. It was really good. During our meal <a href="http://hirominakazawa.com">hiromi</a> called so my parents were able to chat with her for a second. It was nice. It was fun to talk and hang out. Then on sunday we had a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/146407893/">nice meal</a> celebrating mothers day. Dylan was able to make it and, as per usual, was dressed like a clown. Pretty sweet.</p>

<p>Then we watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0375679/">crash</a>. That is a rough movie. I liked it a lot - but found it to be quite stressful. I wasn&rsquo;t really interested in being so stressed but it was nice. I also finished my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312856849/sr=8-1/qid=1147723641/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-1931212-2834515?%5Fencoding=UTF8">first book</a> of my set of 1 million books i got. heh.</p>

<p>I then barely made it home. ;) but i did. and now i am here.</p>

<p>It was a great quick weekend. As usual, i am constantly reminded of how <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145753670/">weird and funny</a> my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/145661121/">brother</a> is. Sadly, <a href="http://photodork.org/">sarah</a> was a bit under the weather and i didn&rsquo;t get to see her. next time!</p>
