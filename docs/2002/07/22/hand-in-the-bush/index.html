    <p>So anyway. this weekend was incredibly hot. like not fun hot. I was not excited. I can&rsquo;t quite remember what exactly went down this weekend. but I think we mostly hung out. My friend brock and amanda hung out on thursday.. friday I hung out with my friend sevren and some of his friends. they are so &ldquo;classy.&rdquo; hehe. but the real gem(hehe) was on saturday. Some new friends of ours came over about one.. we went downtown and hung out and I street performed with matiss. We got there late.. which sucked for matiss. he had arrived downtown around seven.. an had to juggle without a break until like 1:30 or 2:30. that was rough for him I think. anyway. after we juggled.. we went to whole foods and got a whole bunch of food and cooked it in a big group effort. it ruled.We played slot cars(of course) and the letter game. and all sorts of other things. we then went to a birthday party and eventually to sleep. Then came the evil of sunday. however.. we killed the heat with bad movies.. reading.. and board games.. ugh.. so so hot.<br/>
<ul>
<li>I guess that we get a police state for our summer present. I am <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20020722-6619304.htm">excited</a>. It seems that quite a few politicians want to give the military policing power. I think that this woudl be a bad idea.</p>

<p><li>Gore apparently for some silly reason claims that &ldquo;<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&cid=664&u=/ap/20020721/ap_to_po/gore_3&printer=1">Bush lied about the nation&rsquo;s economy.</a>&rdquo; Gore is probably sore about losing or something.</p>

<p><li>It seems that the number of sexually active teenagers has <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20020722-76660856.htm">dropped</a>. Wierd.</p>

<p><li>The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Conference 2002 has officially made a call to initiate a <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-push21.html">probe</a> into the corporate accounting scandals of the GOP. It seems that &ldquo;President Bush&rsquo;s trading in corporate stock and Vice President Dick Cheney&rsquo;s tenure as chief executive of Halliburton Co., as well as activities by other high-ranking administration figures, were questionable enough to merit a Ken Starr-type federal investigation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><li>I love when reality becomes similar to the beginning of a horror movie. the pentagon is attempting to create <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,322588,00.html">nonlethal weapons</a> that hurt but don&rsquo;t kill. This is where a strange and undocumented side effect creates zombies.. or turns people into mindless killers. hehe. we can only hope ey. yea. wierd.
<li>a friend of mine wrote <a href="http://www.stoneeye.com/eyetalknow/oped/07-20-02.html">this </a> commentary about the auto industry. It is an interesting read.
</ul>
Well I supposed that is all. Soon I goto california. and I get to visit my brother. it shoudl be a good time. I am excited. I want to go on dates with girls someday.  heh. I may be dreaming again. huh. haha.</p>
