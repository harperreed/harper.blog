<br/>so tonight.. I went out with a friend. it was really great. we got italian ice. and hung out.. went to a park. chilled. it was a great night out. I love how people say. its a great night out. for some reason it seems so nice right now. that phrase. but whatever. I laugh a lot at my own minds meandering.. I wonder if it as amusing to others as it is to me. probably not. so anyway. I had a great time. <b>;)</b>.<br/><br/>so my friend robyn has a profile on moc. heh. and she also has a <a hef=http://www.livejournal.com/users/velmaodella">livejournal</a>. check it out.</p>
