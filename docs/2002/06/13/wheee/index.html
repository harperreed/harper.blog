    <p>Tonight was a great time. I hung out with my friend rachel. how nice. she took me for a ride on her scooter and we went to a really great electro show.. with the fierce exception of trans-am(heh) and we hung with some cool cats. Then we went to clarks.. hugn with more cool cats. heh. and then came home. it was a really great night
<br/><br/></p>

<p>as per the usual&hellip; the blue line took forever. so I have to piss the entire way. I am talking really bad. I can barely hold it. I get off the train and rachel is making fun of me for walking funny and having to pee so bad. and I was totally ready to piss in an ally.. no joking.. a need had come over my body. nothing mattered any more.. just urine.<br/>
So we get into the ally.. and I pony up to a dumpster and let er rip. I am talking a fierce piss. like somthing out of a nature film. it was crazy. and rachel is laughing and pointing and usual. and no sooner had the initial hysteria of being able to piss worn off.. then a cop rounds the ally and heads straight for us&hellip; like all good friends rachel bolts.. heh. and I however stay put. there was no way I was gunna stop peeing becuase of some cop.. and I don&rsquo;t think it would have been physically possible. it was a flood gate of sorts. no going back.. <br/>so the cop pulls up and doesn&rsquo;t say a thing. just sits there all non-chalant. he pulls up to align himself with me. and I say &ldquo;sorry officer.. it was an emergency&hellip; &rdquo; realize that the entire time.. I am pissing.. a lot.. not just a small stream. like a cannon
and the cop.. just leaves.. I continue to piss.. and then we go on our way.. <br/>oh.. and after they talked to me.. they asked rachel why she ditched me.. and she was like &ldquo;well he is goign to the bathroom&rdquo; and they left her alone.. but the black dude that was iwalking in front of us. they got out and talked to him..<br/><br/>what a night..</p>
