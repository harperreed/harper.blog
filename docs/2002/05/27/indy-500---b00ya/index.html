    <p>So this weekend was quite somthing. Friday night I went out with friends to a coupl eclubs. and hung out with &ldquo;rockstars.&rdquo; it was fun. They are all very nice. And strangly.. a high number of them are apparently computer people. it is wierd. I ended up staying out til 5 that night which was a shock to myself. I didn&rsquo;t mean to at all. heh&hellip; whoops<br/><br/>so after a late start.. my friend kayne and I headed out to indianapolis for the indy 500. he has a miata.. which is a freakin small car.. but it rides really well.. it was &ldquo;sporty.&rdquo; We showed up around 4:00 and met my father and his friends. They are funny people. My father had brought my families scooters.. so kayne and myself spent a lot of the day yesterday helling about indianapolis on the scooters. they are really fun. I suddenly understand the scooter pnks and the fun they always seem to be having. it was so cool&hellip; so anyway.. the race today was crazy. we had really good seats. and a coup[le crazy &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; occured right in front of our seats. it was insane. those cars go very vyer fast. It sucked because the winner totally &ldquo;tricked&rdquo; himself into a win. it was kinda sketchy. so so fast..</p>
