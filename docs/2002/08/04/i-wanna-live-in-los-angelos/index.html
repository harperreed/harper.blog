<p>So I just got done watching arlington road and part of edward scissorhands  on the way to California. My laptop apparently had enough battery life to support almost 2 dvds. It rules. I am happy about that.. because now I know it will last around 4 hours while watching full motion video and while spinning a dvd drive. Without the dvd drive in the machine I expect to get around 2 more hours of battery time. <br/><br/></p>

<p>While getting ready to travel to California.. I happened across an interesting quandary. I don?t own shorts. Heh. What to do. I don?t think I am ready for summer. Oh wait it is summer. Heh. Whoops. I guess I will get shorts in cali. Hmm. <br/></p>

<p>I am going to visit Compton. I can now say that I have been to Englewood. And long beach.<br/>
LBC<br/>
Ahh yea<br/>
Anyway..<br/></p>

<p>Right<br/></p>

<p>Ohh.. I got my immortality rings. .hopefully they work. I kinda forgot to bring them.
I wore them last night while sleeping and it annoyed me. I ended up taking them off.</p>

<p>The weather is very nice here in cali. It is around 75?85 degrees, A pleasant change from the violent heat of Chicago. Yesterday we arrived and got a quick tour of LA and long beach. We got a room at the queen Mary hotel. Which is HUGE. A very large boat, quite a spectacle. Apparently it is somehow related to the titanic, although I am not sure how.  We then slept in our small compartmentalized room. The next day we hung out in long beach. We took a tour at Dylan?s college. It is quite something. I kind of wish that I was in a program or had been in a program like his. It is so neat and there are so many opportunities present in his field. He is doing spectech, which is non-destructive-testing.. it seems like a cool thing. He would be doing analysis on anything and everything. For money. I really don?t know what it would be like&hellip; but it looks cool? <br/><br/></p>

<p>Then we went and drove down the coast. The ocean is so cool. It is almost shocking. It reminds me of the mystery and excitement I had when I first moved to Chicago. It makes me wonder if I should move on to another place, city or whatnot. I like Chicago.. but the coast is very nice. Although I am somewhat harmed by the suns powerful rays.. it is very pretty and incredibly mind blowing. <br/></p>

<p>I gotta go.. we are gunna walk along the beach or something ;)<br/></p>

<hr/>

<p>Today we were tourists. it was nice though. we went to silly rides at universal studios.. and we hung out at hollywood. heh. hollywood is not as cool as I thought it would be. the china-Mann??? theatre is rather nice though.. and the weather is wonderful. the weather the whole trip has been brilliant. I enjoy having the oppurtunity to be chilly. what an idea.</p>
