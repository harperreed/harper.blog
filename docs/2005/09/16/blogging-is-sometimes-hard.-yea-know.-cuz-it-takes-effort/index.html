    <p>So i don&rsquo;t usually do it. i only do it when i feel its easy - or maybe when it is hardest. i don&rsquo;t really know. i imagine you can totally tell by reading my past entries. regardless of how easy or hard it is - i totally thinkthat i need to blog sometimes. and whether or not i do is a different story. i wish i had a blogging client that made it easy to update my blog in quick places.</p>

<p>some funny things i though yesterday that i wanted to immediately blog were the thought that no matter how big or small i was - i would be able to have basically the same output as i do now. which is very interesting. i like the internet. it doesn&rsquo;t matter really who you are, look like, physical present is, or anything - you can achieve in a sense the same as someone else that has the same internet privilege.</p>

<p>my new internet friend who spotted me on the train has a blog <A href="http://www.maryheartshector.blogspot.com/">here</a>.  check it out.</p>

<p>i am currently attempting to work. and watching the <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0327920/">wilco movie</a>.  its pretty good. interesting. i don&rsquo;t really know who wilco is - i know the name jeff tweedy - but i haven&rsquo;t heard much wilco. its really amazing to hear and see the work process. i would love to be a fly on the wall for many recording sessions. its amazing. i can&rsquo;t imagine really.</p>

<p>tonight i went to X/O with my mom and her friend betty. it was of course good. but it wasn&rsquo;t as good without my dad, hiromi and matiss there to enjoy it with us. i really miss hiromi. i think i am going to visit soon. i want to. there is no reason why i wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>its raining. i am sleepy.</p>
