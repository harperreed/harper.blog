    <p>So today my parents came to visit me. How nice it is to finally have something to do. My girlfriend is away again - off to see her parents. Alas, I wish I could be with her. Today we walked around, at at shoddy resturants and went and saw one of the best movies of all time. <b>Lord Of The Rings</b>. Boy oh Boy was it ever entertaining. It was very long, but I was able to handle it - in fact everyone was able to handle it. It was the most enthraling three hour movie I have ever seen. It was simply amazing. the effects, the cinematography and all the nonsense. It ruled. Oh, and I am addicted to saying way. like that is way cool or that is way harsh. arghh it is annoying.. annoying like not gettin got see the blueman group with ALL of my loved ones.. alas&hellip;</p>
