    <p>###Preface</p>

<p>I have been following <a href="http://usesthis.com">The Setup</a> for quite awhile. I love learning about the <strong>how</strong>, <strong>why</strong> and <strong>what</strong> of getting things done. The Setup does such a great job of shifting the dialog to the objects that are behind the action.</p>

<p>So, as a long time reader, I was stoked when Daniel (aka <a href="http://waferbaby.com">waferbaby</a>) reached out and asked if I would like to do an interview.</p>

<p>Although I have included it here, please <a href="http://harper.reed.usesthis.com/">check it out</a> on <a href="http://usesthis.com">The Setup</a>.</p>

<p>#My interview for <a href="http://usesthis.com">The Setup</a></p>

<p>####Who are you, and what do you do? (Try to keep this brief!)</p>

<p>I am <a href="http://harperreed.org">Harper Reed</a>. I make things happen on the internet. I am a connector and a technologist. I like to meld both of those things together to connect people to one another and enable them to build amazing technology. In the past I spent a bunch of time helping <a href="http://threadless.com">Threadless</a> grow, then I helped <a href="http://www.sandboxindustries.com/">startups</a> in Chicago <a href="http://www.exceleratelabs.com/">grow</a>, and now I am helping <a href="http://barackobama.com">reelect the president</a>.</p>

<p>####What hardware are you using?</p>

<p>I typically have two workstations that I keep in sync via <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. In the past, I have relied on a trusty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#X_series">Lenovo X series</a> laptop running <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> that I carry with me and then a workstation at home that is some form of macbook pro/mac mini. I used this setup for many years and loved it. Recently, because I fell in love with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air#Design">Macbook Air form factor</a>, I migrated away from the lenovo and ubuntu in favor of a tiny happy <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP631">11&rdquo; Macbook Air (i7)</a>. It works well. For my desktop workstation I am using a late-model <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP632">Mac Mini (i7)</a> paired with a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ph/consumer/monitor-peripherals-printer/monitor/lcd-monitor/LS23MYZKFNA/XP/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail">Samsung SyncMaster 2343 monitor</a>. It looks great and doesn&rsquo;t take up too much space on my desk.</p>

<p>I obsess about bags. My daily driver is an <a href="https://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/laptop-bags/buran.html">black on black Chrome Buran bag</a>. It is a very good bag. It isn&rsquo;t too fancy or clever. It just works. I sometimes travel using an <a href="http://countycomm.com/minebag.html">EOD mini utility bag</a>. It fits my air, power cord and a change of clothes. Recently a friend picked up a <a href="http://defybags.com/urban-cowboy.html">Defy Urban Cowboy bag</a>. It has an amazing buckle and fits the air perfectly.  Inside of these bags, my air lives in its own <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/packandsmooch">Pack and Smooch</a> <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/62891440/11-inch-macbook-air-sleeve-hampshire-lts">Hampshire pouch</a>. It is felt and leather and was designed to not scratch up your air. Looks great too.</p>

<p>In my bag, I have a few organizational aids. I wrap up my Air power cord using the <a href="http://www.quirky.com/products/15-PowerCurl-Mac-Cord-Manager">Quirky PowerCurl</a> (I love it because it is handy and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">crowdsourced</a>). I keep a lot of miscellaneous cords, and whatnot in a <a href="http://www.service.kleintools.com/Tools/PRD/Category/Zipper%20Bag%20-%20Canvas%20TOOLBAGS-CANVASTLBG-ZIPPERCNVS/Product/5139">Klein Tools canvas utility bag</a>. It is handy to have a bag in my main bag to stuff things that will normally get lost.</p>

<p>At work I listen to a pair of <a href="http://www.aiaiai.dk/store/headphones/tma-1">AiAiAi TMA-1</a> powered by a <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/juice2214/m.html?_nkw=&amp;_armrs=1&amp;_from=&amp;_ipg=&amp;_trksid=p3686#ptm250917156510">candy tin headphone amp</a>. At home I listen to a pair of <a href="http://www.gradolabs.com/page_headphones.php?item=f4ba8830232696b5f580bd531134b668">Grado sr60i</a>. I find that the Grado  headphones are quite noisy for people around me compared to the TMA-1s. Both are fine. I carry in my bag a pair of <a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones-headphones/se-models/se115-sound-isolating-earphones">Shure SE115 earphones</a> for use when commuting or flying.</p>

<p>For a mobile comminucations, my primary device is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone_4s">iPhone 4S</a>. I use Sprint for the carrier so that I can take advantage of the <a href="http://www.google.com/googlevoice/sprint/">Sprint/Google Voice integration</a>.  This enables me to switch between my android phone (a well used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_S">Nexus S</a> on T-mobile) and my iPhone whenever I feel like it.  The iPhone is an amazing device. The camera is outstanding, the app ecosystem is great, the OS is frustrating. ;)</p>

<p>I aggressively use my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle">Kindle</a>. I am a <a href="http://harperreed.org/books">voracious reader</a> and the kindle is my constant companion on the quest to consume as many books as possible. The kindle has been a magical device for me. Besides being able to instantly start new books, I love how single purpose the kindle is. It makes it very easy to read books (as it should). I imagine that it will eventually become the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age">Young Lady&rsquo;s Illustrated Primer</a> that I want so badly. Until then, it will be my book consuming machine.</p>

<p>A quick note on Kindles: I have owned the suite of Kindle devices. The best kindle they have made is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle">Kindle 4</a> (also known as the cheap kindle). After using the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/zachklein/status/1192280043">Aztec Kindle</a>, the various Kindles with keyboards and finally the Kindle touch - I find that I am able to be a happier and more efficient reader with the cheaper kindle.</p>

<p>####And what software?</p>

<p>I try and keep a pretty simple software catalog. I don&rsquo;t want too many apps clogging my various tubes.</p>

<p>To browse the interwebs, I use <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>. I edit all sorts of documents with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">Vi</a> (I really like <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a> + <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> on OSX). I use iTunes to listen to locally stored music. I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichat">ichat</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adium">adium</a> (on OSX) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gajim">Gajim</a> (ubuntu) for messaging; for IRC, I use  <a href="http://www.scrollz.com/">Scrollz</a> (inside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen">screen</a> (thinking about migrating to <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a>) on a shell). I use whatever generic terminal is available for my shells. To make my shell experience on OSX bearable, I use <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">homebrew</a> (I shudder to think how things used to be on OSX). I use <a href="http://dropbox.com/">dropbox</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> to keep things wrapped together. I have been experimenting with keeping my data in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_image#Sparse_bundle">encrypted sparse bundles</a> stored in git/dropbox.</p>

<p>Inside the browser I use a bunch of software to get things done. I rely on <a href="http://google.com/a/">Google Apps</a> for a lot (mail, docs, collaboration, sms, voice, etc).  I use <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com">simple note</a> to keep track of random thoughts on my phone.</p>

<p>I love and use <a href="http://github.com">github</a>. I was not a git convert at first, but github made sharing code and working collaboratively better than ever. It is an amazing tool. I now use git everyday and it has made me a better developer and collaborator.</p>

<p>For some strange reason, I use both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Cloud_Drive#Cloud_Player">Amazon Cloudplayer</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Beta_by_Google">Google Music</a>. They are functionally almost exactly the same and I have similar music collections on both. I switch arbitrarily between them. I purchase most of my music from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_MP3">Amazon MP3</a>. I also listen to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio">RDIO</a> when I am lazy. I listen to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hype_Machine">hype machine</a> more often than I should.</p>

<p>One of my favorite killer apps is <a href="http://partycapp.appspot.com">partychat</a>. It is an <a href="https://code.google.com/p/partychapp/">open source</a> jabber based persistent chat room. It works with google talk and is VERY simple. I use this to communicate with small groups of friends/collaborators. It has allowed <a href="http://kntd.us">us</a> to collaborate on some amazing things.</p>

<p>####What would be your dream setup?</p>

<p>I am lucky and am pretty happy with my current setup. I would easily add faster internet, more memory, smaller devices, better battery life and more general device convergence. also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a>.</p>

<p>My dream setup from when I was in high school is more interesting. I spent hours drooling over the advertisements in the back of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Shopper_(US_magazine) planning for this very question. For the processor, I wanted a [486 DX2 66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486DX2). I needed enough RAM to run [OS/2 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2) well (not warp!). To support the advanced graphics that OS/2 demanded, I wanted a [number nine GXE 64 graphics card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Nine_Visual_Technology#Number_Nine_Video_Cards_using_S3_Graphics_Processors). I desperately wanted a [Sound Blaster AWE64 sound card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_AWE64) to play [mods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file) and [id games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software). I also needed a crazy [ZyXEL 14.4 Modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZyXEL#Products) to dial into my local telnet drops and BBSes. The eventual goal was to triple boot [Slackware Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware) (sooo many disks), OS/2 and windows 95. At some point around '94 I achieved most of this, however OS/2 had faded away as a priority and I spent most of my time in Linux (thank goodness">Computer Shopper</a>.</p>
