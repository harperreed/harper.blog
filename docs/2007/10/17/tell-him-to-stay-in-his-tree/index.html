  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>Today I found out that my dad was placed into the hospital to help him fight his infidel skin. Basically he has what is colloquially known as &ldquo;extreme eczema,&rdquo; but basically it seems that his skin is attempting to hijack his body and run it into a building. So with that in mind, he went to get himself checked out.</p>

<p>During his check out, the doctor was like &ldquo;OMG. Yours skin is at terror alert red. you need to check yourself in immediately. &rdquo; and so he did.</p>

<p>Needless to say, my mom was pretty upset by this. My parents like each other (So strange in this day and age) and they don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time apart. So my dad being away is hard. and now that he is away and in a hospital - it is a bit stressful.</p>

<p>She called and asked if I would come down with her. I wasn&rsquo;t sure because i was supposed to go to this conference. So I checked around to see if any of my other siblings were able or near. I first called Dylan - but him being the only Reed left at the family company - he had to stay and hold down the fort. Apparently there were a bunch of fires he had to but out. So i called our brother from another mother - Jon. And this is where the story gets fun.</p>

<p>I call Jon and say &ldquo;Jon, What are you up to.&rdquo; Jon in his typical fashion tells me that he is just getting down from a redwood tree and is in California, but making his way to Portland. This is hilarious. I tell him the situation and he is pretty bummed, and can make it out on Thursday. So i tell him i will get back to him.</p>

<p>I then talk to my mom and mention that Jon is in some trees and can come out if she wants. So she tells me that I should &ldquo;Tell him to stay in his tree.&rdquo; Heh.</p>

<p>Damn hippies.</p>

<p>So anyway. I will be flying out to meet my mom and help support the family units for the next few days. Hopefully I will be able to get some awesome work done and explore the Hogwarts like world that is the hospital.</p>
