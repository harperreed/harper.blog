  </div>
  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>Today I decided I was going to build the asynchronous picture uploader for one of our new projects. I had installed the <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/uploadprogress">PECL Uploadprogress extension</a> awhile ago and I just needed to build an example and then build it into our app.</p>

<p>However, my plan was spited by the opensource gods who delivered very little documentation about how to use the <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/uploadprogress">PECL Uploadprogress extension</a>. So here is my quick writeup and example.</p>

<p>After crawling for 30 minutes through the C++ source of the Uploadprogress extension, I figured out what the heck was actually happening. The basic set of events is that an upload occurs. with that upload post is a hidden input that has a unique ID in it. The Uploadprogress extension then assigns the progress of that upload to that ID. Then when you call the uploadprogress_get_info() function with that unique id, the response is the upload progress.  So, the two key pieces of information are this:</p>

<p>The function that accesses the upload progress is:
<blockquote>uploadprogress_get_info($unique_id);</blockquote>
It takes a string that is the uploads unique id. To set this id you include the following hidden input in your upload form:
<blockquote>&lt;input type=&ldquo;hidden&rdquo; name=&ldquo;UPLOAD_IDENTIFIER&rdquo; value=&rdquo;&lt;?php echo $some_uniq_id; ?&gt;&rdquo; /&gt;</blockquote>
This sets the ID of the upload that the uploadprogress extension then can track. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. As far as I could tell, if you entered a different ID name, your uploadprogress_get_info($unique_id); will not work. If there is no upload, or it is complete uploadprogress_get_info() returns not a array.</p>

<p>So the pseudo php code is like this</p>

<p><strong>upload.php</strong>
<blockquote>&lt;form crap&gt;
&lt;input type=&ldquo;hidden&rdquo; name=&ldquo;UPLOAD_IDENTIFIER&rdquo; value=&rdquo;&lt;?php echo $some_uniq_id; ?&gt;&rdquo; /&gt;
&lt;input type=&ldquo;file&rdquo; &hellip;&hellip;. /&gt;
&lt;input type=&ldquo;submit&rdquo; &hellip;. /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</blockquote>
<strong>progress.php</strong>
<blockquote>&lt;?
$uniq_id = $_GET[&ldquo;id&rdquo;];
print_r(uploadprogress_get_info($unique_id));
?&gt;</blockquote>
so you would load up upload.php and upload a huge file. Then in another browser window you would view progress.php?id=$some_uniq_id and theoretically you would get a raw progress response from uploadprogress_get_info().</p>

<p>heh.</p>

<p>So I have created a working (at least on my server) example of this for yall to test. I have placed it in my code archive under <a href="http://stuff.harperreed.org/?path=code%2Fphp_upload_progressbar">php_upload_progressbar</a>. This example uses prototype and YUI components to achieve totally asynchronous uploads and then has a CSS progress bar to handle the upload progress. The upload is through an Iframe using the YUI container.js and the updaters are using prototype. I imagine I could have used just YUI, but I know prototype better and it was easy to rock out in about thirty seconds. I have attempted to thoroughly comment both my <a href="http://stuff.harperreed.org/?path=code%2Fphp_upload_progressbar&amp;text=progress.php">progress.php</a> and my <a href="http://stuff.harperreed.org/?path=code%2Fphp_upload_progressbar&amp;text=upload.php">upload.php</a> so it should be somewhat clear on what is going on.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have questions or comments. I haven&rsquo;t placed a live example anywhere because I don&rsquo;t really feel comfortable having crazy people uploading random porn to my servers. however, I would love to help peeps that are having issues getting the example to run.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I have updated the urls - as the old ones have expired.
