    <p>For the first time in almost 7 years my servers are offline.</p>

<p>I just shut them down. It was pretty sad. They were good servers. They did a  lot of traffic. They were slashdotted, dugg, reddited, and probably any other  sited that was hot shit in the last 6 years.Â  I installed them when my dedicated  host died in early 2001. Originally I just shipped them a box, which they hooked  up. The original box was a VA Linux box from their fire sale. It owned. I paid  200 a month for unlimited transfer. At that time I was doing about 25G a day in  transfer. heh. Then in 2003, I bought a bundle of hardware to upgrade my  infrastructure and added a firewall, a super fast switch and another server.  With all this fanciness I was able to pull an average of about 120G a day&hellip; for  3 years straight. Which I think is around 130 terabytes. I guess that is what i  get for hosting shady content. ;)</p>

<p>So now I embark on a new style of hosting. A mix of hardware, shared and  virtualized.Â  I have a box at <a href="http://leaseweb.com/">leaseweb</a>, a demo  box at <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">mediatemple </a>(it is pretty dope), a  bundle of stuff at <a href="http://mosso.com/">mosso</a> and then a handful of  sites sprinkled around ec2. It makes me sad to not have full control of my  sites. I am bummed that mosso doesn&rsquo;t offer SSH. I am worried that my hosting  cocktail will not handle my needs and that I will be hit with crazy overages. I  can&rsquo;t afford a 10k hosting bill. that would be annoying.</p>

<p>When i think how this hosting plan is how most people host stuff, I can&rsquo;t  imagine their pain. Through managing my own boxes, I learned SO much. I fought  hackers (both brazillian and korean). I fought lawsuits. I fought clients and  users. I learned how to manage load, how to scale php, how to work out kinks in  a cheap infrastructure and all the fun tricks that got me to my job at  threadless. But most of all I learned that I really love linux and open source  software.</p>

<p>I will miss you servers! Peaces!</p>
