  </div>
  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>I am a blog advocate. I am often pushing my friends to get blogs and to update them. I love reading about how my friends are doing and what is going on in their lives and with their friends. It is such a nifty way to stay in touch. I know from my own experience how rewarding blogging can be. How it can create connections with people who normally would never be connected. I love it. So with that said - I am constantly helping friends set up blogs. And now I have it down to a science. I have figured out how to use wordpress and a couple plugins to create the perfect blogging environment for n00b bloggers. here is how it goes:</p>

<p>So the first step is a domain. I always suggest to my friends that they get a domain. I, of course, always offer a subdomain of penisfighter.com - but they usually take the domain route. I suggest using <a href="http://joker.com">joker.com</a> because of their DNS and web interface being pretty solid; but I have had good experience with pretty much everyone. The one trick for registrars that don&rsquo;t have their own DNS is to use the free DNS over at <a href="http://www.everydns.net/">everydns.net</a>. Its a pain in the ass to set up, but works really well. Quite a few of my friends use it for their sites and like all server based services, they only complain when it is down (which is luckily not very often).</p>

<p>So you go to <a href="http://joker.com">joker.com</a> and you register joeblow.com. Then you are stuck with a domain and no place to put it. So you have to get hosting. Well this isn&rsquo;t to hard - if you are friends with a nerd who has a server, then ask them. Otherwise you will have to settle for something like <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?159982">dreamhost</a> or if you are insane, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22mediatemple+sucks%22">mediatemple</a>. I tend to stay away from the bigger guys. they seem to fuck people over well. although I have friends who have hosted with <a href="http://godaddy.com">godaddy</a> with great happiness.</p>

<p>So then you have hosting and you need to do something with your domain. This is where I really have the formula down pat.</p>

<p>So the first thing I do is go to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">wordpress and download</a> the latest version. It is really easy to remember that the tar is always located at: <a href="http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz">http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz</a>. I download it using wget, and the extract it into the web dir. I usually then move all the wordpress files into the root - but whatever you want to do is fine. I then setup wordpress so that it is at a point where it works. You can get <a href="http://weblogs.about.com/cs/tutorials/ht/wordpress.htm">more info about setting up wordpress here</a>.</p>

<p>Once its set up and working I go in and do the following:
<ol>
    <li>Create another user to be the main blog author - I do this so that their is an admin user that can control and modify everything and then the main blog author can&rsquo;t fuck up the blog.</li>
    <li>I change the permalink structure to be name based - I do this so that Google and other search engines can find your blog easier.</li>
    <li>I enable the askismet spam plugin - This made blogging fun again. USE IT.</li>
</ol>
Then after the initial tweaks are set up I move on to the trickier part (and by tricky I don&rsquo;t mean hard, I just ran out of words).</p>

<p>So most of the people who I host wordpress blogs for are really interesting in showing photos and what not besides their well crafted prose. I used to think that having all my photos on my personal server was an awesome way to go about it, but then I discovered flickr and would never go back. So I MAKE everyone go <a href="http://www.flickr.com/signup/">get a flickr account</a> and then install the <a href="http://www.randombyte.net/blog/projects/falbum/">Falbum plugin</a> so that it appears that their photos are on their site and not flickrs. It is one of the better wordpress plugins out there. I have been using it for a minute and really like how easy it is to use/configure and maintain. All you have to do is authorize it and then go to the options and tweak how you want it to look. I make sure that the URL scheme is using friendly URLs, so that the photo album is easy to find and easy to link to.</p>

<p>Once that is done I used to tell people to go to the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes/Theme_List">theme list on wordpress.org</a> - but that got annoying. Like all &ldquo;clients,&rdquo; friends who are getting blogs are never able to make up their minds and totally unprepared for choosing one theme among hundreds. So now, I just download the <a href="http://blogtheinternet.com/2006/09/04/wp-widgets-ready-theme-pack-download/3/">widget friendly wordpress theme pack</a>. heh. Then I just install all 100 or so themes. This way - there is no limit to the design potential of the new blog. And they will all be ready and able with widgets. I figure that hosting 50M of themes is the compromise I am willing to take for not hosting pictures and media. heh. Then I download and enable the <a href="http://automattic.com/code/widgets/">widget plugin</a> so that the future blogger can customize the theme a bit. And I am about done.</p>

<p>What the fancy new blogger ends up with is a really awesome fully customizable blog that is able to have pictures, entries and all that. It has the ability to look different than a lot of blogs out there and is running good software and is easy to use. And to make it even easier - if the potential power blogger is on windows, I suggest they use <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/">windows live writer</a>. That program makes blogging so easy. I love it.</p>

<p>So then I have a new friend with a new blog. I then add the feed to my <a href="http://blogs.nata2.org">friends blog list</a> and then push then out the door, out into the wild world of blogging.</p>
