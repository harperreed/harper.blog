  </div>
  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>So I am in the market for a new laptop. I am currently using a <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.aspx?i=2296">Dell Inspiron 700M</a> which I purchased a couple summers ago when I was doing freelance work. It has been a really good laptop and has gotten a lot of stuff done. So now that the customary 2 years has past, I am feeling the itch to upgrade to faster, cooler and much better machine.</p>

<p>My laptop is my primary computer. I used to use a desktop as my primary computer - but those days have past. Anymore, I can&rsquo;t deal with having one location for my computing. I need to be able do work anywhere. I really have no idea what the future brings. I am always suddenly traveling. From going to random places for skinnyCorp to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/natatwo/sets/72157594444547976/">visiting new relatives in japan</a>. Nobody knows what&rsquo;s going to happen in 2 months! I may go to Guam to meet with a guamish collocation facility to host our new guamish extratasty site.</p>

<p>In regards to my laptop use, I primarily use windows apps that connect me to Linux boxes where I do all my work. My desktop IDE is <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and my default text editor is <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a>. I spend most of my computing time in <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">firefox</a> and in <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">putty</a>. I rarely use photoshop. So for the most part, I am OS agnostic. I think I could get away with a <a href="http://penguinpetes.com/b2evo/index.php?p=264&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">Linux desktop</a>, or a OSX desktop. I would like the ability to boot windows occasionally, but I have no need for it to be my primary OS. In fact, regardless of what I choose - I am going to be attempting to use <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">ubuntu</a> as the default OS (at least for a minute).</p>

<p>So here is my quandary.  Do I get a <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&amp;current-category-id=19C791A03AF24034A0011B825513BCED">Lenovo/IBM T60</a> or a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">black macbook</a>?</p>

<p>I have been in LOVE with the IBM laptops since I used one back at CK. They are obviously the best workstation laptops. I am a bit scared since Lenovo took over the manufacturing of them, but what I have seen and heard from my friends tells me I shouldn&rsquo;t be worried. I like how they look, I like the features they support and I like how easy they are for hardware compatibility. I don&rsquo;t really like the price - but what can you do.</p>

<p>however&hellip;</p>

<p>I also LOVE the black macbook. I currently have a pre-intel macmini and I really enjoy it. I love that it has native Unix capabilities and I really love the productivity options that are in OSX. I constantly sync my phone with iSync. In fact that is the only reason I have a macmini now. I think that OSX is a very good development environment and I think I am ready for a change such as that. I am really scared about not having two mouse buttons.</p>

<p>So it seems that with either laptop, I am going to be able to support 90% if not 99% of the software I use on a regular basis. So software support isn&rsquo;t that big of an issue. I guess what is an issue is which will be the better laptop. Which will be the longer lasting and which is ultimately more powerful.</p>

<p>Both laptops are about the same price as I would configure them.</p>

<p>While I was at the mysql conf, I started looking around at various laptops that people used. It seemed that everyone used either an IBM or a Apple, with a few Dells and randoms sprinkled in for good measure. So it seems that both are popular among opensource and engineers.</p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts.. I am open to anything - even (maybe) going with another brand.
