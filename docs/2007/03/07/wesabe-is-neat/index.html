    <p><p><a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natatwo/413749725/"><img height="240" alt="Wesabe Goals" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/413749725_0bc3177e8f_m.jpg" width="163" align="right"></a>I started this post awhile ago. But with my brothers <a href="http://www.dylanreed.org/2007/03/06/i-hate-credit-card-companies/">angry credit card company post</a> and my <a href="http://www.nata2.org/2007/03/06/goddamn-i-hate-iowa-student-loan-people/">angry student loan post</a>, I think a post about how to easily manage ones finances is more topical than ever. So anyway&hellip; My official&nbsp; attempt to better manage my finances all started about 6 months ago when Hiromi and I first got married. With her away for most of that time - I was able to get things in a more working order than they were before. So then when she arrived she wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with the spidery cobwebbed world that was my banking. So I kinda got things in a reasonable state and I decided to start using quicken again. But like everytime I use quicken - it wasn&rsquo;t interesting enough to keep up with. So I started looking for alternatives. </p> <p>I found <a href="http://www.wesabe.com/">Wesabe</a>.</p> <p>I first read about Wesabe on some blog about startups. It mentioned that it was a way to use a community to get hints and help in managing your finances. Well, using a community to view my money seemed a bit weird. But like any weirdo web 2.0 nerd I decided to jump in and check it out. So I signed up. I uploaded some account data (after reading their <a href="http://www.wesabe.com/page/security">security statement</a> - nice). I was immediately in the world of viewing my finances in an interesting way. Fun. </p> <p>Wesabe basically takes your financial data and make it easy to see what&rsquo;s going down in your world. It then uses tags, names and other aggregate data to find hints and tips from the community that may help you. It&nbsp;is also able&nbsp;to provide graphs and interesting views of your finances. You can tag and note transactions. You can give things real names and really get a feeling for where your money is going.&nbsp; All this makes&nbsp;Wesabe a sort of flickr for money. It is awesome. </p> <p>So I then attempted successfully to use the <a href="https://www.wesabe.com/accounts/upload">uploader</a> and was able to upload all of my accounts to Wesabe and BAM. suddenly the power of it clicked. I am able to see trends. I can set goals and then assign certain tags to that goal to see what kind of spending I am doing and visualize what my personal financial trends are. In a way that isn&rsquo;t hard to understand. its pretty neat. And the tips from the other users are fun. </p> <p>So if you are like me and quicken isn&rsquo;t your thing, but you want a neat way to check out your finances. I would certainly look into using Wesabe. It owns. </p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:e64ed81a-c81f-4105-b427-a32a6c41858d" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">[tags]wesabe, savings, money, budget, finances[/tags]</div></p>
