  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>This weekend my parents visited. It was really awesome. They haven&rsquo;t visited since Hiromi moved back - and they really wanted to see her. So they stopped by for a quick trip and some excellent dining.</p>

<p>They got in Thursday night - so Hiromi and myself went downtown and visited them at the Hard Rock Hotel and had a nice quick drink. They stayed on the same floor (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa">Frank Zappa</a> floor) and the exact same room as Hiromi and I - when we last stayed in the Hard Rock. heh. Weird.</p>

<p>So the excitement started on Friday. My parents came and met Hiromi for lunch. I wasn&rsquo;t able to accompany because I was at <a href="http://www.fogodechao.com/">Fogo De Chao</a> with the skinnyCorp eating an awesome spring Fogo lunch. Hiromi and my parents ended up going to <a href="http://www.smokinwoodys.com/">Smokin Woody&rsquo;s</a> and then hanging out at the <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-25,GGGL:en&amp;q=red+eye+cafe&amp;near=Chicago,+IL&amp;radius=0.0&amp;latlng=41850000,-87650000,3524402088938722178&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local&amp;ct=authority">Red Eye cafe</a> that is next door to my place. They then walked down to skinnyCorp and hung out in Charlie&rsquo;s booth and rocked out a bit. We ere able to snag a quick reservation for Green Zebra to start off our eating just right.</p>

<p>For those of you who have never been to <a href="http://www.greenzebrachicago.com/">Green Zebra</a> - you should stop what you are doing and make a reservation right now. It is amazing. Totally awesome vegetarian friendly food. They have such a great menu and the atmosphere is really nice. I love it. My parents also loved it. Even Tag -who hates vegetarian food thought it was amazing. We spent a long time just hanging out and talking. The only downside is that green zebra was more than my parents airfare out to Chicago. hah.</p>

<p>After having such a nice dinner - Hiromi, Tag and myself went to <a href="http://sonotheque.net">sonotheque</a> and had a couple too many drinks. heh. Then home.</p>

<p>Then on Saturday - we walked around and got hiromi a nice coat, ate at the South Water Kitchen. The <a href="http://www.southwaterkitchen.com/">South Water Kitchen</a> is located right by the Hard Rock and we had a really nice brunch/lunch. The service was amazing and the food was simple. Afterwards we chilled out a bit and did some shopping and eventually made our way up to Clark and Foster to meet up with <a href="http://therats.org">Matiss</a> and Erica at LaDonna for dinner.</p>

<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&amp;hl=en&amp;q=ladonna&amp;near=chicago&amp;layer=&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=10&amp;ll=42.223433,-87.606354&amp;spn=0.386446,0.902252&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=A&amp;iwd=1&amp;cid=41975552,-87668353,2873420247510877837">LaDonna</a> has a amazing selection of pastas and accompanying sauces. You choose a pasta and a sauce and hope for the best - which is really pretty easy. I had lobster ravioli with a tomato cream sauce. So good. Everyone seemed really happy about their dinner choices and we had a good time - even though the service was really bad. It was really nice to have dinner with Matiss and Erica - and nice that my parents were finally able to meet Erica.</p>

<p>We then all went home. Hiromi and I have been getting more and more sick and Saturday night was the peak of our sickness. We came home and watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0450259/">Blood Diamond</a>. It was quite good. Really sad. Hiromi was sad to have a diamond ring after she watched it. What is interesting is how you cannot tell if your Diamond is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_diamonds">conflict</a> free. You just have to not have diamonds. Stupid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers">De Beers</a> and their monopoly. It is worth watching.</p>

<p>So Sunday came and Hiromi and I in our Nyquil induced slumber accidentally slept late. We finally met my parents about 1pm for lunch. We went to <a href="http://www.smithandwollensky.com/chicago.htm">Smith and Wollensky&rsquo;s</a>, where we had an excellent steak lunch. It was not as light as our previous meals and was quite nice. I had a pepper encrusted filet and my father had the filet Oscar. Both quite good. My mom had amazing truffle mac and cheese and Hiromi had a really nicely prepared fish. It was awesome.</p>

<p>After lunch we went to Macy&rsquo;s to check out <a href="http://usa.lush.com/cgi-bin/lushdb/index.html?lang=en_US&amp;dlang=en">Lush</a> and to get some medicine at <a href="http://www.merz.com/">Merz</a>. I have been a bit under the weather for the past couple weeks and Hiromi has been taking great care of me. She has picked up a number of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hippie+medicine">homeopathic</a> medicines and I really like it. I have taken to calling it hiromiopathic - because she takes such good care. So now that she is sick I need to step up and take the best care too.</p>

<p>After our quick little shopping excursion - we went to the worst movie I have ever seen. It was called <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/astronaut_farmer/">Astronaut Farmer</a>. Hands down the most cliche insane movie ever. It was so bad. I wished I could have fallen asleep. But we enjoyed the horror that it was.</p>

<p>To pay our selves back for witnessing such a horrible monstrosity that was Astronaut Farmer - we went to AVEC for dinner. <a href="http://www.avecrestaurant.com/">Avec</a> is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I love it. it has such a good atmosphere and the staff is always very nice and accommodating. And the food is amazing. We had some really great cheese and of course awesome olives. I had a really nice proscuitto and a really awesome parsnip dish. The dessert was an incredible grapefruit sorbet - it really topped off an amazing meal. So tasty.</p>

<p>So that brings us to now. It has been an amazing time. I am really glad that my parents were able to make it. The only thing that would have made it better is if <a href="http://dylanreed.org">Dylan</a> and <a href="http://photodork.org">Sarah</a> were here as well. But that will have to wait until another time.</p>
