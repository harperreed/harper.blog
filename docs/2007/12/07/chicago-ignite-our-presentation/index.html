  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>Tonight, Scott and I presented at the Chicago Ignite tech meetup. It was pretty fun. The event was &ldquo;eventful&rdquo; and the people were the usual. I was able to meet up with trow and the hosted labs guys - so that was good. It is always fun to involve ourselves in these affinity events. This one was especially funny because it was at a good friends bar. So when we showed up - it was quite hilarious.</p>

<p>We were scheduled to present on smart choices in small IT. However, that didn&rsquo;t really go as we had planned. We got as far as creating an initial presentation of the small IT ideas - but we didn&rsquo;t feel right presenting something so dry at the end of this event. We thought that most of the people are gunna be a bit intoxicated and probably won&rsquo;t care that skinnycorp uses google apps. (If you think you might care - i suggest you check out <a href="http://www.morefishthanman.com/2007/12/03/the-5-smartest-things-you-can-do-in-small-it-right-now/">Scott&rsquo;s blog on the subject</a> - it is a culmination of our talks and the basic outline for our planned presentation. ) So with this in mind, we gave up on doing a serious presentation and decided to just rock out in our typical guerrilla humor way.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.google.com/TeamPresent?docid=dd3wvxq5_43gq3g4x">So here is our presentation</a>. I suggest that you check it out. I am so happy we didn&rsquo;t do the serious presentation. When we finally went on, the crowd needed something more fun than the general dry tech pitch that so many people where going.</p>
