    <p>I sit on IRC quite a lot. Most of the time in #corporate on efnet. I have been there pretty much everyday for the last 5 years. Kind of insane. I love shells. anyway, in the past couple months some friends and i were talking about starting another channel. So we brainstormed some channel names. Then i squatted in a couple of them to see what kind of people came in. We didn&rsquo;t want something that people were regularly joining or using. We wanted something fresh but easy to remember.</p>

<p>Tonight i was sitting here, minding my own business when someone comes into #hot (a horrible name, but one we talking about) and just starts talking away. The funny thing is that there is nobody but me and a bot in the channel. And we have similar nicks - so if you were on IRC for more than a couple minutes you would realize that at least one of us is not real. So this guy jumps into the channel and says:
<blockquote>23:30|starbosa (~hh@166.240.221.203.dial.dynamic.acc09-kent-syd.comindico.com.au) has joined channel #hot
23:31|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; you must be encridibley thick, i&rsquo;m the dominant one here
23:31|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; be yourself, be ziad, stop copying other people
23:31|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; i&rsquo;m seeing other people right now
23:31|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; i&rsquo;m beeing myself
23:32|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; that&rsquo;s why you copy people, you&rsquo;re not creative
23:33|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; you&rsquo;re being too emotional, so i&rsquo;m going to change the subjet, it&rsquo;s irrelvent
23:34|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; a real man is creative, he knwos himself
23:39|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; a real man is creative, he  doesnt copy others
23:41|starbosa has left channel #hot
23:41|starbosa (~hh@166.240.221.203.dial.dynamic.acc09-kent-syd.comindico.com.au) has joined channel #hot
23:43|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; ziad i said be yourself
23:43|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; i&rsquo;m seeing other people, thats why u copy cause you&rsquo;re not creative
23:44|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; you are prone to copy, cause u&rsquo;re not creative
23:47|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; that doesnt make u a man
23:49|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; you copy cause you&rsquo;re not an arab like, so thats not who u really are, you can barely speak arabic
23:56|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; you&rsquo;re in a state of turmoil, how can you be taken seriously
00:09|&lt;starbosa:#hot&gt; ziad can&rsquo;t overwhelm a fly, it&rsquo;s just that you&rsquo;re not being yourself
01:06|Signoff: starbosa (Read error: Operation timed out)</blockquote>
Heh. No idea whats going on. But it was very entertaining. I feel like he was breaking up with my bot. maybe my bots real name is zaid. I do know that my bot is terrible at arabic. So that is probably it.</p>
