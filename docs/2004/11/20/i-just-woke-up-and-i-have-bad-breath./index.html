    <p>work is awesome again. on friday I did a bunch of stuff getting acclimated with flash and such. kinda fun. then I got bored and wne to drop off some cds to my &ldquo;boss.&rdquo; he was in his office with this dude listening to music. they were listening to death from above 1979. so I hung out and we all talked about death metal for about 40 minutes. totally awesome. I love it. <br/><br/>then me and some friends went to hard rock hotel. then we went to old timers. then rainbo. then empty bottle. then I was tired and drunk. so I went home. heh. and passed out until 3am at which time I packed for colorado. then I flew to colorado. then I was tired again. hah. so I took a nap. went to lunch with the fam. then took a nap again. now I have slept all day. and am starting to feel normal. <br/><br/>it is snowing here and is quite pretty. <Br><br/>some very interesting things are happening in my life. totally changing everything. <br/><br/>i just heard a cat meowing so I opened the closet and let my parents car out. hah. silly kitty. during my first nap I had a really weird dream about a cat who was hurt. and as the dream progressed. the cat got more and more human like. until in the end it was a human cat hybrid. and totally hot. hahaha. <br/><br/>my free ipod order was submitted and passed verification. now they are processing it. hopefully I get it. I have passed all of the steps so far. maybe I will get a silver ipod in a couple days. then. if that works. I am going to try and get the free plasma screen tv. hhaha. ok. the cat is on my lap. not letting me type. I will go now. ready. cat typing:</p>
