    <p>so basically I haven&rsquo;t updated this thing in about 3 years. which is a long time. so I am going to &ldquo;update&rdquo; yall as to my whereabouts. <br/><br/>so. I got this new job. it is taking a lot of my time. it rules. but I am in a different paradigm than I was when I was at the WB. basically I am totally engaged for 8 hours. I have to be much more accountable and I have to really justify my actions. this is good for me. it is a situation which allows me to grow. and if things work out how they &ldquo;should&rdquo; then I will be sitting pretty. maybe I will win. my goal is to be in a place that gives me the freedom to do what I would normally do (just fuck around all day) but in a corporate environment which I get rewarded in. I think this may be it. I am pretty excited. or I will get fired for looking at porn as usual. <br/><br/>so I am pretty disappointed in the election results. but I feel that we got our just deserve. the american people have spoken. and we now get to live with the results. so I guess now we need to just make sure we don&rsquo;t blow everyone up. I am doubtful things will get a lot better. I just hope it stays entertaining. and it will. I know it. <br/><br/>i haxored my tivo something fierce. I am currently downloading the election night daily show to burn to a cd and give to matiss. then he can watch it. awesome. I rule. <br/><br/>i want to be fancier. soon. I think my new goal is to make my apartment a cyborg apartment. with robots. I wanna get rid of all the crap I got on ebay. and make the place fancy. like with some interesting computer integrated experiments. I think it will rule. speaking of that. I need to send invoices. or I am going to be making a computer aided sad face when I lose all my moneys. <br/>
stupid stupid moneys. <br/><br/>stupid monkeys. <br/><br/>so this weekend was awesome. I went to nyc to hang out. I got <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc">pictures</a> to prove it. I hung out a bunch with my friend <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2231.jpg">natasha</a>. she is awesome and really fun. it ruled. I also was able to see some of my <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2234.jpg">friends</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2281.jpg">from afar</a>. I also met some <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2229.jpg">awesome</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2270.jpg">new</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2372.jpg">peoples</a>. I had three costomes. the first was a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2255.jpg">magic man</a> - although I told everyone I was nelson mandela, the second I don&rsquo;t have any pictures of - but I was also a magic man (this time red), the third and the best I was a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2420.jpg">playboy</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2422.jpg">bunny</a>. here is tommie as a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2429.jpg">girl</a>. and of course -
<a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2439.jpg">felix and amjad</a>. felix is playing on friday. it will be dope. I was also able to see <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A10%3A31_halloween_nyc&img=IMG_2393.jpg">Jimmy and Gretchen</a>. it ruled. I love them. gretchen hangs out with my friend justin some. it rules.
<br/><br/>the pixies are coming soon. I think natasha is gunna come out and see them with me. I am excited. tomorrow is the beastie boys. then on tuesday - lamb of god and fear factory, then on sat - pixies. then monday pixies. then after that: isis and the cradle of filth. METAL!!!!</p>
