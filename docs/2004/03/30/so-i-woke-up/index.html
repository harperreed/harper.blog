    <p>and freaked out a bit. I finally calmed down and found out that it will all be ok. I wasn&rsquo;t freaking out about anything in particular. just freaking out. more of a nervous situation than anything. it was pretty weird. it is funny when you create scenerios in your head and they matter SOOO much - yet 15 minutes later you are like.. &ldquo;ehh whatever.&rdquo; basically I woke up, went home, saw that my servers where blowing up. freaked out. freaked out about other stuff. fixed my servers. took a shower. thought about my freaking out all the way to work. drank pop. had a meeting where I became in charge. suddenly it seemed so insignificant.<br/><br/>i must be tired<br/><br/>i obviously need to go to sleep early tonight. I tihnk that will be a good plan.  I am pretty excited about sleeping. hah. I might even attempt ot leave work a bit early and get a head start on a nap. I haven&rsquo;t been napping as I should. whatever. I just need to remember to take care of myself. whatever. taking care of yourself is totally overrated.<br/><br/>i finally rebuilt my ipod after destroying it. it suddenly wasn&rsquo;t able to figure out what songs were already on the ipod and what songs were not on the ipod. it was super annoying. so all yesterday I only had 2g of mp3s(the travesty). so I rebuilt it and filled it up with all of my favorites. all 7152 of my favorite songs. wtf. ipods are insane. I guess I need a bigger one. haha. it is also pretty insane to think that I have purchased 366 songs from the itunes store. I may have a problem. when this first came out I was like &ldquo;awesome, no more money spent at virgin.&rdquo; however. I was totally tricked. but yea. my library consists 9559 songs. I am so close to 10000. that is pretty cool. what else is crazy is that I own probably 95% of the songs. that extra 500 songs which I don&rsquo;t own are either risdual from the napstar days - or are friends bands.<br/><br/>i am nodding off. so sleepy. <br/><br/>last night I hung out with morgan and her aunt. it was pretty cool. we ate at harry cary&rsquo;s and then went to the signature lounge. hah. it was pretty funny. both of those places are places I only go with people from out of town. morgan&rsquo;s aunt works for <a href="http://www.alientechnology.com/">Alien technology</a>. they make RFID stuff. it is pretty fun stuff it seems. I relaly want to learn more so I can screw with the eycards and become soemone else. I once was able to change the resistance of the card or whaver by slicing a small chunk of it off. the door  guy was all &ldquo;wtf this isn&rsquo;t you.&rdquo; and I looked. it wasn&rsquo;t me at all. which leads me to believe that you can manipulate those cards with knives and scissors. <br/><br/>i am cold<br/>i am goign to finish eating my meal I purchased almost 2 hours ago. it is sooo fresh and so clean. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.williamhung.net">this is funny</a>, but you probably already saw it. if you have - you shoudl check out the songs in the itunes library. rather humorous.<br/><br/>i made really good headway on my server/firewall today. I am happy.</p>
