    <p>today everything I am wearing is either grey or black. even my underwear and socks. it is kinds funny. I didn&rsquo;t mrean to and I didn&rsquo;t really think about it until I was on the train. but yea. everything is grey. hah. <br/><br/>it is still sad out today.  the weather is nice though. the sun. however it is cold. it is kinda how I feel right now.  <br/><br/>last night morgan sent me an email that really made me feel better. of course I didn&rsquo;t get it until this morning - cuz I broke email again. haha. but I fixed it. but yea. it is funny how little words can make or break so much. <br/><br/>i am currently really into listening to &ldquo;explosions in the sky.&rdquo; very good. exactly what I need. anything with vocals has the potential of invoking emotions which I don&rsquo;t really want to share with my work environment. <br/><br/>i really didn&rsquo;t want to get up today. I enjoyed my super weird dreams and soft blankets. <br/><br/>i think that today my goal is to try and buy a damned bike. I have attempted with failure for the last 2 days. hah. stupid christians and their &ldquo;holidays.&rdquo; we all know it is a ploy to sell chocalate and jesus. <br/><bR>one of the things that is interesting about the last couple days. first off - nothing really went how I wanted it. since about wednesday. it all broke. haha. but starting yesterday - they started to patch themselves up. everything. it is like there was a flaw in the world of harper karma - and now it is coming back. sometimes when bad stuff happens it really makes you remember how lucky you are. overall. yea yea yea. <b>;)</b></p>
