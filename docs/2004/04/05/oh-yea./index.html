    <p>This weekend was good. on friday there was a blond redhead show. I was initially a bit scared that they woudn&rsquo;t represent their recorded music well - but I was wrong. they did a great job. as soon as the women started singing, it was apparent that her talent wasn&rsquo;t based on some studio tricks. after the concert I went and hung out a bit with morgn and alan. then sleep. oh precious precious sleep. then. I woke up. I woke up freaked out. haha. it didn&rsquo;t rule. however I figured it out. and BAM was better. <br/><br/>i then went to a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28148%29.jpg">dope version fest</a> meeting and hung out with all those fellows. <br/><br/>then I went home and immediately went to the BFA show. it was pretty good. a FUCK load of art. seriously a bunch of art. possibly too much. a friend of morgans <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28151%29.jpg">was in a portrait</a>. it was funny. we then went to chicago diner where I had a bunch of food very quickly. then I broke. hah. I then took food to morgan - who is sickish. hopefully she will be better soon. and then we went to a party. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28158%29.jpg">hiromi</a> , <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28176%29.jpg">alan</a> and a blurry <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28160%29.jpg">morgan</a> were all present - and  an assload of morgans friends - who I entertained with yoyo tricks as soon as the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F040420040229&amp;img=Nokia6600%28178%29.jpg">police left</a> ;) you have no idea how illegal unsanctioned yoyo tricks are.
<br/><br/>this is a horrible entry. <br/><br/><a href="http://nata2.info/misc/Incoming/Message%20from%2004_04_04.mp3">listen to this</a>. it is my friend amjad. he is pretty funny. <br/><br/>today I am going to code ALL day<br/>
and finish my taxes. <br/><br/>i just purchased a bunch of crazy hip hop to accompany me tonight. it shoudl rule.</p>
