    <p>it has been a weird couple days. It all started last wednesday. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A16_Tommie_Rockroom&img=IMG_1519.jpg">tommie</a> called me to alert me of his presence and invite me to scissor sisters. that ruled. we hung out then. and then we went to crobar and I broke myself. <br/><br/>i hadn&rsquo;t been feeling good. so I stayed in bed friday. then went to my final interview around 5ish on friday. I receieved and accepted my offer and happily went to the paper magazine party at marshall fields. we had a lot to drink and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28554%29.jpg">played fashion</a> or whatever you <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28556%29.jpg">play at events</a> like that and decided that since the night was early - we needed some entertainment that was more resturant like. so of course we went to <a href="http://www.tradervics.com/">trader vics</a>. it was insane. <br/><br/>i want to be able to say. &ldquo;it was retarded&rdquo; - blackeyed peas style. but I don&rsquo;t feel that is appropriate. but as anyone who knows me realizes - I am unable to come up with new words on the fly. so I have to think about it. and right now I am thinking about a new word to replace retarded. currently it is insane. but that isn&rsquo;t really working in the right way. <br/><br/>so anyway. trader vics was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28560%29.jpg">retarded</a>. and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F200920040149&img=Nokia6600%28568%29.jpg">totally a mess</a>. we drank $200 worth of rum drinks and decided to go to the southside to represent up on some art kids. it didn&rsquo;t work so we left and went to sound bar to see perry farrell dj. hah. apparently he is a bad dj. I have no idea. I didn&rsquo;t really hear him. <br/><br/>i met some girl named tracy. hah. we hung out a bit. weird.<br/><br/>i found a disposable camera at sound bar and will be posting pictures from it soon. I am excited to see how they turned out. the night was such a mess that it should be at least a bit entertaining. after soundbar I went to spy bar with tracy.. and then they left and I went back to sound bar. then to jays(?) and then to jordans house. then to home. then to sleep. <br/><br/>i woke up saturday dieing of the poisoning I had ingested the nigth before. I need to not do that. stupid free drinks. <br/><br/>so saturday I met my friend <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A18_Kill_hannah_afterparty&img=IMG_1556.jpg">danielle</a> and went to the <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A18_Kill_hannah_afterparty&img=IMG_1561.jpg">kill hannah</a> show. it ruled of course. <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A09%3A18_Kill_hannah_afterparty">a lot of crazines</a>. then I went home. hah. <br/><bR>sunday I went and saw <a href="http://www.gofishpictures.com/GITS2/">ghost in the shell 2</a> with elaine. that is a dope movie. I quite enjoyed it. so good. so fitting with what I am interested in right now. <br/><br/>
speaking of the darkness that has consumed me for the past couple weeks. I have ran out of things to read. so I made a run to amazon.com and purchased some stuff. I picked up:
<blockquote><small>
Restraint of Beasts: The by Mills, Magnus<br/>
Underground and Vintage Murakami by MURAKAMI, HARUKI<bR>
In a Glass Darkly  By: Sheridan Le Fanu<bR>
The Woman in the Dunes  by ABE, KOBO <bR>
Amrita, Asleep, and Kitchen  by Yoshimoto, Banana <br/>
Haruki Murakami and the Music of Words by Rubin, Jay <br/>
A Personal Matter  by Kenzaburo O?<br/>
</small></blockquote>
I am excited. I apparently forgot to by earthquake - by murakami - which is sad. but whatever. I will get it later. I love him. I am currently struggling through <a href="http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/japannew/yumiri1.htm">gold rush</a> by Yu Miri. I don&rsquo;t really like it. and it totally makes me upset. so I don&rsquo;t think I can read it any longer. I stopped carrying it. it just seems to be filled with horrible gratuitous violence. so annoying. not even a redeeming story. I need more darkness. <br/><br/>i started/made/whatever another site. relaly it is just following through with the plan I made a billion years ago. check out <a href="http://www.fukung.net">fukung.net</a>. it is my new hong kong/horror/foriegn/action/cultish movie review site. and since I started playign with that I also decided to catalog my movies for reals. I got out my fancy <a href="http://cuecatastrophe.com/">cuecat</a> barcode scanner - got some <a href="http://collectorz.com/movie/">software</a> that would do all the dirty work for me. and went to town. it took a couple hours. but the results are pretty good. check out my collection <a href="http://dopeman.org/movies/">here</a>. all 230 movies or whatever. it is amazing to look at them in that perspective. totally crazy. but whatever. <br/><br/>i am tired. weird. I have tried not to go out. and I have been pretty successful. last night I avoided it - but missed a friends bday. sad. I shoudl have gone - but was so tired. and am trying to save money. speaking of saving money I got a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fnokia_6600%2F220920041236&img=Nokia6600%28582%29.jpg">new wallet</a>. hahaha. <br/><br/>i found out today that a lot of people from work read my blog. awesome. hi peoples.</p>
