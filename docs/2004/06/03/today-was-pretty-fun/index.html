    <p>i just got home from work and hung out. chilled with rachel. got quiznos - which is near my house(weird. it just appeared). yea know the usual.

so after I hung out with rachel - I took a nap. I had meant to goto starsky and hutch - which is playing at the logan - but I accidently slept until 9:30. doh. so I walked to lula and got salmon. mmm <3 salmon. <br/><br/>check out this hilarious conversation I had today with some random person. haha.</p>

<p>HOW MY LIFE RULES. haha. I was like. wtf. then it was very funny. I don&rsquo;t really know how to react to that. other than laugh. I sent it to all my friends. haha. morgan was like &ldquo;TELL HIM I MOVED OR DIED.&rdquo; hehe. rule. <br/><br/>hiromi works now. as does matt and matiss. so once again I have from 6 until around 10 to hang out with myself. which is awesome. I get SOOOO bored. heh. so I usually sleep. now I remember how I started taking naps. I guess I need to gather some friends - even though I apparently have some - I can&rsquo;t seem to find any from 6-9. <br/><br/>ok I guess I should goto bed. work is sucking lately. it was awesome. then suckage. stupid people who are not in aggrement with me. haha. well  whatever. I will fight the &ldquo;good&rdquo; battle and probably lose. but its cool. <br/><br/>i will post a surprise later tomorrow night. it will rule. you will smile.</p>
