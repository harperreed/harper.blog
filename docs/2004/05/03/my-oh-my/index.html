    <p>tonight was good. I hung out with morgan a bunch. it was pretty weird. honestly. very strange. but it was also great. it is pretty strange - cuz we didn&rsquo;t break up with an absolute reason. it just didn&rsquo;t work out. so. are feelings are pretty much intact. just 3.5 weeks detatched. so yea. it was relaly great to see her and hang out. she hasn&rsquo;t changed in the couple weeks. no missing arms. haha. whatever. it ruled. we had a good time. we went to get food (which I ate non of - I was nervous) and we got coffee. then we went to rodan to get drinks. we hung out until it was dangerous to hang out any more. so we left. <br/><br/>it was relaly hard to leave. as it always is. when I was walking away. I looked back and saw she was looking back at me too. that was kinda hard. so I shook my fist at her. ;) I rued the day. hahah. just kidding or I guess this is the internet so j/k. I am kidding. becase it was nice to see that she felt the same. or felt the same need to look back. that is of dreams. haha. <br/><br/>yea. I am a lot more emotional or upset about this - then I will admit(but I will blog it?? wtf?). it is just so weird to have feelings going both ways. because no matter which way you choose - it hurts. and we choose the safe way. but it is still hard. and I hate it when it is hard. but it is safe. and I like safety. but safety is sometimes really dumb. not like the other option is smart. just that both are hard.
<br/><br/>it was amazing though. how thoroughly we are able to be close - even with distance. I really missed her. which makes getting back to hanging out soooo nice. I am excited once again for what the future holds. which is strangely saying that I was once not excited. I am ALWAYS excited for what the future holds. <br/><br/>i like holding hands. haha. (totally helping). <b>;)</b><br/><br/>microphones however. are helping. <br/><br/> this week will be crazy. I have to get all ready fo india<br/>morgan says I shoudl get a phrase book - but I don&rsquo;t know where to get a phrase book at. I think I shoudl get a lot of money. but I also don&rsquo;t know where that is at either. someday. <br/><br/>today turned out t obe really good. I was quite apprehensive at the start. and in the end. it worked out very well. I am not disappointed. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.proxientunit.com">mike</a> is coming soon. I am excited. but I am also out of town. sad sad day. ;) he gets here thursday afternoon. so thursday night - the night before my 24hour flight. I will be engaging in a small amount of debachery. I am happy abotu that. <br/><br/>for those that are important: justice will be served. I promise.</p>
