  <div class="postcontent">
    <p>Ok Ok. so I have been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142000272/002-0399952-0374432?v=glance">Anna Karenina</a>. It is amazing. seriously - possibly one of the better books I have ever read. I am fascinated with how thorough Tolstoy covers the story. and how the story seemingly covers everything. it is soo good. I love the feeling of want that is associated with reading a good book..  right now I feel that the only thing that could satisfy my want is to go home and read that book - or write a web app to do fancy things with itunes. heh. hmm. I will probably read. but only because I am tired. but I have a really good idea. I should do it. <br/><br/>last night hiromi and I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230591/">one day in september</a>. it is about the palestinian terrorist organization black september&rsquo;s attack on the isreali 1972 olympic team. it was quite a good documentary. afterwards, while thinking about the movie - I thought of some things that I have been struggling with for the past couple weeks. first: why do we allow terrorism to work? and how do we react to disallow terrorism to effect us? and  second: if I was so pushed, would I participate in a terror movement. <br/><br/>to address the first consideration - it seems to me that terrorism wouldn&rsquo;t work if we didn&rsquo;t give into the fear. if we didn&rsquo;t give into the mob ideals of retribution and what not. in reagards to september 11th - what if we would have rebuilt the WTC bigger and better and not gone to war? I keep wondering how things would be different if we would have looked to the historics of isreal, the general middle east or N. Ireland for our reaction - rather than just blanketly attacked terrorism.  after watching the &ldquo;one day in sept.&rdquo; movie and seeing how the german government was not prepared for such a security violation - which in turn created a situation that allowed the terrorists to actually &ldquo;win&rdquo; and get their message out. what would have been a better way for the germans to react? should they have stormed in and just destroyed the terrorists with the potential for killing the hostages? I have no idea. <br/><br/>now the second thought is scarier. I guess I thought about this - cuz the palestinian guy was explaining how he had lived in refugee camps and all this horrible stuff and the terror organizations gave him hope and food. I thought &ldquo;what if that was me&rdquo; and it was somethign I believed in. like what if some larger country attempted to occupy the US - would I be a freedom fighter and attempt to destroy the moral of the enemy through terror and fear? I guess I probably would. but it is all so foreign to me. I mean. I think I woudl attempt to protect the U.S. however I could. &ldquo;protect freedom&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t think I could join the army and BLINDLY fight for truth. it woudl have to be more guerrilla. I think that scares me. I have no idea what I am talking about. I feel as though I am writing sentences with out regard for the previous sentence. <br/><br/>cat power is sad<br/><br/>so I updated some of my <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india">india pictures</a>. particularly - I added some from when <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0395.jpg">suresh</a>, <a href="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/events/2004%3A05%3A13_india/bangalore/IMG_0399.jpg">myself</a> and some of his friends went to cosmo village. I also added some pictures of what was in my <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0406.jpg">back</a> <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0407.jpg">yard</a>. it ruled. here <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0412.jpg">i am</a>. <a  href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0420.jpg">this</a> cart had HUGE wheels. it cracked me up. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0444.jpg">here</a> is a picture of JP, the driver. he rules so much. somewhere I found <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0459.jpg">this</a> poster which is about &ldquo;india&rsquo;s first all girl rock band.&rdquo;  heh. wtf. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0460.jpg">here</a> is one of the last pictures I took in india. it is vinay, his family, guru and myself. after we ate at this really crazy nice afghan place. I felt dirty - being american there. haha. whatever<br/><br/>i need to go home. it is almost 5:30. I have been here since 8:30. wtf. need. to. go. home.</p>
