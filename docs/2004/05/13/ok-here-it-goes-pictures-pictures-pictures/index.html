    <p>so I finally put the pictures up and here is the &ldquo;annotated&rdquo; guide to my photos. there are a bunch that I didn&rsquo;t include. check them out <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india">here</a>. I am not done. so I will be adding or modifying this entry soon. haha. word. <br/><br/>
so on sunday we drove from delhi to agra. on the way I saw a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0081.jpg">snake charmer</a> and a picture of a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0086.jpg">guy with a crazy mustache</a>. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0101.jpg">here is me</a> in front of the taj mahal. the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0107.jpg">taj mahal was incredible</a>. I am pretty sure that <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0109.jpg">this</a> is the guest house. the marble work was <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0117.jpg">insane</a>. seriously. you have no idea. apparently <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0124.jpg">this</a> is a famous place to take a picture. <br/><br/>after we saw the taj we went to the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&amp;img=IMG_0131.jpg">red fort</a>. it was also pretty <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0135.jpg">crazy and intricate</a>. from here you can see the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0147.jpg">taj pretty good</a>. apparently the guy that made the taj was banished to the red fort and was made to look on to his creation until he died. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0145.jpg">this is his fountain</a> and <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0146.jpg">this is his bedroom</a>. it was a nice bedroom. the work in the red stone  is very intricate. it is also <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0157.jpg">insane</a>.   <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0162.jpg">here</a> is one of my guides and i. <br/><br/>on the way back from agra to delhi I noticed a trend that I had never seen before. apaprently they buy the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0175.jpg">chassis</a> of the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0176.jpg">truck separate</a> from the truck and take it to another place to add the body. I think that <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0179.jpg">this</a> is a mosque. <br/><br/>in delhi I saw <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0222.jpg">this</a> amazing Bah?&lsquo;? Temple. it was so <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0223.jpg">spectacular</a> at night. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0227.jpg">here</a> is one of the auto-rickshaws that are everywhere. and as per usual I had to <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fdelhi_agra&img=IMG_0236.jpg">get on the plane</a> while it was parked on the tarmack. this has happened in frankfurt, delhi and bangalore. hehe. it is pretty awesome though. <br/><br/>so I flew to bangalore - which is an incredible city. as I flew in I could tell that it was a nice climate and that I would like it. since the elections are in full swing, they have <A href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0239.jpg">election signs</a> up all over. also a lot of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0241.jpg">technology signs</a> and a lot of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0242.jpg">construction</a>. all the construction apparently ends up looking like <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0256.jpg">this</a> but starts out looking like <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0257.jpg">this</a>. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0258.jpg">here </a> is the unicorn house. and of course the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0283.jpg">nike  factory store</a>.  there are a ton of <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0282.jpg">brightly painted trucks</a> everywhere. some of the <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0298.jpg">advertisments</a> really crack me up. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0307.jpg">this </a> is apparently a free hospital. it looks pretty cool and is only  about 5 years old. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0310.jpg">this</a> is itpl where I have been working for the past couple days. on the first night my friends took me to MG road which has <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0311.jpg">bunches of stores and such</a>. I took <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0345.jpg">this picture</a> for my more askew friends. the guest house where I stayed is <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=STE_0316.jpg">really nice</a>. it has a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0346.jpg">pool</a>.   my friends <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0349.jpg">guru and siddu</a> took me around a bunch - as has <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0355.jpg">suresh</a>.  suresh took me to a <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0354.jpg">club</a> where I hung out with some of his <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A05%3A13_india%2Fbangalore&img=IMG_0353.jpg">friends</a>.<br/><br/>so that is it so far. I plan to get a bunch more pictures in the next couple days of chruchs, temples and my friends. hoepfully I will see some good stuff. like I said before. I practice the <a href="http://www.lomography.com/content/about/rules/">rules</a> of <a href="http://www.lomography.com/">lomography</a> (even though I am digital) so some of the pictures may be lame ;). but whatever.</p>
