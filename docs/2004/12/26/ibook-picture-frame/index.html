I have always wanted a digital picture frame. I originally thought that the audrey  would fulfill my need - but it became apparent that i needed something much more powerful. I needed something that i could manage remotely and could run reasonable programs on. I needed a technology that would allow me to use open source software to display and manipulate the pictures as well as possible. I thought of using a custom linux solution - but decided that it would be cost prohibitive. I also noticed that there are a handfull of good picture frame tutorials already on the internet - so i checked them out and noticed a really nice powerbook hack as well as the apple duo hack and got to thinking about my roommates old clamshell ibook sitting in the corner&hellip;

<p>I have always wanted a digital picture frame. I originally thought that the <a href="http://www.audreyhacking.com">audrey </a> would fulfill my need - but it became apparent that i needed something much more powerful. I needed something that i could manage remotely and could run reasonable programs on. I needed a technology that would allow me to use open source software to display and manipulate the pictures as well as possible. I thought of using a custom linux solution - but decided that it would be cost prohibitive. I also noticed that there are a handfull of good picture frame tutorials already on the internet - so i checked them out and noticed a really nice powerbook <a href="http://www.applefritter.com/node/view/4971">hack</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.applefritter.com/hacks/duodigitalframe/index.html">apple duo</a> hack and got to thinking about my roommates old clamshell ibook sitting in the corner&hellip;</p>

<p></p>

<p>The clamshell ibook is a good choice because:
<ul>
    <li>OSX - it can natively run a lot of the apps i was dreaming about</li>
    <li>Small Form factor - it is already small and can get smaller thanks to Apples brilliant component design</li>
    <li>Good Screen - has a decent screen</li>
    <li>Heat dissipation - doesn&rsquo;t run hot</li>
    <li>Cheap - sub $500</li>
    <li>Ports - has airport(802.11), ethernet, usb and line out all built in.</li>
</ul>
So i went to it.</p>

<p>So around christmas time i flew to colorado to be with my family. I brought the remenants of my picture frame project from awhile ago to finish up in my fathers shop.</p>

<p>I shopped around for a frame that would be around 8x10 and would be deep enough to hold the mother board and such with the screen well enough. I thought about doing a custom frame, but i figured out (with dylan&rsquo;s help) that it would be prohibitively expensive. I eventually found two box frames that when stacked created enough depth to hold everything well. I then used some braces and some thick foam to hold the motherboard in.</p>

<p>It turned out really well.</p>

<p>here are some <strong>pictures:</strong>
<blockquote><img alt="All the pieces separated out" src="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1080109043-Nokia6600%28010%29.jpg" />All of the pieces separated out and fancilike.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img alt="In a box" src="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/pictures/misc/phone_camera/photolog/1080111294-Nokia6600%28012%29.jpg" />The initial test - in a box.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img alt="Ibook Picture Frame" src="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3818.jpg" />This is the frame i picked.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img alt="Power Connector" src="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3815.jpg" />This is where the power connector hooks. I have drilled a hole into the frame. It is an incredibly type fit.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img alt="Hard drive and airport card" src="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3816.jpg" />Here is a view of the hard drive and airport card.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img alt="Booting up" src="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3820.jpg" />Booting up</blockquote>
<blockquote><img alt="In action" src="http://nata2.info/.thumbnails/misc/misc_hacking/ibook_picture_frame/IMG_3840.jpg" /> The Frame in action</blockquote>
So. That is that. For the complete set of pictures check <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=misc%2Fmisc_hacking%2Fibook_picture_frame">here</a></p>
