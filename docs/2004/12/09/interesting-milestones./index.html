    <p>i was playing around with my blog software and I noticed something pretty cool. I have taken over 1000 pictures with my nokia cell phone cam and have roughly 2525 pictures total in my photolog. I have taken pictures of a bunch of neat stuff. it is pretty cool. I have wanted to make a view that is the text from the blog and the pictures all in one fancy view. but I haven&rsquo;t. maybe soon. haha. <br/><br/>today I received my free ipod mini. wtf. so apparently it works. I really don&rsquo;t know what to do with it. I guess use it. I feel weird getting a free thing this expensive. but I guess shit like this happens all the time. heh. I also picked up the best invention in the world: the <a href="http://nata2.info/pictures/misc/phone_camera/nokia_6600/081220042347/Nokia6600(029).jpg">tvB-gone</a>. basically it turns off all the tvs in its immediate view by sending out the commonly known IR off signals for north american tvs. it rules. all yesterday I was playing around at stores - turning off banks of tvs. it ruled. <br/><br/>i am attempting to pound out this site I am working on. it is kinda a pain. but whatever. I will finish er off. tonight is the first night I awhile I have been up past 1am. and I am not actually up past 1 yet. haha. I hope I don&rsquo;t screw this up. ;)<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nbc4i.com/news/3983630/detail.html">this</a> is absolutely insane. <blockquote><small>&ldquo;Two members of the heavy metal band Damageplan were reportedly shot and killed, including Dimebag Darrell, formerly with the band Pantera, NBC 4&rsquo;s David Wayne reported. The other band member&rsquo;s name was not released. The alleged gunman also died at the scene, Wayne reported.&rdquo;</small></blockquote></p>

<p>woah. wtf. metal is getting out of hand. the people who listen to it are mentally unstable. it is absolutely true. <br/><br/>in other news - I saw cradle of filth last night. they sucked. well not sucked like were horrible - just not as good as <a href="http://www.the-gothicworld.de/cdreviews/09-2003/dimmu-borgir.jpg">dimmu borgir</a>. also - it appears that <a href="http://cof.rockmetal.art.pl/images/galeria/1.jpg">danny filth</a> has an unreasonably <a href="http://cof.rockmetal.art.pl/images/galeria/13.jpg">large head</a>. it was nuts. he runs out on stage - and I was like - wtf. and I laughed. and then lost interest. however I gained interest in a band called <a href="http://www.trustkill.com/multimedia/videos/bleeding_hail.html">bleeding through</a>. not really anything new. but good energy. and there is a pretty girl playing keyboard. haha. what a dumb metal guy thing to say. silly silly.
<br/><br/>i think I am going to get a <a href="http://www.stripper-faq.org/">new job</a>. oh wait I am not a hot girl. so I guess I am not going to. but if I become a hot girl. hells yea. speaking of hot ladies - lately I have been playing with OS X a lot. it rules. so so so smooth. I like it. basically I just ssh into it and play how I like. none of that monitor nonsense. just shell all the way. I love it. <br/><br/><3<br/><br/>i am going to open my ipod now.</p>
