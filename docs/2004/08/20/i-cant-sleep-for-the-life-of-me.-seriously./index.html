    <p>it doesn&rsquo;t work. having a crazy scedule where you are up from 11 to 6 and sleep from 6 to 9 and then are up from 9 until 6 is insane. it creates ghosts in my head. I was hanging out at work yesterday morning - about 24hrs ago - and I thought I heard voices calling my name. I scurried off home. full of fear of zombies and demons. it ruled. I even took a cab. cuz I didn&rsquo;t trust the train. place is full of zombies. <br/><br/>there is almost no way in hell I am going to arrive at work tomorrow on time. but wtf. they did this to me. I mean. I tried to sleep. hahaha. but I keep wakign up at like 11 raring to go.<br/><br/>so I just read Haruki Murakami&rsquo;s &ldquo;Norwegian Wood.&rdquo; it is so good. I quite like Murakami. his writing so very haunting. it reminds me of real life sometimes. or how I picture real life to be. if it were real. real life that is. all of his characters seem to have a dark cloud hovering above them at all times. something deep and brooding. it makes the characters seem more real than most novels that I read. well that may be alive. I love having feelings while reading a book. in the past six months it has happened three times - the first was in &ldquo;the world accoding to garp&rdquo; when garp&rsquo;s son dies. that was sad. and how john irving used what we didn&rsquo;t know to tell us was beautiful. it was really incredible how it worked out. but it was also so horrifying. I love being in a situation were I have to put down the book and think about it. as if I was actually involved. the book is an involvamatron. the next time was in anna karenina when levin and kitty got together. at the time my feeling was very strong - I could explain it to anyone - but now I am forgetting. it was great though. I think it was the theme. actually that whole book was incredible. I remember my friend <a href="http://thom.watership.org/">thom</a> mentioning that I should read it cuz it was his dads favorite. or something. I was like &ldquo;i should.&rdquo; and I did. it is one of my favorites I think as well. <br/><br/>so then the next time I was &ldquo;moved&rdquo; by a book was in norwegion wood - when watanabe is sad about naoko and he accidently ignores midori and hurts her - the letter that midori writes him is so sad. it really made me think for a bit. <br/><br/>sometimes though feelings are stupid. haha. <br/><br/>i just got a email from asstraffic. I imagine it is full of surprises and exciting offers for enlarging things. stupid things. <br/><br/>i need to read the great gatsby. someone <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5a3hl">buy it for me</a>. ok. thanks.<br/><br/>i have been listening to mastodon. it is really good. I like it quite a but. my vocabulary sucks. I want to go on a date. I am tired. <br/><br/>heh. if you haven&rsquo;t visited <a href="http://thom.watership.org/">thom&rsquo;s webpage</a> you should his pictures are incredible. it makes me sad that I am not dong what he is doing. I miss the mountains and the nature and the whales. wtf. right. <br/><br/>i obviously shouldn&rsquo;t write entries at 4:30 in the morning after reading a dark dark book. <br/><br/>i think one of my favorite things is reading a whole book in one sitting. I love abondoning things and doing something completely not related and just engaging 110%. it makes me feel so good. it could be my favorite thing. not abandoning things - but reading books. favorite above all. <br/><br/>oh yea. <a href="http://nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fevents%2F2004%3A08%3A19_lakshmis_going_away_party">here</a> are some pictures from work today. and after work I went to hard rock for a beer and saw gary colemon. wtf indeed. <a href="http://operationhammertime.org/">this is funny</a> and <a href="http://zed.cbc.ca/go.ZeD?CONTENT_ID=2365&mediaSize=double&page=media-viewer">this</a> is awesome.</p>
