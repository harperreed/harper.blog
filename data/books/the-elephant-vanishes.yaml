description: "<i>Alternate cover edition <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17181679-the-elephant-vanishes\"\
  \ rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i><br /><br />When a man\u2019s favourite elephant\
  \ vanishes, the balance of his whole life is subtly upset; a couple\u2019s midnight\
  \ hunger pangs drive them to hold up a McDonald\u2019s; a woman finds she is irresistible\
  \ to a small green monster that burrows through her front garden; an insomniac wife\
  \ wakes up to a twilight world of semi-consciousness in which anything seems possible\u2014\
  even death. In every one of the stories that make up <i>The Elephant Vanishes</i>,\
  \ Murakami makes a determined assault on the normal. He has a deadpan genius for\
  \ dislocating realities to uncover the surreal in the everyday, the extraordinary\
  \ in the ordinary."
