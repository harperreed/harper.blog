description: "<b>A thriller of war that never was\u2014of survival in an impossible\
  \ city\u2014of surreal cataclysm. In <i>The Last Days of New Paris</i>, China Mi\xE9\
  ville entwines true historical events and people with his daring, uniquely imaginative\
  \ brand of fiction, reconfiguring history and art into something new.</b><br />\
  \ \_<br /><i>\u201CBeauty will be convulsive. . . .\u201D</i><br /> \_<br /> 1941.\
  \ In the chaos of wartime Marseilles, American engineer\u2014and occult disciple\u2014\
  Jack Parsons stumbles onto a clandestine anti-Nazi group, including Surrealist theorist\
  \ Andr\xE9 Breton. In the strange games of the dissident diplomats, exiled revolutionaries,\
  \ and avant-garde artists, Parsons finds and channels hope. But what he unwittingly\
  \ unleashes is the power of dreams and nightmares, changing the war and the world\
  \ forever.<br /> \_<br /> 1950. A lone Surrealist fighter, Thibault, walks a new,\
  \ hallucinogenic Paris, where Nazis and the R\xE9sistance are trapped in unending\
  \ conflict, and the streets are stalked by living images and texts\u2014and by the\
  \ forces of Hell. To escape the city, he must join forces with Sam, an American\
  \ photographer intent on recording the ruins, and make common cause with a powerful,\
  \ enigmatic figure of chance and rebellion: the Exquisite Corpse.<br /> \_<br />\
  \ But Sam is being hunted. And new secrets will emerge that will test all their\
  \ loyalties\u2014to each other, to Paris old and new, and to reality itself.<br\
  \ /> \_"
