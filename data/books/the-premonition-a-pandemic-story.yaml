description: "<b>For those who could read between the lines, the censored news out\
  \ of China was terrifying. But the president insisted there was nothing to worry\
  \ about.</b><br /><br />Fortunately, we are still a nation of skeptics. Fortunately,\
  \ there are those among us who study pandemics and are willing to look unflinchingly\
  \ at worst-case scenarios. Michael Lewis\u2019s taut and brilliant nonfiction thriller\
  \ pits a band of medical visionaries against the wall of ignorance that was the\
  \ official response of the Trump administration to the outbreak of COVID-19.<br\
  \ /><br />The characters you will meet in these pages are as fascinating as they\
  \ are unexpected. A thirteen-year-old girl\u2019s science project on transmission\
  \ of an airborne pathogen develops into a very grown-up model of disease control.\
  \ A local public-health officer uses her worm\u2019s-eye view to see what the CDC\
  \ misses, and reveals great truths about American society. A secret team of dissenting\
  \ doctors, nicknamed the Wolverines, has everything necessary to fight the pandemic:\
  \ brilliant backgrounds, world-class labs, prior experience with the pandemic scares\
  \ of bird flu and swine flu\u2026everything, that is, except official permission\
  \ to implement their work.<br /><br />Michael Lewis is not shy about calling these\
  \ people heroes for their refusal to follow directives that they know to be based\
  \ on misinformation and bad science. Even the internet, as crucial as it is to their\
  \ exchange of ideas, poses a risk to them. They never know for sure who else might\
  \ be listening in."
