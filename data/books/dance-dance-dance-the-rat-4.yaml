description: In this propulsive novel by the author of <i>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and
  the End of the World</i> and <i>The Elephant Vanishes</i>, one of the most idiosyncratically
  brilliant writers at work in any language fuses science fiction, the hard-boiled
  thriller and white-hot satire into a new element of the literary periodic table.<br
  /><br />As he searches for a mysteriously vanished girlfriend, Haruki Murakami's
  protagonist plunges into a wind tunnel of sexual violence and metaphysical dread
  in which he collides with call girls; plays chaperone to a lovely teenaged psychic;
  and receives cryptic instructions from a shabby but oracular Sheep Man. <i>Dance
  Dance Dance</i> is a tense, poignant, and often hilarious ride through the cultural
  Cuisinart that is contemporary Japan, a place where everything that is not up for
  sale is up for grabs.
