description: Retired from his fighting days, John Perry is now village ombudsman for
  a human colony on distant Huckleberry. With his wife, former Special Forces warrior
  Jane Sagan, he farms several acres, adjudicates local disputes, and enjoys watching
  his adopted daughter grow up.<br /><br />That is, until his and Jane's past reaches
  out to bring them back into the game--as leaders of a new human colony, to be peopled
  by settlers from all the major human worlds, for a deep political purpose that will
  put Perry and Sagan back in the thick of interstellar politics, betrayal, and war.
