description: "<b>On a crowded train platform, Interpol agent Kenneth Durand feels\
  \ the sting of a needle\u2014 and his transformation begins. . . .\_</b><br /> \_\
  <br /> In 2045 Kenneth Durand leads Interpol\u2019s most effective team against\
  \ genetic crime, hunting down black market labs that perform \"vanity edits\" on\
  \ human embryos for a price. These illegal procedures augment embryos in ways that\
  \ are rapidly accelerating human evolution\u2014preying on human-trafficking victims\
  \ to experiment and advance their technology.<br /> \_<br /> With the worlds of\
  \ genetic crime and human trafficking converging, Durand and his fellow Interpol\
  \ agents discover that one figure looms behind it all: Marcus Demang Wyckes, leader\
  \ of a powerful and sophisticated cartel known as the Huli jing.<br /> \_<br />\
  \ But the Huli jing have identified Durand, too. After being forcibly dosed with\
  \ a radical new change agent, Durand wakes from a coma weeks later to find he\u2019\
  s been genetically transformed into someone else\u2014his most wanted suspect: Wyckes.<br\
  \ /> \_<br /> Now a fugitive, pursued through the genetic underworld by his former\
  \ colleagues and the police, Durand is determined to restore his original DNA by\
  \ locating the source of the mysterious\u2014and highly valuable\u2014change agent.\
  \ But Durand hasn\u2019t anticipated just how difficult locating his enemy will\
  \ be. With the technology to genetically edit the living, Wyckes and his Huli jing\
  \ could be anyone and everyone\u2014and they have plans to undermine identity itself.<br\
