description: 'A chilling, globe-spanning detective story, tracking an elite group
  of Russian hackers and the future of global warfare<br /><br />In 2014, the world
  witnessed the start of an escalating series of cyberattacks. Targeting American
  utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, the strikes became
  ever more brazen, eventually leading to the first-ever blackouts triggered by hackers.
  They culminated in the summer of 2017 when malware known as NotPetya was unleashed,
  compromising, disrupting, and paralyzing some of the world''s largest companies.
  At the attack''s epicenter in Ukraine, ATMs froze. The railway and postal systems
  shut down. NotPetya spread around the world, inflicting an unprecedented ten billions
  of dollars in damage--the largest, most penetrating cyberattack the world had ever
  seen.<br /><br />The hackers behind these attacks are quickly gaining a reputation
  as the most dangerous team of cyberwarriors in the internet''s history: Sandworm.
  Believed to be working in the service of Russia''s military intelligence agency,
  they represent a persistent, highly skilled, state-sponsored hacking force, one
  whose talents are matched by their willingness to launch broad, unrestrained attacks
  on the most critical infrastructure of their adversaries. They target government
  and private sector, military and civilians alike.<br /><br />From WIRED senior writer
  Andy Greenberg comes Sandworm, the true story of the desperate hunt to identify
  and track those attackers. It considers the danger this force poses to our national
  stability and security. And as the Kremlin''s role in manipulating foreign governments
  and sparking chaos globally comes into greater focus, Sandworm reveals the realities
  not just of Russia''s global digital offensive, but of an era where warfare ceases
  to be waged on the battlefield--where the line between digital and physical conflict
  begins to blur, with world-shaking implications.'
