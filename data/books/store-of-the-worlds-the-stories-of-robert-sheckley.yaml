description: "Robert Sheckley was science fiction\u2019s in-house reply to the<br\
  \ /> black humorists of the 1950s and 60s: Bruce Jay Friedman,<br /> Terry Southern,\
  \ and the young Thomas Pynchon were his nonetoo-<br /> distant relatives; Mort Sahl\u2019\
  s comedy, Charles Schultz\u2019s<br /> cartoons, and Tom Lehrer\u2019s songs all\
  \ mined similar veins.<br /> Sheckley targeted the conformity and consumerism of\
  \ our<br /> mid-century technotopia while it was still under construction.<br />\
  \ His new worlds, alternate universes, and future dystopias have<br /> only become\
  \ more present with the passing years, even as his<br /> career, played out both\
  \ in the pulp magazines and in front-line<br /> venues like <i>Playboy </i>and <i>Omni</i>,\
  \ is a glimpse of a time when<br /> \u201Cscience fiction writer\u201D could be\
  \ a kind of hipster credential.<br /> Mordant, absurdist, and deadpan, the best\
  \ of Sheckley\u2019s dissident<br /> farces represent science fiction\u2019s high-water\
  \ mark as an<br /> allegorical clearinghouse for twenty-century angst."
