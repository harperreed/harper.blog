description: Learn the tricks of the trade so you can build and architect applications
  that scale quickly--without all the high-priced headaches and service-level agreements
  associated with enterprise app servers and proprietary programming and database
  products. Culled from the experience of the Flickr.com lead developer, <i>Building
  Scalable Web Sites</i> offers techniques for creating fast sites that your visitors
  will find a pleasure to use.<br /><br /> Creating popular sites requires much more
  than fast hardware with lots of memory and hard drive space. It requires thinking
  about how to grow over time, how to make the same resources accessible to audiences
  with different expectations, and how to have a team of developers work on a site
  without creating new problems for visitors and for each other.<br /><br /> Presenting
  information to visitors from all over the world<br /><br /><i> Integrating email
  with your web applications<br /><br /></i> Planning hardware purchases and hosting
  options to have as much as you need without breaking your wallet<br /><br /><i>
  Partitioning and distributing databases to support large datasets and simultaneous
  transactions<br /><br /></i> Monitoring your applications to find and clear bottlenecks<br
  /><br /> * Providing services APIs and using services from other providers to increase
  your site's reach and capabilities<br /><br /> Whether you're starting a small web
  site with hopes of growing big or you already have a large system that needs maintenance,
  you'll find <i>Building Scalable Web Sites</i> to be a library of ideas for making
  things work.
