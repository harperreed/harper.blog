description: An unexpected quest. Two worlds at stake. Are you ready?<br /><br />Days
  after Oasis founder James Halliday's contest, Wade Watts makes a discovery that
  changes everything.<br /><br />Hidden within Halliday's vault, waiting for his heir
  to find, lies a technological advancement that will once again change the world
  and make the Oasis a thousand times more wondrous, and addictive, than even Wade
  dreamed possible. With it comes a new riddle and a new quest. A last Easter egg
  from Halliday, hinting at a mysterious prize.<br /><br />And an unexpected, impossibly
  powerful, and dangerous new rival awaits, one who will kill millions to get what
  he wants. Wade's life and the future of the Oasis are again at stake, but this time
  the fate of humanity also hangs in the balance.
