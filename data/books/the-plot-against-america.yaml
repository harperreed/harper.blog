description: "When the renowned aviation hero and rabid isolationist Charles A. Lindbergh\
  \ defeated Franklin Roosevelt by a landslide in the 1940 presidential election,\
  \ fear invaded every Jewish household in America. Not only had Lindbergh, in a nationwide\
  \ radio address, publicly blamed the Jews for sel\uFB01shly pushing America toward\
  \ a pointless war with Nazi Germany, but upon taking of\uFB01ce as the thirty-third\
  \ president of the United States, he negotiated a cordial \u201Cunderstanding\u201D\
  \ with Adolf Hitler, whose conquest of Europe and virulent anti-Semitic policies\
  \ he appeared to accept without dif\uFB01culty.<p>What then followed in America\
  \ is the historical setting for this startling new book by Pulitzer Prize\u2013\
  winner Philip Roth, who recounts what it was like for his Newark family \u2014 and\
  \ for a million such families all over the country \u2014 during the menacing years\
  \ of the Lindbergh presidency, when American citizens who happened to be Jews had\
  \ every reason to expect the worst.<br />(front flap)</p>"
