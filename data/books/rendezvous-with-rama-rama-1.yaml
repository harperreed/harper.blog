description: An all-time science fiction classic, <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> is also
  one of Clarke's best novels--it won the Campbell, Hugo, Jupiter, and Nebula Awards.
  A huge, mysterious, cylindrical object appears in space, swooping in toward the
  sun. The citizens of the solar system send a ship to investigate before the enigmatic
  craft, called Rama, disappears. The astronauts given the task of exploring the hollow
  cylindrical ship are able to decipher some, but definitely not all, of the extraterrestrial
  vehicle's puzzles. From the ubiquitous trilateral symmetry of its structures to
  its cylindrical sea and machine-island, Rama's secrets are strange evidence of an
  advanced civilization. But who, and where, are the Ramans, and what do they want
  with humans? Perhaps the answer lies with the busily working biots, or the sealed-off
  buildings, or the inaccessible "southern" half of the enormous cylinder. Rama's
  unsolved mysteries are tantalizing indeed. <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> is fast moving,
  fascinating, and a must-read for science fiction fans. Clarke collaborated with
  Gentry Lee in writing several Rama sequels, beginning with <i>Rama II</i>.
