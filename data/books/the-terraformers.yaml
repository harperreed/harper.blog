description: "Destry is a top network analyst with the Environmental Rescue Team,\
  \ an ancient organization devoted to preventing ecosystem collapse. On the planet\
  \ Sask-E, her mission is to terraform an Earthlike world, with the help of her taciturn\
  \ moose, Whistle. But then she discovers a city that isn't supposed to exist, hidden\
  \ inside a massive volcano. Torn between loyalty to the ERT and the truth of the\
  \ planet's history, Destry makes a decision that echoes down the generations.<br\
  \ /><br />Centuries later, Destry's protege, Misha, is building a planetwide transit\
  \ system when his worldview is turned upside-down by Sulfur, a brilliant engineer\
  \ from the volcano city. Together, they uncover a dark secret about the real estate\
  \ company that's buying up huge swaths of the planet\u2015a secret that could destroy\
  \ the lives of everyone who isn't Homo sapiens. Working with a team of robots, naked\
  \ mole rats, and a very angry cyborg cow, they quietly sow seeds of subversion.\
  \ But when they're threatened with violent diaspora, Misha and Sulfur's very unusual\
  \ child faces a stark choice: deploy a planet-altering weapon, or watch their people\
  \ lose everything they've built on Sask-E."
