description: 'Librarian''s Note: Alternate Edition with same isbn &amp; isbn 13: January
  2011<br /><br />THE EXTRAORDINARY AND MAGNIFICENT EPIC CONCLUSION TO THE HUGO AWARD-NOMINATED
  ILIUM<br /><br />Beneath the gaze of the gods, the mighty armies of Greece and Troy
  met in fierce and glorious combat, scrupulously following the text set forth in
  Homer''s timeless narrative, but that was before twenty-first century scholar Thomas
  Hockenberry stirred the bloody brew, causing an enraged Achilles to join forces
  with his archenemy Hector and turn his murderous wrath on Zeus and the entire pantheon
  of divine manipulators; before the swift and terrible mechanical creatures that
  catered for centuries to the pitiful idle remnants of Earth''s human race began
  massing in the millions, to exterminate rather than serve.<br /><br />And now all
  bets are off.'
