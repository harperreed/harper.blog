description: "Reality TV and advanced technology make for high drama in this political\
  \ thriller that combines the military action of <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i> with the\
  \ classic science fiction of <i>The Forever War</i>.<br /><br />Lieutenant James\
  \ Shelley, who has an uncanny knack for premeditating danger, leads a squad of advanced\
  \ US Army military tasked with enforcing the peace around a conflict in sub-Saharan\
  \ Africa. The squad members are linked wirelessly 24/7 to themselves and a central\
  \ intelligence that guides them via drone relay\u2014and unbeknownst to Shelley\
  \ and his team, they are being recorded for a reality TV show.<br /><br />When an\
  \ airstrike almost destroys their outpost, a plot begins to unravel that\u2019s\
  \ worthy of Crichton and Clancy\u2019s best. The conflict soon involves rogue defense\
  \ contractors, corrupt US politicians, and homegrown terrorists who possess nuclear\
  \ bombs. Soon Shelley must accept that the helpful warnings in his head could be\
  \ AI. But what is the cost of serving its agenda?"
