description: "In <i>A Corpse in the Koryo, </i>James Church introduced readers to\
  \ one of the most unique detectives to appear on page in years \u2014 the elusive\
  \ Inspector O. The stunning mystery was named one of the best mystery/thrillers\
  \ of 2006 by the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> for its beautifully spare prose and layered\
  \ descriptions of a terrain Church knows by heart.<br /><br />And now the Inspector\
  \ is back. In <i>Hidden Moon</i>, Inspector O returns from a mission abroad to find\
  \ his new police commander waiting at his office door. There has been a bank robbery\
  \ \u2014 the first ever in Pyongyang \u2014 and the commander demands action, and\
  \ quickly. But is this urgency for real? \_ Somewhere, someone in the North Korean\
  \ leadership doesn\u2019t want Inspector O to complete his investigation. And why\
  \ not? What if the robbery leads to the highest levels of the regime? What if power,\
  \ not a need for cash, is the real reason behind the heist at the Gold Star Bank?<br\
  \ /><br />Given a choice, this isn\u2019t a trail a detective in the Pyongyang police\
  \ would want to follow all the way to the end, even a trail marked with monogrammed\
  \ silk stockings. \u201CI\u2019m not sure I know where the bank is,\u201D is O\u2019\
  s laconic observation as the warning bells go off in his head. A Scottish policeman\
  \ sent to provide security for a visiting British official, a sultry Kazakh bank\
  \ manager, and a mournful fellow detective all combine to put O in the middle of\
  \ a spiderweb of conspiracies that becomes more tangled, and dangerous, the more\
  \ he pulls on the threads.<br /><br />Once again, as he did in <i>A</i> <i>Corpse\
  \ in the Koryo,</i> James Church opens a window onto a society where nothing is\
  \ quite as it seems. The story serves as the reader\u2019s flashlight,<b>\n  <i>\
  \ </i>\n</b>illuminating a place that outsiders imagine is always dark and too far\
  \ away to know. Church\u2019s descriptions of the country and its people are spare\
  \ and starkly beautiful; the dialogue is lean, every thought weighed and measured\
  \ before it is spoken. Not a word is wasted, because in this place no one can afford\
  \ to be misunderstood."
