description: Since his first published story, "Apartness," appeared in 1965, Vernor
  Vinge has forged a unique and awe-inspiring career in science fiction as his work
  has grown and matured. He is now one of the most celebrated science fiction writers
  in the field , having won the field's top award, the Hugo, for each of his last
  two novels.<br /><br />Now, for the first time, this illustrious author gathers
  all his short fiction into a single volume. This collection is truly the definitive
  Vinge, capturing his visionary ideas at their very best. It also contains a never-before-published
  novella, one that represents precisely what this collection encapsulates--bold,
  unique, challenging science fictional ideas brought to vivid life with compelling
  storytelling.<br /><br />Including such major pieces as "The Ungoverned" and "The
  Blabber," this sumptuous volume will satisfy any reader who loves the sense of wonder,
  and the excitement of great SF.<br /><br />The volume collects Vinge's short fiction
  through 2001 (except "True Names", including Vinge's comments from the earlier two
  volumes.)<br /><br />Contents:<br />"Bookworm, Run!"<br />"The Accomplice"<br />"The
  Peddler's Apprentice" (with Joan D. Vinge)<br />"The Ungoverned"<br />"Long Shot"<br
  />"Apartness"<br />"Conquest by Default"<br />"The Whirligig of Time"<br />"Bomb
  Scare"<br />"The Science Fair"<br />"Gemstone"<br />"Just Peace" (with William Rupp)<br
  />"Original Sin"<br />"The Blabber"<br />"Win A Nobel Prize!" (originally published
  in Nature, Vol 407 No 6805 "Futures")<br />"The Barbarian Princess" (this is also
  the first section of "Tatja Grimm's World")<br />"Fast Times at Fairmont High" (occurs
  in the same milieu as Rainbows End) (winner 2002 Hugo Award for Best Novella)

      description: "Thousands of years from now, a mind's potential is determined\
        \ by its location in space\u2014from superintelligent entities in the Transcend,\
        \ to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures\
        \ and technology can function. Nobody knows what strange force partitioned\
        \ space into these \"regions of thought,\" but when the warring Straumli realm\
        \ use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash\
        \ an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural\
        \ and artificial intelligence.\n    \n    Vernor Vinge first used the concepts\
        \ of <i>\"Zones of Thought\"</i> in a 1988 novella, <i>\"The Blabber\"</i>,\
        \ which occurs after Fire. Vinge's novel, <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>, is\
        \ a prequel to <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> set 20,000 years earlier and featuring\
        \ Pham Nuwen. Vinge's <i>Children of the Sky</i> is \"a near-term sequel to\
        \ A Fire Upon the Deep\", set ten years later.\n    \n    Vinge's former wife,\
        \ Joan D. Vinge, has also written stories in the Zones of Thought universe,\
        \ based on his notes. These include <i>\"The Outcasts of Heaven Belt\"</i>\
        \ and <i>\"Legacy\"</i>.\n    \n    Vernor Vinge won a Hugo Award for <i>A\
        \ Fire Upon the Deep</i>. He also won a Hugo, a John W. Campbell and a Prometheus\
        \ Award for <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>.\n    \n    \n    Publication order\
        \ is as follows:\n    \n    A Fire Upon the Deep\n    A Deepness in the Sky\n\
        \    The Children of the Sky\n    \n    \n    Chronological order is:\n  \
        \  \n    A Deepness in the Sky\n    A Fire Upon the Deep\n    The Children\
        \ of the Sky\n    \n    Some say \"The first book can be read as a stand-alone.\
        \ Book 3 is the continuation of book 1, and has less of the space opera element.\
        \ Book 2 can be skipped from the story, or can be read as itts own book. In\
        \ the timeline it is a prequel but it is loosely related to book 1.\""
