description: "<b>Hugo award\u2013nominated author Stina Leicht has created a take\
  \ on space opera for fans of <i>The Mandalorian</i> and <i>Cowboy Bebop </i>in this\
  \ high-stakes adventure.</b><br /><br />Persephone Station, a seemingly backwater\
  \ planet that has largely been ignored by the United Republic of Worlds becomes\
  \ the focus for the Serrao-Orlov Corporation as the planet has a few secrets the\
  \ corporation tenaciously wants to exploit.<br /> <br />Rosie--owner of Monk\u2019\
  s Bar, in the corporate town of West Brynner, caters to wannabe criminals and rich\
  \ Earther tourists, of a sort, at the front bar. However, exactly two types of people\
  \ drank at Monk\u2019s back bar: members of a rather exclusive criminal class and\
  \ those who sought to employ them.<br /> <br />Angel--ex-marine and head of a semi-organized\
  \ band of beneficent criminals, wayward assassins, and washed up mercenaries with\
  \ a penchant for doing the honorable thing is asked to perform a job for Rosie.\
  \ What this job reveals will effect Persephone and put Angel and her squad up against\
  \ an army. Despite the odds, they are rearing for a fight with the Serrao-Orlov\
  \ Corporation. For Angel, she knows that once honor is lost, there is no regaining\
  \ it. That doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t damned well try."
