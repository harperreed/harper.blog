description: "<b>Now a Netflix original movie, this deeply scary and intensely unnerving\
  \ novel follows a couple in the midst of a twisted unraveling of the darkest unease.\
  \ You will be scared. But you won\u2019t know why\u2026</b><br /><br /><i>I\u2019\
  m thinking of ending things. Once this thought arrives, it stays. It sticks. It\
  \ lingers. It\u2019s always there. Always.</i><br /> <br /> <i>Jake once said, \u201C\
  Sometimes a thought is closer to truth, to reality, than an action. You can say\
  \ anything, you can do anything, but you can\u2019t fake a thought.\u201D</i><br\
  \ /> <br /> <i>And here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking: I don\u2019t want to be here.</i><br\
  \ /> <br />In this smart and intense literary suspense novel, Iain Reid explores\
  \ the depths of the human psyche, questioning consciousness, free will, the value\
  \ of relationships, fear, and the limitations of solitude. Reminiscent of Jose Saramago\u2019\
  s early work, Michel Faber\u2019s cult classic <i>Under the Skin</i>, and Lionel\
  \ Shriver\u2019s <i>We Need to Talk about Kevin</i>, <i>\u201C</i>your dread and\
  \ unease will mount with every passing page\u201D (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)\
  \ of this edgy, haunting debut. Tense, gripping, and atmospheric, <i>I\u2019m Thinking\
  \ of Ending Things</i> pulls you in from the very first page\u2026and never lets\
  \ you go."
