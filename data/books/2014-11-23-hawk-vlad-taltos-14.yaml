      description: "Steven Brust's fantasy series follows Vlad Taltos: a short-statured,\
        \ short-lived human in an Empire of tall, long-lived Dragaerans.\n    \n \
        \   http://us.macmillan.com/series/vlad\n    \n    This is one series set\
        \ in Steven Brust's <a href=http://www.goodreads.com/series/49760-draegara>Dragaeran\
        \ world.</a>\n    \n    Of the ordering, the author notes:<blockquote>One\
        \ of the questions I'm most often asked is: \"In what order would you recommend\
        \ reading these books?\" Unfortunately, I'm just exactly the wrong guy to\
        \ ask. I made every effort to write them so that they could be read in any\
        \ order. I am aware that, in some measure at least, I have failed (I certainly\
        \ wouldn't recommend starting with <i>Teckla</i>, for example), but the fact\
        \ that I was trying makes me incapable of giving an answer.\n    \n    Many\
        \ people whose opinion I respect believe publication order is best . . . The\
        \ choice, I daresay, is yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy them.\n    \n\
        \    --Steven Brust, 1999, in the notes for <i>The Book of Jhereg</i></blockquote>The\
        \ books are numbered in publication order;  here is a rough guide to chronological\
        \ order:\n    \n        Taltos (1988)\n        Dragon (1998)\n        Yendi\
        \ (1984)\n        Tiassa, section 1 (2011)\n        Jhereg (1983)\n      \
        \  Teckla (1987)\n        Phoenix (1990)\n        Jhegaala (2008)\n      \
        \  Athyra (1993)\n        Orca (1996)\n        Issola (2001)\n        Dzur\
