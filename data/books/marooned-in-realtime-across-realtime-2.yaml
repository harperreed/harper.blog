description: Multiple Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge takes readers on a fifty-million-year
  trip to a future where humanity's fate will be decided in a dangerous game of high-tech
  survival.<br /><br />In this taut thriller, a Hugo finalist for Best Novel, nobody
  knows why there are only three hundred humans left alive on the Earth fifty million
  years from now. Opinion is fiercely divided on whether to settle in and plant the
  seed of mankind anew, or to continue using high-energy stasis fields, or "bobbles,"
  in venturing into the future. When somebody is murdered, it's obvious someone has
  a secret he or she is willing to kill to preserve.The murder intensifies the rift
  between the two factions, threatening the survival of the human race. It's up to
  21st century detective Wil Brierson, the only cop left in the world, to find the
  culprit, a diabolical fiend whose lust for power could cause the utter extinction
  of man.<br /><br />Filled with excitement and adventure, Vinge's tense SF puzzler
  will satisfy readers with its sense of wonder and engaging characters, one of whom
  is a murderer with a unique modus operandi.
