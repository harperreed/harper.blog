description: "<b>By day she writes comic books. By night, she lives them.</b><br /><br\
  \ />MG Martin lives and breathes geek culture. She even works as a writer for the\
  \ comic book company she idolized as a kid. But despite her love of hooded vigilantes,\
  \ MG prefers her comics stay <i>on</i> the page.<br /><br />But when someone in\
  \ LA starts recreating crime scenes from her favorite comic book, MG is the LAPD\u2019\
  s best\u2014and only\u2014lead. She recognizes the golden arrow left at the scene\
  \ as the calling card of her favorite comic book hero. The thing is\u2026superheroes\
  \ aren\u2019t <i>real</i>. Are they?<br /><br />When the too-handsome-for-his-own-good\
  \ Detective Kildaire asks for her comic book expertise, MG is more than up for the\
  \ adventure. Unfortunately, MG has a <i>teeny</i> little tendency to not follow\
  \ rules. And her off-the-books sleuthing may land her in a world of trouble.<br\
  \ /><br />Because for every superhero, there is a supervillain. And the villain\
  \ of her story may be closer than she thinks\u2026"
