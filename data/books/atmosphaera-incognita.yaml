description: "For more than two decades, Neal Stephenson has been the reigning master\
  \ of the epic fictional narrative. His vast, intellectually rigorous books have\
  \ ranged in setting from the distant past (The Baroque Cycle) to the modern era\
  \ (<i>Reamde</i>) to the remote future (<i>Anathem</i>, <i>Seveneves</i>). But when\
  \ Stephenson turns his attention to shorter forms, the results can be every bit\
  \ as impressive, as this dazzling novella\u2014itself a kind of tightly compressed\
  \ epic\u2014clearly indicates. <b>Atmosph\xE6ra Incognita</b> is a beautifully detailed,\
  \ high-tech rendering of a tale as old as the Biblical Tower of Babel. It is an\
  \ account, scrupulously imagined, of the years-long construction of a twenty-kilometer-high\
  \ tower that will bring the human enterprise, in all its complexity, to the threshold\
  \ of outer space. It is a story of persistence, of visionary imaginings, of the\
  \ ceaseless technological innovation needed to bring these imaginings to life. At\
  \ the same time, it shows us our familiar planet from an entirely new perspective,\
  \ and offers vivid snapshots of the unique beauties and unexpected hazards of the\
  \ \u201Catmosph\xE6ra incognita\u201D that lies between this world and \u201Cthe\
  \ deep ocean of the cosmos.\u201D The result is pure pleasure, pure excitement,\
  \ pure Neal Stephenson. No one with an interest in Stephenson's work, or in science\
  \ fiction at its most thoughtful and ambitious, can afford to miss this latest edition\
  \ to an extraordinary body of work."
