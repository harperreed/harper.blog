description: "<b>An impossible crime. A detective on the edge of madness. The future\
  \ of time travel at stake.</b><br /><br />January Cole\u2019s job just got a whole\
  \ lot harder.<br /><br />Not that running security at the Paradox was ever really\
  \ easy. Nothing\u2019s simple at a hotel where the ultra-wealthy tourists arrive\
  \ costumed for a dozen different time periods, all eagerly waiting to catch their\
  \ \u201Cflights\u201D to the past.<br /><br />Or where proximity to the timeport\
  \ makes the clocks run backward on occasion\u2014and, rumor has it, allows ghosts\
  \ to stroll the halls.<br /><br />None of that compares to the corpse in room 526.\
  \ The one that seems to be both there and not there. The one that somehow only January\
  \ can see.<br /><br />On top of that, some very important new guests have just checked\
  \ in. Because the U.S. government is about to privatize time-travel technology\u2014\
  and the world\u2019s most powerful people are on hand to stake their claims.<br\
  \ /><br />January is sure the timing isn\u2019t a coincidence. Neither are those\
  \ \u201Caccidents\u201D that start stalking their bidders.<br /><br />There\u2019\
  s a reason January can glimpse what others can\u2019t. A reason why she\u2019s the\
  \ only one who can catch a killer who\u2019s operating invisibly and in plain sight,\
  \ all at once.<br /><br />But her ability is also destroying her grip on reality\u2014\
  and as her past, present, and future collide, she finds herself confronting not\
  \ just the hotel\u2019s dark secrets but her own."
