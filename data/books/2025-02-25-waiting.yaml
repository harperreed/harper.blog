description: "In <i>Waiting,</i> PEN/Hemingway Award-winning author Ha Jin draws on\
  \ his intimate knowledge of contemporary China to create a novel of unexpected richness\
  \ and feeling. This is the story of Lin Kong, a man living in two worlds, struggling\
  \ with the conflicting claims of two utterly different women as he moves through\
  \ the political minefields of a society designed to regulate his every move and\
  \ stifle the promptings of his innermost heart. <br /><br />For more than seventeen\
  \ years, this devoted and ambitious doctor has been in love with an educated, clever,\
  \ modern woman, Manna Wu. But back in the traditional world of his home village\
  \ lives the wife his family chose for him when he was young\u2014a humble and touchingly\
  \ loyal woman, whom he visits in order to ask, again and again, for a divorce. In\
  \ a culture in which the ancient ties of tradition and family still hold sway and\
  \ where adultery discovered by the Party can ruin lives forever, Lin's passionate\
  \ love is stretched ever more taut by the passing years. Every summer, his compliant\
  \ wife agrees to a divorce but then backs out. This time, Lin promises, will be\
  \ different. <br /><br />Tracing these lives through their summer of decision and\
  \ beyond, Ha Jin vividly conjures the texture of daily life in a place where the\
  \ demands of human longing must contend with the weight of centuries of custom.\
  \ Waiting charms and startles us with its depiction of a China that remains hidden\
  \ to Western eyes even as it moves us with its piercing vision of the universal\
  \ complications of love."
