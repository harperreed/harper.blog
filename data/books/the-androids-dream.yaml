description: "A human diplomat creates an interstellar incident when he kills an alien\
  \ diplomat in a most\u2026unusual\u2026way. To avoid war, Earth's government must\
  \ find an equally unusual object: A type of sheep (\"The Android's Dream\"), used\
  \ in the alien race's coronation ceremony.<br /><br />To find the sheep, the government\
  \ turns to Harry Creek, ex-cop, war hero and hacker extraordinaire, who with the\
  \ help of Brian Javna, a childhood friend turned artificial intelligence, scours\
  \ the earth looking for the rare creature. And they find it, in the unknowing form\
  \ of Robin Baker, pet store owner, whose genes contain traces of the sheep DNA.<br\
  \ /><br />But there are others with plans for the sheep as well: Mercenaries employed\
  \ by the military. Adherents of a secret religion based on the writings of a 21st\
  \ century science fiction author. And alien races, eager to start a revolution on\
  \ their home world and a war on Earth.<br /><br />To keep our planet from being\
  \ enslaved, Harry will have to pull off the greatest diplomatic coup in history,\
  \ a grand gambit that will take him from the halls of power to the lava-strewn battlefields\
  \ of alien worlds. There's only one chance to get it right, to save the life of\
  \ Robin Baker -- and to protect the future of humanity."
