description: <div><b>The seventh novel in James S. A. Corey's <i>New York Times</i>
  bestselling Expanse series--now a major television series.</b><br /><br />AN OLD
  ENEMY RETURNS<br /><br />In the thousand-sun network of humanity's expansion, new
  colony worlds are struggling to find their way. Every new planet lives on a knife
  edge between collapse and wonder, and the crew of the aging gunship Rocinante have
  their hands more than full keeping the fragile peace.<br /><br />In the vast space
  between Earth and Jupiter, the inner planets and belt have formed a tentative and
  uncertain alliance still haunted by a history of wars and prejudices. On the lost
  colony world of Laconia, a hidden enemy has a new vision for all of humanity and
  the power to enforce it.<br /><br />New technologies clash with old as the history
  of human conflict returns to its ancient patterns of war and subjugation. But human
  nature is not the only enemy, and the forces being unleashed have their own price.
  A price that will change the shape of humanity -- and of the Rocinante -- unexpectedly
  and forever...</div>
