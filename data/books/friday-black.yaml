description: "<b>A piercingly raw debut story collection from a young writer with\
  \ an explosive voice; a treacherously surreal, and, at times, heartbreakingly satirical\
  \ look at what it\u2019s like to be young and black in America.</b><br /><br />\
  \ From the start of this extraordinary debut, Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah\u2019s writing\
  \ will grab you, haunt you, enrage and invigorate you. By placing ordinary characters\
  \ in extraordinary situations, Adjei-Brenyah reveals the violence, injustice, and\
  \ painful absurdities that black men and women contend with every day in this country.<br\
  \ /><br /> These stories tackle urgent instances of racism and cultural unrest,\
  \ and explore the many ways we fight for humanity in an unforgiving world. In \u201C\
  The Finkelstein Five,\u201D Adjei-Brenyah gives us an unforgettable reckoning of\
  \ the brutal prejudice of our justice system. In \u201CZimmer Land,\u201D we see\
  \ a far-too-easy-to-believe imagining of racism as sport. And \u201CFriday\_Black\u201D\
  \ and \u201CHow to Sell a Jacket as Told by Ice King\u201D show the horrors of consumerism\
  \ and the toll it takes on us all.<br /><br /> Entirely fresh in its style and perspective,\
  \ and sure to appeal to fans of Colson Whitehead, Marlon James, and George Saunders,\_\
  <i>Friday\_Black</i>\_confronts readers with a complicated, insistent, wrenching\
  \ chorus of emotions, the final note of which, remarkably, is hope."
