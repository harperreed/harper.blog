description: 'Exposed as the Second Dreamer, Araminta has become the target of a galaxywide
  search by government agent Paula Myo and the psychopath known as the Cat, along
  with others equally determined to prevent-- or facilitate --the pilgrimage of the
  Living Dream cult into the heart of the Void. An indestructible microuniverse, the
  Void may contain paradise, as the cultists believe, but it is also a deadly threat.
  For the miraculous reality that exists inside its boundaries demands energy--energy
  drawn from everything outside those boundaries: from planets, stars, galaxies...
  from everything that lives. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the parallel story of Edeard,
  the Waterwalker -- as told through a series of addictive dreams communicated to
  the gaiasphere via Inigo, the First Dreamer -- continues to unfold. But now the
  inspirational tale of this idealistic young man takes a darker and more troubling
  turn as he finds himself faced with powerful new enemies -- and temptations more
  powerful still. <br /><br />With time running out, a repentant Inigo must decide
  whether to release Edeard''s final dream: a dream whose message is scarcely less
  dangerous than the pilgrimage promises to be. And Araminta must choose whether to
  run from her unwanted responsibilities or face them down, with no guarantee of success
  or survival. But all these choices may be for naught if the monomaniacal Ilanthe,
  leader of the breakaway Accelerator Faction, is able to enter the Void. For it is
  not paradise she seeks there, but dominion.<br />'
