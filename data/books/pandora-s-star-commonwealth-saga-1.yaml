description: "The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some\
  \ four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected\
  \ by a web of transport \u201Ctunnels\u201D known as wormholes. At the farthest\
  \ edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over\
  \ one thousand light-years away, a star . . . vanishes. It does not go supernova.\
  \ It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply <i>disappears</i>. Since the\
  \ location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the\
  \ <i>Second Chance</i>, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it\
  \ represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA\
  \ pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him.<br /><br /> Opposed to the mission\
  \ are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated\
  \ by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians,\
  \ warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship\u2019s mission\
  \ for its own ends.<br /><br /> Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced\
  \ the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not\
  \ averted. Aboard the <i>Second Chance</i>, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated.\
  \ Soon enough, he will have other worries. A thousand light-years away, something\
  \ truly incredible is waiting: a deadly discovery whose unleashing will threaten\
  \ to destroy the Commonwealth . . . and humanity itself. <br /><br /><i>Could it\
  \ be that Johansson was right?</i>"
