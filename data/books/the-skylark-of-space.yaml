description: "Brilliant government scientist Richard Seaton discovers a remarkable\
  \ faster-than-light fuel that will power his interstellar spaceship, <i>The Skylark</i>.\
  \ His ruthless rival, Marc DuQuesne, and the sinister World Steel Corporation will\
  \ do anything to get their hands on the fuel. They kidnap Seaton's fianc\xE9e and\
  \ friends, unleashing a furious pursuit and igniting a burning desire for revenge\
  \ that will propel <i>The Skylark</i> across the galaxy and back.<br /><i></i>\_\
  <br /><i>The Skylark of Space</i> is the first and one of the best space operas\
  \ ever written. Breezy dialogue, romantic intrigue, fallible heroes, and complicated\
  \ villains infuse humanity and believability into a conflict of galactic proportions.\
  \ The <i>Amazing Stories</i> publication of <i>The Skylark of Space</i> in 1928\
  \ heralded the debut of a major new voice in American pulp science fiction and ushered\
  \ in its golden age. Legions of interstellar epics have been written since that\
  \ time, but none can match the wonder, dazzle, and sheer fun of the original. This\
  \ commemorative edition features the author's preferred version of the story, the\
  \ original illustrations by O. G. Estes Jr., and a new introduction by acclaimed\
  \ science fiction writer Vernor Vinge."
