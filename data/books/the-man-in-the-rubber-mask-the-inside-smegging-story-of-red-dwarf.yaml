description: "<p>It was 1989 when Robert Llewellyn first had his head encased in the\
  \ one-piece latex foam-rubber balaclava that is the head of Kryten in <i>Red Dwarf</i>\
  \ series three, and it gave him a distinctly funny turn.</p><p>\n  <br />\n</p><p><br\
  \ />Gazing at his own reflection and seeing the face of a mechanoid robot staring\
  \ back was surprisingly scary, not to mention uncomfortable and rather sweaty. And\
  \ he couldn't even eat his lunch.</p><p>\n  <br />\n</p><p><br />Since then, he\
  \ has sweated, frozen, been set on fire, exploded, spent thousands of hours in the\
  \ make-up chair and thousands more being taunted by Craig Charles for being a middle-class\
  \ b*****d. So it is a testament to the joyful camaraderie and life-enhancing silliness\
  \ of the world of <i>Red Dwarf</i> that twenty-three years later, Robert is still\
  \ willing to risk life, limb and hairline to don the rubber torture helmet for <i>Red\
  \ Dwarf X</i>, the recent triumphant return of the motley band of space bums.</p><p>\n\
  \  <br />\n</p><p><br />Originally published in 1993 after series six, <i>The Man\
  \ in the Rubber Mask</i> has now been completely updated with 43.7% extra smeg.</p>"
