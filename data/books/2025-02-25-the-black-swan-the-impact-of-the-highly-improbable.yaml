description: "The most influential book of the past seventy-five years: a groundbreaking\
  \ exploration of everything we know about what we don\u2019t know, now with a new\
  \ section called \u201COn Robustness and Fragility.\u201D<br /><br />A black swan\
  \ is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable;\
  \ it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that\
  \ makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing\
  \ success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black\
  \ swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to\
  \ events in our own personal lives.<br /> <br />Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon\
  \ of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb,\
  \ is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on\
  \ generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again\
  \ fail to take into consideration what we don\u2019t know. We are, therefore, unable\
  \ to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate,\
  \ and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the \u201C\
  impossible.\u201D<br /> <br />For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves\
  \ into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the\
  \ irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and\
  \ shape our world. In this revelatory book, Taleb will change the way you look at\
  \ the world, and this second edition features a new philosophical and empirical\
  \ essay, \u201COn Robustness and Fragility,\u201D which offers tools to navigate\
  \ and exploit a Black Swan world.<br /><br />Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer,\
  \ with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command\
  \ of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory.\
  \ Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, The Black Swan is a landmark\
  \ book\u2014itself a black swan."
