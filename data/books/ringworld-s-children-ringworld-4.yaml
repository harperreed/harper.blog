description: 'Welcome to a world like no other.<br /><br />The Ringworld: a landmark
  engineering achievement, a flat band 3 million times the surface area of Earth,
  encircling a distant star. Home to trillions of inhabitants, not all of which are
  human, and host to amazing technological wonders, the Ringworld is unique in all
  of the universe.<br /><br />Explorer Louis Wu, an Earth-born human who was part
  of the first expedition to Ringworld, becomes enmeshed in interplanetary and interspecies
  intrigue as war, and a powerful new weapon, threaten to tear the Ringworld apart
  forever. Now, the future of Ringworld lies in the actions of its children: Tunesmith,
  the Ghoul protector; Acolyte, the exiled son of Speaker-to-Animals, and Wembleth,
  a strange Ringworld native with a mysterious past. All must play a dangerous game
  in order to save Ringworld''s population, and the stability of Ringworld itself.<br
  /><br />Blending awe-inspiring science with non-stop action and fun, <i>Ringworld''s
  Children</i>, the fourth installment of the multiple award-winning saga, is the
  perfect introduction for readers new to this New York Times bestselling series,
  and long-time fans of Larry Niven''s Ringworld.'
