description: "When renegade author Kameron Hurley (<em>The Light Brigade</em>; <em>The\
  \ Stars Are Legion</em>) takes you to the future, be prepared for the unexpected.\
  \ Yes, it will be dangerous, frequently brutal, and often devastating. But it\u2019\
  s also savagely funny, deliriously strange, and absolutely brimming with adventure.<br\
  \ /><br />In these edgy, unexpected tales, a body-hopping mercenary avenges his\
  \ pet elephant, and an orphan falls in love with a sentient starship. Fighters ally\
  \ to power a reality-bending engine, and a swamp-dwelling introvert tries to save\
  \ the world\u2014from her plague-casting former wife.<br /><br />So come meet Kameron\
  \ Hurley in the future. The version she's created here is weirder\u2014and far more\
  \ hopeful\u2014than you could ever imagine."
