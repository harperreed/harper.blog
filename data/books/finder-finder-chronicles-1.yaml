description: '<b>From Hugo Award-winning debut author Suzanne Palmer comes an action-packed
  sci-fi caper starring Fergus Ferguson, interstellar repo man and professional finder.</b><br
  /><br />Fergus Ferguson has been called a lot of names: thief, con artist, repo
  man. He prefers the term <i>finder</i>.<br /><br />His latest job should be simple.
  Find the spacecraft <i>Venetia''s Sword</i> and steal it back from Arum Gilger,
  ex-nobleman turned power-hungry trade boss. He''ll slip in, decode the ship''s compromised
  AI security, and get out of town, <i>Sword</i> in hand.<br /><br />Fergus locates
  both Gilger and the ship in the farthest corner of human-inhabited space, a gas-giant-harvesting
  colony called Cernee. But Fergus'' arrival at the colony is anything but simple.
  A cable car explosion launches Cernee into civil war, and Fergus must ally with
  Gilger''s enemies to navigate a field of space mines and a small army of hostile
  mercenaries. What was supposed to be a routine job evolves into negotiating a power
  struggle between factions. Even worse, Fergus has become increasingly--and inconveniently--invested
  in the lives of the locals.<br /><br />It doesn''t help that a dangerous alien species
  thought mythical prove unsettlingly real, and their ominous triangle ships keep
  following Fergus around.<br /><br />Foolhardy. Eccentric. Reckless. Whatever he''s
  called, Fergus will need all the help he can get to take back the <i>Sword </i>and
  maybe save Cernee from destruction in the process.'
