description: "<b>Conspiracies abound in this surreal and yet all-too-real technothriller\
  \ in which a deadly underground alternate reality game might just be altering reality\
  \ itself, set in the same world as the popular <i>Rabbits</i> podcast.</b> <br /><br\
  \ />It's an average work day. You've been wrapped up in a task, and you check the\
  \ clock when you come up for air\u20144:44 pm. You go to check your email, and 44\
  \ unread messages have built up. With a shock, you realize it is April 4th\u2014\
  4/4. And when you get in your car to drive home, your odometer reads 44,444. Coincidence?\
  \ Or have you just seen the edge of a rabbit hole? <br /><br />Rabbits is a mysterious\
  \ alternate reality game so vast it uses our global reality as its canvas. Since\
  \ the game first started in 1959, ten iterations have appeared and nine winners\
  \ have been declared. Their identities are unknown. So is their reward, which is\
  \ whispered to be NSA or CIA recruitment, vast wealth, immortality, or perhaps even\
  \ the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe itself. But the deeper you get,\
  \ the more deadly the game becomes. Players have died in the past\u2014and the body\
  \ count is rising. <br /><br />And now the eleventh round is about to begin. Enter\
  \ K\u2014a Rabbits obsessive who has been trying to find a way into the game for\
  \ years. That path opens when K is approached by billionaire Alan Scarpio, the alleged\
  \ winner of the sixth iteration. Scarpio says that something has gone wrong with\
  \ the game and that K needs to fix it before Eleven starts or the whole world will\
  \ pay the price. <br /><br />Five days later, Scarpio is declared missing. Two weeks\
  \ after that, K blows the deadline and Eleven begins. And suddenly, the fate of\
  \ the entire universe is at stake."
