description: "<b>In <i>Ink and Bone</i>, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author\
  \ Rachel Caine introduced a world where knowledge is power, and power corrupts absolutely.\
  \ Now, she continues the story of those who dare to defy the Great Library\u2014\
  and rewrite history... </b><br /><b>\_</b><br /> With an iron fist, The Great Library\
  \ controls the knowledge of the world, ruthlessly stamping out all rebellion, forbidding\
  \ the personal ownership of books in the name of the greater good.<br /><b>\_</b><br\
  \ /> Jess Brightwell has survived his introduction to the sinister, seductive world\
  \ of the Library, but serving in its army is nothing like he envisioned. His life\
  \ and the lives of those he cares for have been altered forever. His best friend\
  \ is lost, and Morgan, the girl he loves, is locked away in the Iron Tower and doomed\
  \ to a life apart.<br /> \_<br /> Embarking on a mission to save one of their own,\
  \ Jess and his band of allies make one wrong move and suddenly find themselves hunted\
  \ by the Library\u2019s deadly automata and forced to flee Alexandria, all the way\
  \ to London.<br /> \_<br /> But Jess\u2019s home isn't safe anymore. The Welsh army\
  \ is coming, London is burning, and soon, Jess must choose between his friends,\
  \ his family, or the Library willing to sacrifice anything and anyone in the search\
  \ for ultimate control..."
