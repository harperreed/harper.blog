description: Annabel Scheme is a detective story set in an alternate San Francisco
  where the digital and the occult live side-by-side. It's a short, snappy read --
  about 128 pages/128,000 Kindle locations -- and perfect for people who like Sherlock
  Holmes, Douglas Adams, ghosts and/or the internet. Finally, it makes a great Kindle
  gift. In Scheme's San Francisco, an indie rocker's new tracks are climbing the charts,
  even though the rocker herself is long dead. A devout gamer has gone missing, and
  the only trace of him that remains is inside his favorite game, the blockbuster
  MMORPG called World of Jesus. And the richest man in the city, the inventor of the
  search engine called Grail, might just have made a deal with a devil. Meanwhile,
  Annabel Scheme has just hired herself a Watson, an A.I. assistant who's now learning
  the ropes on a case that will quickly transform into Scheme's biggest -- and possibly
  her last.<br /><br />Come on. Fog City is waiting.
