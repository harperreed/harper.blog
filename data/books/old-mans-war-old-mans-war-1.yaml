description: "John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his\
  \ wife's grave. Then he joined the army.<br /><br />The good news is that humanity\
  \ finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live\
  \ on are scarce\u2014and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So:\
  \ we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate.\
  \ Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.<br\
  \ /><br />Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the\
  \ hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement\
  \ age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who\
  \ carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth\
  \ and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive,\
  \ you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won\
  \ colony planets.<br /><br />John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest\
  \ idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far,\
  \ far harder than he can imagine\u2014and what he will become is far stranger."
