description: Taran wanted to be a hero, and looking after a pig wasn't exactly heroic,
  even though Hen Wen was an oracular pig. But the day that Hen Wen vanished, Taran
  was led into an enchanting and perilous world. With his band of followers, he confronted
  the Horned King and his terrible Cauldron-Born. These were the forces of evil, and
  only Hen Wen knew the secret of keeping the kingdom of Prydain safe from them. But
  who would find her first?

      description: "The Chronicles of Prydain, based on Welsh mythology, have become\
        \ the standard of excellence in fantasy literature for children. Since <i>The\
        \ Book of Three</i> was first published in 1964, young readers have been enthralled\
        \ by the adventures of Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper and his quest to become\
        \ a hero. Taran is joined by an engaging cast of characters that includes\
        \ Eilonwy, the strong-willed and sharp-tongued princess; Fflewddur Fflam,\
        \ the hyperbole-prone bard; the ever-faithful Gurgi; and the curmudgeonly\
        \ Doli\u2014all of whom become involved in an epic struggle between good and\
        \ evil that shapes the fate of the legendary land of Prydain.\n    \n    The\
        \ Black Cauldron was a Newbery Honor Book, and The High King won the Newbery\
        \ Medal for \u201Cthe most distinguished contribution to American literature\
        \ for children.\u201D\n    \n    --from <a href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/series/TheChroniclesofPrydain\"\
        >the Macmillan publisher's website</a>\n    \n    In addition to the five\
        \ books of the series, there are a book of short stories and several related\
        \ picture books.\n    \n    This series is also known as:\n    * The Prydain\
