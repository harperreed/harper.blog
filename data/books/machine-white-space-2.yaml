description: "<b>In this compelling and addictive novel set in the same universe as\
  \ the critically acclaimed White Space series and perfect for fans of Karen Traviss\
  \ and Ada Hoffman, a space station begins to unravel when a routine search and rescue\
  \ mission returns after going dangerously awry. </b><br /><br />Meet Doctor Jens.<br\
  \ /> <br />She hasn\u2019t had a decent cup of coffee in fifteen years. Her workday\
  \ begins when she jumps out of perfectly good space ships and continues with developing\
  \ treatments for sick alien species she\u2019s never seen before. She loves her\
  \ life. Even without the coffee.<br /> <br />But Dr. Jens is about to discover an\
  \ astonishing mystery: two ships, one ancient and one new, locked in a deadly embrace.\
  \ The crew is suffering from an unknown ailment and the shipmind is trapped in an\
  \ inadequate body, much of her memory pared away.<br /> <br />Unfortunately, Dr.\
  \ Jens can\u2019t resist a mystery and she begins doing some digging. She has no\
  \ idea that she\u2019s about to discover horrifying and life-changing truths.<br\
  \ /> <br />Written in Elizabeth Bear\u2019s signature \u201Crollicking, suspenseful,\
  \ and sentimental\u201D (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) style, <i>Machine</i> is a fresh\
  \ and electrifying space opera that you won\u2019t be able to put down."
