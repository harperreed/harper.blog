description: "Candace Chen, a millennial living in NY, is devoted to routine. With\
  \ the recent passing of her Chinese immigrant parents, she\u2019s had her fill of\
  \ uncertainty. She\u2019s content just to carry on. So Candace barely notices when\
  \ a plague of biblical proportions sweeps New York. Then Shen Fever spreads. <br\
  \ /><br />Her bosses enlist her as part of a dwindling skeleton crew with a big\
  \ end-date payoff. Soon entirely alone, she becomes the anonymous blogger NY Ghost.<br\
  \ /><br /> Enter a group of survivors, led by IT tech Bob. They\u2019re traveling\
  \ to a place called the Facility, where, Bob promises, they will have everything\
  \ they need to start society anew. Should Candace trust Bob?"
