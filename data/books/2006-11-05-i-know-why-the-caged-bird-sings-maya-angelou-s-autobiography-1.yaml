description: "Maya Angelou\u2019s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved\
  \ worldwide. Her life story is told in the documentary film And Still I Rise, as\
  \ seen on PBS\u2019s American Masters.<br /><br />Here is a book as joyous and painful,\
  \ as mysterious and memorable, as childhood itself. I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\
  \ captures the longing of lonely children, the brute insult of bigotry, and the\
  \ wonder of words that can make the world right. Maya Angelou\u2019s debut memoir\
  \ is a modern American classic beloved worldwide.<br /> <br />Sent by their mother\
  \ to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town,\
  \ Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice\
  \ of the local \u201Cpowhitetrash.\u201D At eight years old and back at her mother\u2019\
  s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age\u2014and has to\
  \ live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya\
  \ learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and\
  \ the ideas of great authors (\u201CI met and fell in love with William Shakespeare\u201D\
