description: 'The short story, <i>Franny</i>, takes place in an unnamed college town
  and tells the tale of an undergraduate who is becoming disenchanted with the selfishness
  and inauthenticity she perceives all around her.<br /><br />The novella, <i>Zooey</i>,
  is named for Zooey Glass, the second-youngest member of the Glass family. As his
  younger sister, Franny, suffers a spiritual and existential breakdown in her parents''
  Manhattan living room -- leaving Bessie, her mother, deeply concerned -- Zooey comes
  to her aid, offering what he thinks is brotherly love, understanding, and words
  of sage advice.<br /><br />Salinger writes of these works: <i>"FRANNY came out in
  The New Yorker in 1955, and was swiftly followed, in 1957 by ZOOEY. Both stories
  are early, critical entries in a narrative series I''m doing about a family of settlers
  in twentieth-century New York, the Glasses. It is a long-term project, patently
  an ambiguous one, and there is a real-enough danger, I suppose that sooner or later
  I''ll bog down, perhaps disappear entirely, in my own methods, locutions, and mannerisms.
  On the whole, though, I''m very hopeful. I love working on these Glass stories,
  I''ve been waiting for them most of my life, and I think I have fairly decent, monomaniacal
  plans to finish them with due care and all-available skill."</i><br />'
