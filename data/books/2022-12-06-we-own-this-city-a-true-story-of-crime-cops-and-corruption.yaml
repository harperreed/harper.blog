description: '<b>The astonishing true story of "one of the most startling police corruption
  scandals in a generation" (<i>New York Times</i>), from the Pulitzer Prize-nominated
  reporter who exposed a gang of criminal cops and their years-long plunder of Baltimore.</b><br
  /><br />Baltimore, 2015. Riots were erupting across the city as citizens demanded
  justice for Freddie Gray, a twenty-five-year old black man who had died while in
  police custody. At the same time, drug and violent crime were surging, and that
  year, Baltimore would reach its deadliest year in over two decades: 342 homicides
  in a city of six hundred thousand people. Under intense scrutiny--and a federal
  investigation over Gray''s death--the Baltimore police department turned to a rank-and-file
  hero, Sergeant Wayne Jenkins, and his elite unit, the Gun Trace Task Force, to help
  get guns and drugs off the street.<br /><br />And yet, despite intense scrutiny,
  what <i>The New York Times</i> would call "one of the most startling police corruption
  scandals in a generation" was unfolding. Entrusted with fixing the city''s drug
  crisis, Jenkins and his posse of corrupt cops were instead stealing from its citizens--skimming
  from the drug busts they made, pocketing thousands in cash found in private homes,
  and planting fake evidence to throw Internal Affairs off their scent. Their brazen
  crime spree would go unchecked for years, and would result in countless wrongful
  convictions, the death of an innocent person--and the mysterious death of one cop
  who was shot in the head the day before he was scheduled to testify against the
  Force.<br /><br />Award-winning investigative journalist Justin Fenton has been
  relentlessly exposing the scandal since 2017, conducting hundreds of interviews
  and poring over thousands of court documents. The result is an astounding feat of
  reportage about a rogue police unit, and the American city they held hostage.'
