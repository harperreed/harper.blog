description: "With <i>Life Ceremony</i>, the incomparable Sayaka Murata is back with\
  \ her first collection of short stories ever to be translated into English. In Japan,\
  \ Murata is particularly admired for her short stories, which are sometimes sweet,\
  \ sometimes shocking, and always imbued with an otherworldly imagination and uncanniness.<br\
  \ /><br />In these twelve stories, Murata mixes an unusual cocktail of humor and\
  \ horror to portray both the loners and outcasts as well as turning the norms and\
  \ traditions of society on their head to better question them. Whether the stories\
  \ take place in modern-day Japan, the future, or an alternate reality is left to\
  \ the reader\u2019s interpretation, as the characters often seem strange in their\
  \ normality in a frighteningly abnormal world. In \u201CA First-Rate Material\u201D\
  , Nana and Naoki are happily engaged, but Naoki can\u2019t stand the conventional\
  \ use of deceased people\u2019s bodies for clothing, accessories, and furniture,\
  \ and a disagreement around this threatens to derail their perfect wedding day.\
  \ \u201CLovers on the Breeze\u201D is told from the perspective of a curtain in\
  \ a child\u2019s bedroom that jealously watches the young girl Naoko as she has\
  \ her first kiss with a boy from her class and does its best to stop her. \u201C\
  Eating the City\u201D explores the strange norms around food and foraging, while\
  \ \u201CHatchling\u201D closes the collection with an extraordinary depiction of\
  \ the fractured personality of someone who tries too hard to fit in.<br /><br />In\
  \ these strange and wonderful stories of family and friendship, sex and intimacy,\
  \ belonging and individuality, Murata asks above all what it means to be a human\
  \ in our world and offers answers that surprise and linger."
