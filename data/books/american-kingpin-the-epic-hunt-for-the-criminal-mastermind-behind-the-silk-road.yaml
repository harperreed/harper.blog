description: "From <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author Nick Bilton comes a true-life\
  \ thriller about the rise and fall of Ross Ulbricht, aka the Dread Pirate Roberts,\
  \ the founder of the online black market Silk Road.<br /> \_<br /> \_\_\_\_ In <i>Hatching\
  \ Twitter</i>, Nick Bilton gave readers an astonishingly reported, riveting, and\
  \ impeccably crafted story of the politics and power struggles behind the founding\
  \ of Twitter. Now Bilton turns his investigative journalism to the story of Ross\
  \ Ulbricht, the notorious and enigmatic founder of a drug empire called Silk Road.<br\
  \ /> \_<br /> \_\_\_\_ In 2011, Ulbricht, a 26-year-old libertarian idealist and\
  \ former Boy Scout, launched \"a website where people could buy anything anonymously,\
  \ with no trail whatsoever that could lead back to them.\" He called it Silk Road,\
  \ opened for business on the Dark Web, and christened himself the Dread Pirate Roberts\
  \ (after the <i>Princess Bride</i> character). The site grew at a tremendous pace,\
  \ quickly becoming a $1.2 billion enterprise where you could buy or sell drugs,\
  \ hacking software, forged passports, counterfeit cash, guns, grenades, and poisons.<br\
  \ /> \_<br /> \_\_\_\_ The Silk Road soon caught the attention of the Feds, who\
  \ embarked on an epic two-year manhunt for the site's proprietor. Ulbricht, in the\
  \ meantime, struggled to maintain control of his double life and his marketplace,\
  \ which he originally started to prove that legalizing drugs could make society\
  \ safer. He gradually abandoned his libertarian ideals to rule Silk Road with increasingly\
  \ authoritarian force. At one point, he engaged the services of hired hit men to\
  \ take out employees he felt had wronged him. Soon, some of the Federal agents who\
  \ were supposed to be hunting for Ulbricht were lured into the dark world and switched\
  \ sides to join him.<br /> \_<br /> \_\_\_\_ This is a true-life thriller about\
  \ ambition gone awry, spurred on by the defining clash of our time: the new world\
  \ of libertarian-leaning, anonymous, decentralized web advocates and the old world\
  \ of government control, order, and the rule of law. Bilton's dazzling rendering\
  \ and gift for narrative make for an endlessly fascinating drama.<br /><br /><br\
  \ /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"
