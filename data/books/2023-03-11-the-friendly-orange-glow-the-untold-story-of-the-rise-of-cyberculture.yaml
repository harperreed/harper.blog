description: 'The remarkable untold story of PLATO, the computer program and platform
  created in the 1960s, that marked the true beginning of cyberculture--a book that
  will rewrite the history of computing and the Internet<br /><br />Here is the story
  of the brilliant, eccentric designers, developers, and denizens (often teenagers
  and twentysomethings) of the PLATO system, a computer network so far ahead of its
  time, and with a list of hardware and software innovations so long, that it''s almost
  inconceivable that it actually existed--and existed so long ago--only to fade almost
  entirely from public view. The many thousands of people who used the system have
  held on to the PLATO ideas throughout their careers, influencing countless technological
  products and programs: from flat-panel wall TVs and touch-sensitive screens to chat
  rooms, instant messaging, screen savers, multiplayer games, flight simulators, crowdsourcing,
  interactive fiction, emoticons, and e-learning. Fascinating, first hand, and revelatory,
  The Friendly Orange Glow makes clear that the work of PLATO practitioners has profoundly
  shaped the computer industry from its inception to our very moment. <br /><br />This
  book is as much the biography of a vision as it is the story of the people behind
  PLATO. Every technology story--whether it''s about the steam engine, airplane, telephone,
  Model T, or more recently, Apple, Google, and Tesla electric car--has at its core
  a vision. It is the immutable nature of technology, and technology visions, to run
  full life cycles, from cradle to grave. PLATO''s story is no different. Like all
  technology visions, PLATO grew outdated and was disrupted by competing visions.
  The Friendly Orange Glow is a revelatory paradigm for our technological age.'
