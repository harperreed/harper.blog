description: "<strong>THE INSTANT <em>NEW YORK TIMES</em> BESTSELLER</strong><br /><br\
  \ /><strong>The alternate history first contact adventure <em>Axiom's End</em> is\
  \ an extraordinary debut from Hugo finalist and video essayist Lindsay Ellis.</strong><br\
  \ /><br /><strong>Truth is a human right.</strong><br /><br />It\u2019s fall 2007.\
  \ A well-timed leak has revealed that the US government might have engaged in first\
  \ contact. Cora Sabino is doing everything she can to avoid the whole mess, since\
  \ the force driving the controversy is her whistleblower father. Even though Cora\
  \ hasn\u2019t spoken to him in years, his celebrity has caught the attention of\
  \ the press, the Internet, the paparazzi, and the government\u2014and with him in\
  \ hiding, that attention is on her. She neither knows nor cares whether her father\u2019\
  s leaks are a hoax, and wants nothing to do with him\u2014until she learns just\
  \ how deeply entrenched her family is in the cover-up, and that an extraterrestrial\
  \ presence has been on Earth for decades.<br /><br />Realizing the extent to which\
  \ both she and the public have been lied to, she sets out to gather as much information\
  \ as she can, and finds that the best way for her to uncover the truth is not as\
  \ a whistleblower, but as an intermediary. The alien presence has been completely\
  \ uncommunicative until she convinces one of them that she can act as their interpreter,\
  \ becoming the first and only human vessel of communication. Their otherworldly\
  \ connection will change everything she thought she knew about being human\u2014\
  and could unleash a force more sinister than she ever imagined."
