description: "<i>Venus on the Half-Shell</i> is a science fiction novel attributed\
  \ to the fictional author Kilgore Trout but actually written by Philip Jos\xE9 Farmer.\
  \ Trout is a recurring character of many of the novels of Kurt Vonnegut. This book\
  \ was first mentioned as a fictional work in <i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i>\
  \ ('65). Farmer's novel was 1st published in two parts beginning in the December,\
  \ 1974 issue of <i>The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</i>.<br /><br />According\
  \ to Farmer's introduction in <i>Venus on the Half-Shell and Others</i>, Vonnegut\
  \ was initially reluctant to allow the project, but finally relented. After publication,\
  \ a poorly-worded magazine article gave Vonnegut the impression that Farmer had\
  \ planned to write the story regardless of his permission, which angered Vonnegut.\
  \ Also, it was popularly assumed that Vonnegut wrote the book. This problem was\
  \ solved by the book being reprinted under Farmer's by-line.<br /><br />A common\
  \ element to this novel is the origin of many of the characters' and locations'\
  \ names. Farmer \"put in a lot of references to literature and fictional authors...\
  \ Most of the alien names in Venus were formed by transposing the letters of English\
  \ or non-English words.\"<br /><br />The title and paperback cover art are a reference\
  \ to an Italian Renaissance fresco by Sandro Botticelli, <i>The Birth of Venus</i>,\
  \ which depicts the birth of the goddess Venus as her rising from the sea on a clam\
  \ shell."
