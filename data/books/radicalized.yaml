description: "Here are four urgent stories from author and activist Cory Doctorow,\
  \ four social, technological and economic visions of the world today and its near\u2014\
  all too near\u2014future.<br /><br />'Unauthorized Bread' is a tale of immigration,\
  \ toxic economic stratification and a young woman's perilously illegal quest to\
  \ fix a broken toaster.<br /><br />In 'Model Minority' a superhero finds himself\
  \ way out his depth when he confronts the corruption of the police and justice system.<br\
  \ /><br />'Radicalized' is the story of a desperate husband, a darknet forum and\
  \ the birth of a violent uprising against the US health care system.<br /><br />The\
  \ final story, 'The Masque of the Red Death', tracks an uber-wealthy survivalist\
  \ and his followers as they hole up and attempt to ride out the collapse of society."
