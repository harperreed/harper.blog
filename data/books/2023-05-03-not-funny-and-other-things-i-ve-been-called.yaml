description: "For fans of the perceptive comedy of Hannah Gadsby, Lindy West, and\
  \ Sarah Silverman, Academy Award\u2013nominated and acclaimed stand-up comedian\
  \ Jena Friedman presents a witty and insightful collection of essays on the cultural\
  \ flashpoints of today.<br /><br />Growing up, Jena Friedman didn\u2019t care about\
  \ being likable. And she never wanted to be a comedian, either. A child of the 90s,\
  \ she wouldn\u2019t discover her knack for the funny business until research for\
  \ her college thesis led her to take an improv class in Chicago.<br /><br />That\
  \ anthropology paper, written on race, class, and gender in the city\u2019s comedy\
  \ scene, was, in Jena\u2019s own words, \u201Cjust as funny as it sounds.\u201D\
  \ But it did lay the groundwork for a career that has seen her write and produce\
  \ for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , the Late Show with David Letterman , and\
  \ the Oscar nominated Borat Subsequent Moviefilm .<br /><br />Friedman\u2019s debut\
  \ collection, Not Funny , takes on the third rails of modern life in Jena\u2019\
  s bold and subversive style, with essays that explore cancel culture, sexism, work,\
  \ celebrity worship, and\u2026dead baby jokes.<br /><br />In a moment where women\u2019\
  s rights are being rolled back, fascism is on the rise, and so many of us could\
  \ use a breather as we struggle to get by, Jena applies her unique gifts to pull\
  \ a laugh from things deemed too raw, too precious, and too scary to joke about.\
  \ She shares her stories of taking on those who told her she was too brash, too\
  \ edgy, and too \u201Cunlikable\u201D to make it. She deftly dissects how we get\
  \ coerced into silence on the issues that matter most, until they\u2019ve gone too\
  \ far afield to be turned back around again. And she shares her struggles to make\
  \ it (-ish) in a world that, more often than not, would rather tune out than listen\
  \ to a woman confronting the indignities we\u2019ve been told to bear."
