description: Private Detective Cormoran Strike is visiting his family in Cornwall
  when he is approached by a woman asking for help finding her mother, Margot Bamborough
  - who went missing in mysterious circumstances in 1974.<br /><br />Strike has never
  tackled a cold case before, let alone one forty years old. But despite the slim
  chance of success, he is intrigued and takes it on; adding to the long list of cases
  that he and his partner in the agency, Robin Ellacott, are currently working on.
  And Robin herself is also juggling a messy divorce and unwanted male attention,
  as well as battling her own feelings about Strike.<br /><br />As Strike and Robin
  investigate Margot's disappearance, they come up against a fiendishly complex case
  with leads that include tarot cards, a psychopathic serial killer and witnesses
  who cannot all be trusted. And they learn that even cases decades old can prove
  to be deadly . . .<br /><br />A breathtaking, labyrinthine epic, Troubled Blood
  is the fifth Strike and Robin novel and the most gripping and satisfying yet.
