description: "<b>A real-life technological thriller about a band of eccentric misfits\
  \ taking on the biggest cybersecurity threats of our time.</b><br /><br />Scattered\
  \ across the world, an elite team of code-cracking techies is working tirelessly\
  \ on your behalf to thwart the most notorious cyber scourge of our time. You\u2019\
  ve probably never heard of them. But if you work for a school, a business, a hospital,\
  \ or a municipal government, especially if its cybersecurity is imperfect, chances\
  \ are that you\u2019re painfully familiar with the group\u2019s sworn ransomware.\
  \ Again and again, these ordinary people, mostly self-taught and often struggling\
  \ to make ends meet, have outwitted the shadowy networks of hackers and criminal\
  \ gangs that lock computer networks and extort huge payments in return for the key.<br\
  \ /><br /><i>The Ransomware Hunting Team</i> is the incredible true story of a band\
  \ of misfits who have used their extraordinary skills to save millions of ransomware\
  \ victims from paying billions of dollars to criminals. Working in their free time\
  \ from bedrooms and back offices, they offer their services pro bono to those whom\
  \ the FBI, other government agencies, and the private sector are unwilling or unable\
  \ to help. This book follows the teammates as they respond to dire calls for help\u2014\
  and tracks the ups and downs of their work as they race to rescue precious files\
  \ and communicate directly with their adversaries. Urgent, uplifting, and entertaining,\
  \ Renee Dudley and Daniel Golden\u2019s <i>The Ransomware Hunting Team</i> is a\
  \ real-life technological thriller set in a dangerous new era of cybercrime."
