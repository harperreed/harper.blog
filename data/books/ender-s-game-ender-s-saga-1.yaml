description: 'Andrew "Ender" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games;
  he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation,
  Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien
  enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender
  into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy
  him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br
  /><br />But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers
  has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been
  underway almost as long. Ender''s two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every
  bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably
  violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither
  was found suitable for the military''s purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy
  of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political
  process, to become a ruler. Valentine''s abilities turn more toward the subtle control
  of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays.
  Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks,
  these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has
  no future at all if their brother Ender fails.<br /><br />Source: hatrack.com'

      description: "\n\n    The Ender's Game series (also known as the \"Ender Quintet\"\
        ) is sometimes called Enderverse or the Ender Saga. It is a series of science\
        \ fiction books by Orson Scott Card. The series started with the novelette\
        \ \"Ender's Game\", which was later expanded into the novel Ender's Game.\
        \ It currently consists of eleven novels and ten short stories. The first\
        \ two novels in the series, Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, each won\
        \ both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and were among the most influential science\
        \ fiction novels of the 1980s.\r\n    \r\n    Also See <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/40409-ender-s-shadow\"\
