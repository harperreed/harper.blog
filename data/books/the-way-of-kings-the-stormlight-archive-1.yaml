description: <i>I long for the days before the Last Desolation.<br /><br />The age
  before the Heralds abandoned us and the Knights Radiant turned against us. A time
  when there was still magic in the world and honor in the hearts of men.<br /><br
  />The world became ours, and yet we lost it. Victory proved to be the greatest test
  of all. Or was that victory illusory? Did our enemies come to recognize that the
  harder they fought, the fiercer our resistance? Fire and hammer will forge steel
  into a weapon, but if you abandon your sword, it eventually rusts away.<br /><br
  />There are four whom we watch. The first is the surgeon, forced to forsake healing
  to fight in the most brutal war of our time. The second is the assassin, a murderer
  who weeps as he kills. The third is the liar, a young woman who wears a scholar's
  mantle over the heart of a thief. The last is the prince, a warlord whose eyes have
  opened to the ancient past as his thirst for battle wanes.<br /><br />The world
  can change. Surgebinding and Shardwielding can return; the magics of ancient days
  become ours again. These four people are key.<br /><br />One of them may redeem
  us. And one of them will destroy us.</i><br /><br />From Brandon Sanderson-who completed
  Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time-comes The Stormlight Archive, an ambitious new
  fantasy epic in a unique, richly imagined setting. Roshar is a world relentlessly
  blasted by awesome tempests, where emotions take on physical form, and terrible
  secrets hide deep beneath the rocky landscape.<br /><br /><i>Speak again the ancient
  oaths</i><br /><b>Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination.</b><br
  /><i>and return to men the Shards they once bore. The Knights Radiant must stand
  again!</i>

      description: "\n\n    Brandon Sanderson's epic fantasy cycle tells the story\
        \ of Roshar, a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power\
        \ sweep across the rocky terrain. It has been centuries since the fall of\
        \ the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades\
        \ and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform\
        \ ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. As brutal wars rage over the\
        \ control of these magical weapons, an ancient text called The Way of Kings\
        \ tells of ancient times, the Knights Radiant, and perhaps the true cause\
        \ of the war. The Knights Radiant must stand again.\r\n    \r\n    https://us.macmillan.com/series/thestormlightarchive\r\
        \n    \r\n    #0.5, <I>The Way of Kings Prime</I>, was written in 2002 and\
        \ is basically an alternate version of <I>The Way of Kings</I>, which was\
        \ published by Tor Books in 2010. <I>The Way of Kings Prime</I> is very different\
        \ from the published book. Think of it as set in a different universe with\
        \ a completely different plot. <B>If you haven\u2019t read the 2010 canonical\
        \ version, please read that one first.</B> -- from author's website (emphasis\
        \ mine)\r\n    \r\n    One novel set in this world is the short story \"Rysn\"\
        \ from the anthology Epic - Legends of Fantasy. \r\n    \r\n    The Stormlight\
        \ Archive series will have 10 books: first five books will form first part\
        \ sequence, while other five books will form the second part of the series.\r\
