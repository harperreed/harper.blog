description: "When critics attacked Andy Warhol's Marilyn paintings as shallow, the\
  \ Pop artist was happy to present himself as shallower still: He claimed that he\
  \ silkscreened to avoid the hard work of painting, although he was actually a meticulous\
  \ workaholic; in interviews he presented himself as a silly na\xEFf when in private\
  \ he was the canniest of sophisticates. Blake Gopnik's definitive biography digs\
  \ deep into the contradictions and radical genius that led Andy Warhol to revolutionise\
  \ our cultural world.<p>Based on years of archival research and on interviews with\
  \ hundreds of Warhol's surviving friends, lovers and enemies, <i>Warhol </i>traces\
  \ the artist's path from his origins as the impoverished son of Eastern European\
  \ immigrants in 1930s Pittsburgh, through his early success as a commercial illustrator\
  \ and his groundbreaking pivot into fine art, to the society portraiture and popular\
  \ celebrity of the '70s and '80s, as he reflected and responded to the changing\
  \ dynamics of commerce and culture.</p><p>Warhol sought out all the most glamorous\
  \ figures of his times - Susan Sontag, Mick Jagger, the Barons de Rothschild - despite\
  \ being burdened with an almost crippling shyness. Behind the public glitter of\
  \ the artist's Factory, with its superstars, drag queens and socialites, there was\
  \ a man who lived with his mother for much of his life and guarded the privacy of\
  \ his home. He overcame the vicious homophobia of his youth to become a symbol of\
  \ gay achievement, while always seeking the pleasures of traditional romance and\
  \ coupledom. (<i>Warhol</i> explodes the myth of his asexuality.)</p><p>Filled with\
  \ new insights into the artist's work and personality, <i>Warhol</i> asks: Was he\
  \ a joke or a genius, a radical or a social climber? As Warhol himself would have\
  \ answered: Yes.</p>"
