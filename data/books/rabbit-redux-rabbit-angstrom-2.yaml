description: "In this sequel to <i>Rabbit, Run,</i> John Updike resumes the spiritual\
  \ quest of his anxious Everyman, Harry \u201CRabbit\u201D Angstrom. Ten years have\
  \ passed; the impulsive former athlete has become a paunchy thirty-six-year-old\
  \ conservative, and Eisenhower\u2019s becalmed America has become 1969\u2019s lurid\
  \ turmoil of technology, fantasy, drugs, and violence. Rabbit is abandoned by his\
  \ family, his home invaded by a runaway and a radical, his past reduced to a ruined\
  \ inner landscape; still he clings to semblances of decency and responsibility,\
  \ and yearns to belong and to believe."
