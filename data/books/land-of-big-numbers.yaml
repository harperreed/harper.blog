description: "A debut collection from an extraordinary new talent that vividly gives\
  \ voice to the men and women of modern China and its diaspora<br /><br />Gripping\
  \ and compassionate, Land of Big Numbers depicts the diverse and legion Chinese\
  \ people, their history, their government, and how all of that has tumbled\u2014\
  messily, violently, but still beautifully\u2014into the present.<br /> <br />Cutting\
  \ between clear-eyed realism and tongue-in-cheek magical realism, Chen\u2019s stories\
  \ coalesce into a portrait of a people striving for openings where mobility is limited.\
  \ Twins take radically different paths: one becomes a professional gamer, the other\
  \ a political activist. A woman moves to the city to work at a government call center\
  \ and is followed by her violent ex-boyfriend. A man is swept into the high-risk,\
  \ high-reward temptations of China\u2019s volatile stock exchange. And a group of\
  \ people sit, trapped for no reason, on a subway platform for months, waiting for\
  \ official permission to leave.<br /> <br />With acute social insight, Te-Ping Chen\
  \ layers years of experience reporting on the ground in China with incantatory prose\
  \ in this taut, surprising debut, proving herself both a remarkable cultural critic\
  \ and an astonishingly accomplished new literary voice."
