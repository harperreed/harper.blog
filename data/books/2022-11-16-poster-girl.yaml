description: '<strong>For fans of Anthony Marra and Lauren Beukes, #1 <em>New York
  Times</em> bestselling author Veronica Roth tells the story of a woman''s desperate
  search for a missing girl after the collapse of the oppressive dystopian regime--and
  the dark secrets about her family and community she uncovers along the way.</strong><br
  /><br />WHAT''S RIGHT IS RIGHT.<br /><br />Sonya Kantor knows this slogan--she lived
  by it for most of her life. For decades, everyone in the Seattle-Portland megalopolis
  lived under it, as well as constant surveillance in the form of the Insight, an
  ocular implant that tracked every word and every action, rewarding or punishing
  by a rigid moral code set forth by the Delegation.<br /><br />And then there was
  a revolution. The Delegation fell. And its most valuable members were locked in
  the Aperture, a prison on the outskirts of the city. And everyone else, now free
  from the Insight''s monitoring, went on with their lives.<br /><br />Sonya, former
  poster girl for the Delegation, has been imprisoned for ten years when an old enemy
  comes to her with a deal: find a missing girl who was stolen from her parents by
  the old regime, and earn her freedom. The path Sonya takes to find the child will
  lead her through an unfamiliar, crooked post-Delegation world where she finds herself
  digging deeper into the past--and her family''s dark secrets--than she ever wanted
  to.<br /><br />With razor sharp prose, <em>Poster Girl</em> is a haunting dystopian
  mystery that explores the expanding role of surveillance on society--an inescapable
  reality, even if cracked.'
