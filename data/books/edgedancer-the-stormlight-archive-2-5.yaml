description: "From Brandon Sanderson comes a short novel of the #1 New York Times\
  \ bestselling Stormlight Archive (previously published in Arcanum Unbounded ).<br\
  \ /><br />Three years ago, Lift asked a goddess to stop her from growing older\u2014\
  a wish she believed was granted. Now, in Edgedancer , the barely teenage nascent\
  \ Knight Radiant finds that time stands still for no one. Although the young Azish\
  \ emperor granted her safe haven from an executioner she knows only as Darkness,\
  \ court life is suffocating the free-spirited Lift, who can\u2019t help heading\
  \ to Yeddaw when she hears the relentless Darkness is there hunting people like\
  \ her with budding powers. The downtrodden in Yeddaw have no champion, and Lift\
  \ knows she must seize this awesome responsibility."

      description: "\n\n    Brandon Sanderson's epic fantasy cycle tells the story\
        \ of Roshar, a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power\
        \ sweep across the rocky terrain. It has been centuries since the fall of\
        \ the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades\
        \ and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform\
        \ ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. As brutal wars rage over the\
        \ control of these magical weapons, an ancient text called The Way of Kings\
        \ tells of ancient times, the Knights Radiant, and perhaps the true cause\
        \ of the war. The Knights Radiant must stand again.\r\n    \r\n    https://us.macmillan.com/series/thestormlightarchive\r\
        \n    \r\n    #0.5, <I>The Way of Kings Prime</I>, was written in 2002 and\
        \ is basically an alternate version of <I>The Way of Kings</I>, which was\
        \ published by Tor Books in 2010. <I>The Way of Kings Prime</I> is very different\
        \ from the published book. Think of it as set in a different universe with\
        \ a completely different plot. <B>If you haven\u2019t read the 2010 canonical\
        \ version, please read that one first.</B> -- from author's website (emphasis\
        \ mine)\r\n    \r\n    One novel set in this world is the short story \"Rysn\"\
        \ from the anthology Epic - Legends of Fantasy. \r\n    \r\n    The Stormlight\
        \ Archive series will have 10 books: first five books will form first part\
        \ sequence, while other five books will form the second part of the series.\r\
