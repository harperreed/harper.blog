description: "A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam &amp; Cat star\
  \ Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor\u2014including eating\
  \ disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother\u2014\
  and how she retook control of her life.<br /><br />Jennette McCurdy was six years\
  \ old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother\u2019s dream was for her\
  \ only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother\
  \ happy. So she went along with what Mom called \u201Ccalorie restriction,\u201D\
  \ eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home\
  \ makeovers while Mom chided, \u201CYour eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think\
  \ Dakota Fanning doesn\u2019t tint hers?\u201D She was even showered by Mom until\
  \ age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.<br /><br />In\
  \ I\u2019m Glad My Mom Died , Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail\u2014\
  just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a\
  \ new Nickelodeon series called iCarly , she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is\
  \ ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with\
  \ the paparazzi (\u201CHi Gale!\u201D), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame,\
  \ and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series\
  \ of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking\
  \ the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam &amp; Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother\
  \ dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette\
  \ embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really\
  \ wants.<br /><br />Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I\u2019m Glad My\
  \ Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing\
  \ your own hair."
