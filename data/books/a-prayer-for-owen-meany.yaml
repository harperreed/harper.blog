description: "In the summer of 1953, two eleven-year-old boys\u2014best friends\u2014\
  are playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire. One of\
  \ the boys hits a foul ball that kills the other boy\u2019s mother. The boy who\
  \ hits the ball doesn\u2019t believe in accidents; Owen Meany believes he is God\u2019\
  s instrument. What happens to Owen, after that 1953 foul ball, is extraordinary\
  \ and terrifying.<br /><br />A Prayer for Owen Meany was first published in 1989.\
  \ This Modern Library edition includes a new Introduction by the author."
