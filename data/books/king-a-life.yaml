description: "The first full biography in decades, King mixes revelatory and exhaustive\
  \ new research with brisk and accessible storytelling to forge the definitive life\
  \ for our times. <br /><br />Vividly written and exhaustively researched, Jonathan\
  \ Eig\u2019s A Life is the first major biography in decades of the civil rights\
  \ icon Martin Luther King Jr.\u2014and the first to include recently declassified\
  \ FBI files. In this revelatory new portrait of the preacher and activist who shook\
  \ the world, the bestselling biographer gives us an intimate view of the courageous\
  \ and often emotionally troubled human being who demanded peaceful protest for his\
  \ movement but was rarely at peace with himself. He casts fresh light on the King\
  \ family\u2019s origins as well as MLK\u2019s complex relationships with his wife,\
  \ father, and fellow activists. King reveals a minister wrestling with his own human\
  \ frailties and dark moods, a citizen hunted by his own government, and a man determined\
  \ to fight for justice even if it proved to be a fight to the death. As he follows\
  \ MLK from the classroom to the pulpit to the streets of Birmingham, Selma, and\
  \ Memphis, Eig dramatically re-creates the journey of a man who recast American\
  \ race relations and became our only modern-day founding father\u2014as well as\
  \ the nation\u2019s most mourned martyr. <br /><br />In this landmark biography,\
  \ Eig gives us an MLK for our a deep thinker, a brilliant strategist, and a committed\
  \ radical who led one of history\u2019s greatest movements, and whose demands for\
  \ racial and economic justice remain as urgent today as they were in his lifetime.\
  \ <br /><br />Includes 8 pages of black-and-white photographs"
