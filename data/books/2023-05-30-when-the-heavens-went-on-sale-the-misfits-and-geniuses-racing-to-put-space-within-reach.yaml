description: "<b>An Instant <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller<br /><br />A momentous\
  \ look at the private companies building a revolutionary new economy in space, from\
  \ the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Elon Musk</i></b><br /><br\
  \ />In <i>When the Heavens Went on Sale</i>, Ashlee Vance illuminates our future\
  \ and unveils the next big technology story of our time: welcome to the Wild West\
  \ of aerospace engineering and its unprecedented impact on our lives.<br /><br />With\
  \ the launch of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 1 rocket in 2008, Silicon Valley began to realize\
  \ that the universe itself was open for business. Now, Vance tells the remarkable,\
  \ unfolding story of this frenzied intergalactic land grab by following four pioneering\
  \ companies\u2014Astra, Firefly, Planet Labs, and Rocket Lab\u2014as they build\
  \ new space systems and attempt to launch rockets and satellites into orbit by the\
  \ thousands.<br /><br />With the public fixated on the space tourism being driven\
  \ by the likes of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson, these new, scrappy\
  \ companies arrived with a different set of goals: to make rocket and satellite\
  \ launches fast and cheap, thereby opening Earth\u2019s lower orbit for business.\
  \ Vance has had a front-row seat and singular access to this peculiar and unprecedented\
  \ moment in history, and he chronicles it all in full color: the top-secret launch\
  \ locations, communes, gun-toting bodyguards, drugs, espionage investigations, and\
  \ multimillionaires guzzling booze to dull the pain as their fortunes disappear.<br\
  \ /><br />Through immersive and intimate reporting, <i>When the Heavens Went on\
  \ Sale</i> reveals the spectacular chaos of the new business of space, and what\
  \ happens when the idealistic, ambitious minds of Silicon Valley turn their unbridled\
  \ vision toward the limitless expanse of the stars. This is the tale of technology\u2019\
  s most pressing and controversial revolution, as told through fascinating characters\
  \ chasing unimaginable stakes in the race to space."
