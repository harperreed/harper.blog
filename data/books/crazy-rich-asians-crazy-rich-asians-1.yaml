description: <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> is the outrageously funny debut novel about
  three super-rich, pedigreed Chinese families and the gossip, backbiting, and scheming
  that occurs when the heir to one of the most massive fortunes in Asia brings home
  his ABC (American-born Chinese) girlfriend to the wedding of the season.<br />When
  Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her boyfriend, Nicholas
  Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives to explore the island, and
  quality time with the man she might one day marry. What she doesn't know is that
  Nick's family home happens to look like a palace, that she'll ride in more private
  planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's most eligible bachelors on her arm,
  Rachel might as well have a target on her back. Initiated into a world of dynastic
  splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the It Girl of Singapore society;
  Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages of the Hong Kong socialite magazines;
  and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings about
  who her son should--and should not--marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with
  jaw-dropping opulence, Crazy Rich Asians is an insider's look at the Asian JetSet;
  a perfect depiction of the clash between old money and new money; between Overseas
  Chinese and Mainland Chinese; and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young,
  in love, and gloriously, <i>crazily</i> rich.
