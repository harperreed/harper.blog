description: Award-winning filmmaker and performing artist Miranda July brings her
  extraordinary talents to the page in a startling, sexy, and tender collection. In
  these stories, July gives the most seemingly insignificant moments a sly potency.
  A benign encounter, a misunderstanding, a shy revelation can reconfigure the world.
  Her characters engage awkwardly -- they are sometimes too remote, sometimes too
  intimate. With great compassion and generosity, July reveals their idiosyncrasies
  and the odd logic and longing that govern their lives. No One Belongs Here More
  Than You is a stunning debut, the work of a writer with a spectacularly original
  and compelling voice.
