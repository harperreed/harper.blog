description: "<b>An explosive memoir charting one woman\u2019s career at the heart\
  \ of one of the most influential companies on the planet, <i>Careless People</i>\
  \ gives you a front-row seat to Facebook, the decisions that have shaped world events\
  \ in recent decades, and the people who made them.</b><br /><br />From trips on\
  \ private jets and encounters with world leaders to shocking accounts of misogyny\
  \ and double standards behind the scenes, this searing memoir exposes both the personal\
  \ and the political fallout when unfettered power and a rotten company culture take\
  \ hold. In a gripping and often absurd narrative where a few people carelessly hold\
  \ the world in their hands, this eye-opening memoir reveals what really goes on\
  \ among the global elite.<br /><br />Sarah Wynn-Williams tells the wrenching but\
  \ fun story of Facebook, mapping its rise from stumbling encounters with juntas\
  \ to Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s reaction when he learned of Facebook\u2019s role in\
  \ Trump\u2019s election. She experiences the challenges and humiliations of working\
  \ motherhood within a pressure cooker of a workplace, all while Sheryl Sandberg\
  \ urges her and others to \u201Clean in.\u201D<br /><br /><i>Careless People</i>\
  \ is a deeply personal account of why and how things have gone so horribly wrong\
  \ in the past decade\u2014told in a sharp, candid, and utterly disarming voice.\
  \ A deep, unflinching look at the role that social media has assumed in our lives,\
  \ <i>Careless People</i> reveals the truth about the leaders of Facebook: how the\
  \ more power they grasp, the less responsible they become and the consequences this\
  \ has for all of us."
