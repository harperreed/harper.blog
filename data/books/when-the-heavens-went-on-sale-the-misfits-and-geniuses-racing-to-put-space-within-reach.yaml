description: '<strong>A momentous look at the private companies driving a revolutionary
  new economy in space, from the <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of <em>Elon
  Musk</em></strong><br /><br />With the launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2008, Elon
  Musk''s SpaceX became the first private company to build a low-cost rocket that
  could reach orbit. And that milestone carried major implications: Silicon Valley,
  not NASA or nation states, was suddenly cemented as the epicenter of the new Space
  Age. Start-ups and the wealthy investors behind them began to realize that the universe--ungoverned
  and infinite--was open for business. Welcome to the Wild West of aerospace engineering.<br
  /><br /><em>When the Heavens Went on Sale </em>tells the remarkable, unfolding story
  of this frenzied intergalactic land grab. Through his trademark immersive reporting,
  Ashlee Vance follows four pioneering companies--Astra, Firefly, Planet Labs, and
  Rocket Lab--as they build new space systems and attempt to launch rockets and satellites
  into orbit by the thousands. While the public fixated on the space tourism being
  driven by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson, these new companies arrived
  with a different set of goals: to make rocket and satellite launches fast and cheap,
  thereby opening Earth''s lower orbit for business--and setting it up as the next
  playing field for humankind''s technological evolution, where we can connect, analyze,
  and monitor everything on Earth.<br /><br />Vance has had a front-row seat and singular
  access to this peculiar and unprecedented moment in history. <em>When the Heavens
  Went on Sale</em> travels through private company headquarters, labs, and top-secret
  launch locations around the world, including California, Texas, Alaska, New Zealand,
  Ukraine, India, and French Guiana. He chronicles it all in full color: the private
  jets, communes, gun-toting bodyguards, drugs, espionage investigations, and multimillionaires
  guzzling booze to dull the pain as their fortunes disappear.<br /><br />With the
  most detailed and intimate reporting of Vance''s career, <em>When the Heavens Went
  on Sale </em>reveals the spectacular chaos of the new business of space, and what
  happens when the idealistic, ambitious minds of Silicon Valley turn their unbridled
  vision toward the limitless expanse of the stars. This is the most pressing and
  controversial technology story of our time, a tale of fascinating characters chasing
  unimaginable stakes as they race to space.'
