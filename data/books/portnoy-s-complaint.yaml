description: With a new Afterword by the author for the 25th Anniversary edition.<br
  />"Touching as well as hilariously lewd.... Roth is vibrantly talented...as marvelous
  a mimic and fantasist as has been produced by the most verbal group in human history."<br
  />--Alfred Kazin, "New York Review of Books" <br />"Deliciously funny...absurd and
  exuberant, wild and uproarious... a brilliantly vivid reading experience."-- "New
  York Times Book Review"
