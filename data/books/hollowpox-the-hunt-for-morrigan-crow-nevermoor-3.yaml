description: "<b>The captivating and heart-pounding third book in the instant <i>New\
  \ York Times</i> bestselling Nevermoor series, as heroine Morrigan battles a new\
  \ evil.</b><b>\n  <br />\n</b>Morrigan Crow and her friends have survived their\
  \ first year as proud scholars of the elite Wundrous Society, helped bring down\
  \ the nefarious Ghastly Market, and proven themselves loyal to Unit 919. Now Morrigan\
  \ faces a new, exciting challenge: to master the mysterious <i>Wretched Arts of\
  \ the Accomplished Wundersmith</i>, and control the power that threatens to consume\
  \ her.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a strange and frightening illness has taken hold of\
  \ Nevermoor, turning infected Wunimals into mindless, vicious Unnimals on the hunt.\
  \ As victims of the Hollowpox multiply, panic spreads. There are whispers - growing\
  \ louder every day - that this catastrophe can only be the work of the Wundersmith,\
  \ Ezra Squall.<br /><br />But inside the walls of Wunsoc, everyone knows there is\
  \ a <i>new</i> Wundersmith - one who's much closer to home. With Nevermoor in a\
  \ state of fear and the truth about Morrigan threatening to get out, the city she\
  \ loves becomes the most perilous place in the world. Morrigan must try to find\
  \ a cure for the Hollowpox, but it will put her - and everyone in Nevermoor - in\
  \ more danger than she could have imagined.<br />"
