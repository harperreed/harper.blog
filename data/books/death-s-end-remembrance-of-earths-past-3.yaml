description: With <i>The Three-Body Problem</i>, English-speaking readers got their
  first chance to experience the multiple-award-winning and bestselling Remembrance
  of Earth's Past trilogy by China's most beloved science fiction author, Cixin Liu.
  <i>The Three-Body Problem</i> was released to great acclaim including coverage in
  The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and won the Hugo Award for Best SF
  Novel (2015). It was also named a finalist for the Nebula Award (2014) making it
  the first translated novel to be nominated for a major SF award since Italo Calvino's
  <i>Invisible Cities</i> in 1976. <br /><br />Now this epic trilogy concludes with
  <i>Death's End</i>. Half a century after the Doomsday Battle, the uneasy balance
  of Dark Forest Deterrence keeps the Trisolaran invaders at bay. Earth enjoys unprecedented
  prosperity due to the infusion of Trisolaran knowledge. With human science advancing
  daily and the Trisolarans adopting Earth culture, it seems that the two civilizations
  will soon be able to co-exist peacefully as equals without the terrible threat of
  mutually assured annihilation. But the peace has also made humanity complacent.<br
  /><br />Cheng Xin, an aerospace engineer from the early 21st century, awakens from
  hibernation in this new age. She brings with her knowledge of a long-forgotten program
  dating from the beginning of the Trisolar Crisis and her very presence may upset
  the delicate balance between two worlds. Will humanity reach for the stars or die
  in its cradle?
