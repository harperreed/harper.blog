description: <b>The conclusion to the trilogy that began with <i>Ancillary Justice</i>.</b><br
  /><br />For a moment, things seemed to be under control for Breq, the soldier who
  used to be a warship. Then a search of Athoek Station's slums turns up someone who
  shouldn't exist, and a messenger from the mysterious Presger empire arrives, as
  does Breq's enemy, the divided and quite possibly insane Anaander Mianaai - ruler
  of an empire at war with itself.<br /><br />Breq refuses to flee with her ship and
  crew, because that would leave the people of Athoek in terrible danger. The odds
  aren't good, but that's never stopped her before.
