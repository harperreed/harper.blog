description: "<i>Traduttore, traditore:</i> An act of translation is always an act\
  \ of betrayal. <br /><br />1828. Robin Swift, orphaned by cholera in Canton, is\
  \ brought to London by the mysterious Professor Lovell. There, he trains for years\
  \ in Latin, Ancient Greek, and Chinese, all in preparation for the day he'll enroll\
  \ in Oxford University's prestigious Royal Institute of Translation \u2014 also\
  \ known as Babel. <br /><br />Babel is the world's center of translation and, more\
  \ importantly, of silver-working: the art of manifesting the meaning lost in translation\
  \ through enchanted silver bars, to magical effect. Silver-working has made the\
  \ British Empire unparalleled in power, and Babel's research in foreign languages\
  \ serves the Empire's quest to colonize everything it encounters.<br /><br />Oxford,\
  \ the city of dreaming spires, is a fairytale for Robin; a utopia dedicated to the\
  \ pursuit of knowledge. But knowledge serves power, and for Robin, a Chinese boy\
  \ raised in Britain, serving Babel inevitably means betraying his motherland. As\
  \ his studies progress Robin finds himself caught between Babel and the shadowy\
  \ Hermes Society, an organization dedicated to sabotaging the silver-working that\
  \ supports imperial expansion. When Britain pursues an unjust war with China over\
  \ silver and opium, Robin must decide: Can powerful institutions be changed from\
  \ within, or does revolution always require violence? What is he willing to sacrifice\
  \ to bring Babel down? <br /><br />Babel \u2014 a thematic response to The Secret\
  \ History and a tonal response to Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell \u2014 grapples\
  \ with student revolutions, colonial resistance, and the use of translation as a\
  \ tool of empire."
