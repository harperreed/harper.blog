description: "In June 2017, Travis Kalanick, the hard-charging CEO of Uber, was ousted\
  \ in a boardroom coup that capped a brutal year for the transportation giant. Uber\
  \ had catapulted to the top of the tech world, yet for many came to symbolize everything\
  \ wrong with Silicon Valley.<br /><br /><br />Award-winning <em>New York Times</em>\
  \ technology correspondent Mike Isaac\u2019s <em>Super Pumped</em> presents the\
  \ dramatic rise and fall of Uber, set against an era of rapid upheaval in Silicon\
  \ Valley. Backed by billions in venture capital dollars and led by a brash and ambitious\
  \ founder, Uber promised to revolutionize the way we move people and goods through\
  \ the world. A near instant \u201Cunicorn,\u201D Uber seemed poised to take its\
  \ place next to Amazon, Apple, and Google as a technology giant.<br /><br /><br\
  \ />What followed would become a corporate cautionary tale about the perils of startup\
  \ culture and a vivid example of how blind worship of startup founders can go wildly\
  \ wrong. Isaac recounts Uber\u2019s pitched battles with taxi unions and drivers,\
  \ the company\u2019s toxic internal culture, and the bare-knuckle tactics it devised\
  \ to overcome obstacles in its quest for dominance. With billions of dollars at\
  \ stake, Isaac shows how venture capitalists asserted their power and seized control\
  \ of the startup as it fought its way toward its fateful IPO.<br /><br /><br />Based\
  \ on hundreds of interviews with current and former Uber employees, along with previously\
  \ unpublished documents, <em>Super Pumped</em> is a page-turning story of ambition\
  \ and deception, obscene wealth, and bad behavior that explores how blistering technological\
  \ and financial innovation culminated in one of the most catastrophic twelve-month\
  \ periods in American corporate history."
