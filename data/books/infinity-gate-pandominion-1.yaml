description: "The Pandominion is a political and trading alliance consisting of roughly\
  \ a million worlds. But they\u2019re really all the same world\u2014Earth\u2014\
  in many different dimensions. And when an AI threat arises that could destroy everything\
  \ the Pandominion has built, they\u2019ll eradicate it by whatever means necessary\u2014\
  no matter the cost to human life. <br /><br />From the author of the bestselling\
  \ <i>The Girl With All the Gifts</i> comes a brilliant new genre-defying story of\
  \ humanity's expansion across millions of dimensions, and the AI technology that\
  \ might see it all come to an end. Perfect for readers of <i>The Space Between Worlds</i>\
  \ and Adrian Tchaikovsky."
