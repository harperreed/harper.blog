  \ his body, Ceony Twill is well on her way to becoming a Folder. Unfortunately,\
  \ not all of Ceony\u2019s thoughts have been focused on paper magic. Though she\

  \ barrier with Emery, despite their growing closeness.</p><p>When a magician with\
  \ a penchant for revenge believes that Ceony possesses a secret, he vows to discover\
  \ it\u2026even if it tears apart the very fabric of their magical world. After a\
  \ series of attacks target Ceony and catch those she holds most dear in the crossfire,\
  \ Ceony knows she must find the true limits of her powers\u2026and keep her knowledge\
  \ from falling into wayward hands.</p><p>The delightful sequel to Charlie N. Holmberg\u2019\
  s <i>The Paper Magician</i>, <i>The Glass Magician</i> will charm readers young\
  \ and old alike.</p>"
