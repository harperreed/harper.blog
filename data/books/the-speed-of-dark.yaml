description: "<i>In the near future, disease will be a condition of the past. Most\
  \ genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately,\
  \ there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation,\
  \ small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to\
  \ get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and\
  \ contributing members of society. But they will never be normal.<br /></i><br />Lou\
  \ Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap\
  \ the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic\
  \ adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and\
  \ a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives\
  \ a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact.\
  \ He has taught himself to use \u201Cplease\u201D and \u201Cthank you\u201D and\
  \ other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable.\
  \ He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself.\
  \ <br /><br />But then his quiet life comes under attack. It starts with an experimental\
  \ treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment\
  \ Lou would think and act and <i>be</i> just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly\
  \ free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical\
  \ music\u2013with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same\
  \ colors and patterns in the world\u2013shades and hues that others cannot see?\
  \ Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to\
  \ reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a \u201C\
  normal\u201D?<br /><br />There are intense pressures coming from the world around\
  \ him\u2013including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the\
  \ supports necessary to employ autistic workers. Perhaps even more disturbing are\
  \ the barrage of questions within himself. For Lou must decide if he should submit\
  \ to a surgery that might completely change the way he views the world . . . and\
  \ the very essence of who he is.<br /><br />Thoughtful, provocative, poignant, unforgettable,\
  \ <i>The Speed of Dark</i> is a gripping exploration into the mind of an autistic\
  \ person as he struggles with profound questions of humanity and matters of the\
  \ heart.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"
