description: 'A millennium into the future two advancements have altered the course
  of human history: the colonization of the galaxy and the creation of the positronic
  brain. Isaac Asimov''s "Robot" novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between
  a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together.
  <br /><br />Like most people left behind on an over-populated Earth, New York City
  police detective Elijah Baley had little love for either the arrogant Spacers or
  their robotic companions. But when a prominent Spacer is murdered under mysterious
  circumstances, Baley is ordered to the Outer Worlds to help track down the killer.
  <br /><br />The relationship between Lije and his Spacer superiors, who distrusted
  all Earthmen, was strained from the start. Then he learned that they had assigned
  him a partner: R. Daneel Olivaw. Worst of all was that the "R" stood for robot--and
  his positronic partner was made in the image and likeness of the murder victim!'
