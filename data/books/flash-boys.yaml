description: "<b>From the #1 bestselling author of <i>The Blind Side </i>and <i>Moneyball</i></b><br\
  \ /><br />Four years after his #1 bestseller <i>The Big Short</i>, Michael Lewis\
  \ returns to Wall Street to report on a high-tech predator stalking the equity markets.<br\
  \ /><br /><i>Flash Boys</i> is about a small group of Wall Street guys who figure\
  \ out that the US stock market has been rigged for the benefit of insiders and that,\
  \ post-financial crisis, the markets have become not more free but <i>less</i>,\
  \ and more controlled by the big Wall Street banks. Working at different firms,\
  \ they come to this realization separately; but after they discover each other,\
  \ the flash boys band together and set out to reform the financial markets. This\
  \ they do by creating an exchange in which high-frequency trading\u2014source of\
  \ the most intractable problems\u2014will have no advantage whatsoever.<br /><br\
  \ />The characters in <i>Flash Boys</i> are fabulous, each completely different\
  \ from what you think of when you think \u201CWall Street guy.\u201D Several have\
  \ walked away from jobs in the financial sector that paid them millions of dollars\
  \ a year. From their new vantage point they investigate the big banks, the world\u2019\
  s stock exchanges, and high-frequency trading firms as they have never been investigated,\
  \ and expose the many strange new ways that Wall Street generates profits.<br /><br\
  \ />The light that Lewis shines into the darkest corners of the financial world\
  \ may not be good for your blood pressure, because if you have any contact with\
  \ the market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you. But in\
  \ the end, <i>Flash Boys </i>is an uplifting story. Here are people who have somehow\
  \ preserved a moral sense in an environment where you don\u2019t get paid for that;\
  \ they have perceived an institutionalized injustice and are willing to go to war\
  \ to fix it."
