description: "Look closely at any typically \u201CAmerican\u201D article of clothing\
  \ these days, and you may be surprised to see a Japanese label inside. From high-end\
  \ denim to oxford button-downs, Japanese designers have taken the classic American\
  \ look\u2014known as <i>ametora</i>, or \u201CAmerican traditional\u201D\u2014and\
  \ turned it into a huge business for companies like Uniqlo, Kamakura Shirts, Evisu,\
  \ and Kapital. This phenomenon is part of a long dialogue between Japanese and American\
  \ fashion; in fact, many of the basic items and traditions of the modern American\
  \ wardrobe are alive and well today thanks to the stewardship of Japanese consumers\
  \ and fashion cognoscenti, who ritualized and preserved these American styles during\
  \ periods when they were out of vogue in their native land.<br /><br />In <i>Ametora</i>,\
  \ cultural historian W. David Marx traces the Japanese assimilation of American\
  \ fashion over the past hundred and fifty years, showing how Japanese trendsetters\
  \ and entrepreneurs mimicked, adapted, imported, and ultimately perfected American\
  \ style, dramatically reshaping not only Japan\u2019s culture but also our own in\
  \ the process.<br />"
