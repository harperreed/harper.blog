description: "Keiko Furukura had always been considered a strange child, and her parents\
  \ always worried how she would get on in the real world, so when she takes on a\
  \ job in a convenience store while at university, they are delighted for her. For\
  \ her part, in the convenience store she finds a predictable world mandated by the\
  \ store manual, which dictates how the workers should act and what they should say,\
  \ and she copies her coworkers\u2019 style of dress and speech patterns so that\
  \ she can play the part of a normal person. However, eighteen years later, at age\
  \ 36, she is still in the same job, has never had a boyfriend, and has only few\
  \ friends. She feels comfortable in her life, but is aware that she is not living\
  \ up to society\u2019s expectations and causing her family to worry about her. When\
  \ a similarly alienated but cynical and bitter young man comes to work in the store,\
  \ he will upset Keiko\u2019s contented stasis\u2014but will it be for the better?<br\
  \ /> <br /> Sayaka Murata brilliantly captures the atmosphere of the familiar convenience\
  \ store that is so much part of life in Japan. With some laugh-out-loud moments\
  \ prompted by the disconnect between Keiko\u2019s thoughts and those of the people\
  \ around her, she provides a sharp look at Japanese society and the pressure to\
  \ conform, as well as penetrating insights into the female mind. <i>Convenience\
  \ Store Woman</i> is a fresh, charming portrait of an unforgettable heroine that\
  \ recalls Banana Yoshimoto, Han Kang, and <i>Am\xE9lie</i>."
