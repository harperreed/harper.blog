description: Interest in Pink Floyd remains as intense as ever even 40 years after
  the release of Dark Side of the Moon, with lavish box-sets collecting demos and
  out-takes, and Roger Waters' world tours of The Wall playing to packed stadiums.<br
  />Now, Mark Blake' s superbly comprehensive and engrossing history of the group,
  rightly acclaimed as the definitive book on the band, has been fully revised and
  extended with new interviews to bring the story up to date with the recent appearances
  of David Gilmour and Nick Mason with Roger Waters at a London date on his The Wall
  tour. <br />
