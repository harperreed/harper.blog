description: "In 1815 Edmond Dant\xE8s, a young and successful merchant sailor who\
  \ has just recently been granted the succession of his erstwhile captain Lecl\xE8\
  re, returns to Marseille to marry his Catalan fianc\xE9e Merc\xE9d\xE8s. Thrown\
  \ in prison for a crime he has not committed, Edmond Dant\xE8s is confined to the\
  \ grim fortress of If. There he learns of a great hoard of treasure hidden on the\
  \ Isle of Monte Cristo and he becomes determined not only to escape, but also to\
  \ unearth the treasure and use it to plot the destruction of the three men responsible\
  \ for his incarceration."
