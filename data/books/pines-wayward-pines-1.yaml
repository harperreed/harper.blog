description: "Wayward Pines, Idaho, is quintessential small-town America--or so it\
  \ seems. Secret Service agent Ethan Burke arrives in search of two missing federal\
  \ agents, yet soon is facing much more than he bargained for. After a violent accident\
  \ lands him in the hospital, Ethan comes to with no ID and no cell phone. The medical\
  \ staff seems friendly enough, but sometimes feels...off. As days pass, Ethan's\
  \ investigation into his colleagues' disappearance turns up more questions than\
  \ answers<br /><br />WHY CAN'T HE MAKE CONTACT WITH HIS FAMILY IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD?\
  \ WHY DOESN'T ANYONE BELIEVE HE IS WHO HE SAYS HE IS? AND WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF\
  \ THE ELECTRIFIED FENCES ENCIRCLING THE TOWN? ARE THEY KEEPING THE RESIDENTS IN?\
  \ OR SOMETHING ELSE OUT?<br /><br />Each step toward the truth takes Ethan further\
  \ from the world he knows, until he must face a horrifying fact\u2014he may never\
  \ get out of Wayward Pines alive....."
