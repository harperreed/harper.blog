description: '<b>The story of the idealists, technologists, and opportunists fighting
  to bring cryptocurrency to the masses.</b><b> </b><br /><br />In their short history,
  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gone through booms, busts, and internecine
  wars. Yet today they are very much still with us: Bitcoin currently trades for almost
  $10,000, the value of all crypto assets is greater than $250 billion. The central
  promise of crypto is too good to pass up-vast un-taxable fortunes made from decentralized
  networks not controlled by any single entity.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yet cryptocurrency
  was growing increasingly marginal until a brilliant new idea changed its fortunes
  once again: Ethereum. In this book, Laura Shin takes readers inside the creation
  of this new form of cryptocurrency network, which enabled users to launch their
  own new coins, and in so doing, created a new crypto fever. You''ll meet people
  like Vitalik Buterin, the wunderkind whose idea quickly became a $20 billion empire;
  Charles Hoskinson, the initial CEO who left the project within five months; and
  Joe Lubin, a former Goldman Sachs VP whose early involvement in Bitcoin and Ethereum
  helped him become one of crypto''s most well-known billionaires. Sparks flew as
  these outsized personalities fought for their piece of a seemingly limitless new
  business opportunity.<br /><br /><br /><br />The fortunes of crypto continue to
  rise and fall, but the people fighting to take it mainstream are making and losing
  fortunes and careers on it. This fascinating book shows the crypto market for what
  it really is: a deeply personal struggle for a revolution that may come tomorrow,
  or not at all.'
