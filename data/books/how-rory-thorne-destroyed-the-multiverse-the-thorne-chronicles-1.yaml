description: "<b>First in a duology that reimagines fairy tale tropes within a space\
  \ opera\u2014<i>The Princess Bride</i> meets Princess Leia.</b><br /><br />Rory\
  \ Thorne is a princess with thirteen fairy blessings, the most important of which\
  \ is to see through flattery and platitudes. As the eldest daughter, she always\
  \ imagined she'd inherit her father's throne and govern the interplanetary Thorne\
  \ Consortium.<br /><br />Then her father is assassinated, her mother gives birth\
  \ to a son, and Rory is betrothed to the prince of a distant world.<br /><br />When\
  \ Rory arrives in her new home, she uncovers a treacherous plot to unseat her newly\
  \ betrothed and usurp his throne. An unscrupulous minister has conspired to name\
  \ himself Regent to the minor (and somewhat foolish) prince. With only her wits\
  \ and a small team of allies, Rory must outmaneuver the Regent and rescue the prince.<br\
  \ /><br /><i>How Rory Thorne Destroyed the Multiverse</i> is a feminist reimagining\
  \ of familiar fairytale tropes and a story of resistance and self-determination\u2014\
  how small acts of rebellion can lead a princess to not just save herself, but change\
  \ the course of history."
