description: "<strong>A missing scientist and deep pockets pull\_Colonel Carl Butler\
  \ out of retirement, investigating another mystery that puts him and his team--and\
  \ the future of relations with alien species--in danger in\_COLONYSIDE, the exciting\
  \ follow-up to\_<em>Planetside</em>\_and\_<em>Spaceside</em>.</strong><br /><br\
  \ />A military hero is coming out of disgrace\u2014straight into the line of fire\u2026\
  <br /><br />Carl Butler was once a decorated colonel. Now he\u2019s a disgraced\
  \ recluse, hoping to live out the rest of his life on a backwater planet where no\
  \ one cares about his \u201Ccrimes\u201D and everyone leaves him alone.<br /><br\
  \ />It\u2019s never that easy.<br /><br />A CEO\u2019s daughter has gone missing\
  \ and he thinks Butler is the only one who can find her. The government is only\
  \ too happy to appease him. Butler isn\u2019t so sure, but he knows the pain of\
  \ losing a daughter, so he reluctantly signs on. Soon he\u2019s on a military ship\
  \ heading for a newly-formed colony where the dangerous jungle lurks just outside\
  \ the domes where settlers live.<br /><br />Paired with Mac, Ganos, and a government-assigned\
  \ aide named Fader, Butler dives head-first into what should be an open and shut\
  \ case. Then someone tries to blow him up. Faced with an incompetent local governor,\
  \ a hamstrung military, and corporations playing fast and loose with the laws, Butler\
  \ finds himself in familiar territory. He\u2019s got nobody to trust but himself,\
  \ but that\u2019s where he works best. He\u2019ll fight to get to the bottom of\
  \ the mystery, but this time, he might not live to solve it."
