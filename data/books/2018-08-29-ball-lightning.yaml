description: "<b>A new standalone military SF adventure from the <i>New York Times</i>\
  \ bestselling and award-winning author of the Three-Body Trilogy.</b><br /><br />When\
  \ Chen\u2019s parents are incinerated before his eyes by a blast of ball lightning,\
  \ he devotes his life to cracking the secret of mysterious natural phenomenon. His\
  \ search takes him to stormy mountaintops, an experimental military weapons lab,\
  \ and an old Soviet science station. <br /><br />The more he learns, the more he\
  \ comes to realize that ball lightning is just the tip of an entirely new frontier\
  \ in particle physics. Although Chen\u2019s quest provides a purpose for his lonely\
  \ life, his reasons for chasing his elusive quarry come into conflict with soldiers\
  \ and scientists who have motives of their own: a beautiful army major with an obsession\
  \ with dangerous weaponry, and a physicist who has no place for ethical considerations\
  \ in his single-minded pursuit of knowledge.<br /><br /><i> Ball Lightning</i>,\
  \ by award-winning Chinese science fiction author Cixin Liu, is a fast-paced story\
  \ of what happens when the beauty of scientific inquiry runs up against a push to\
  \ harness new discoveries with no consideration of their possible consequences.<br\
