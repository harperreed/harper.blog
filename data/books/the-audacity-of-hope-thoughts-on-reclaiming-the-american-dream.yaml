description: 'Barack Obama''s first book, <i>Dreams from My Father</i>, was a compelling
  and moving memoir focusing on personal issues of race, identity, and community.
  With his second book <i>The Audacity of Hope</i>, Obama engages themes raised in
  his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, shares personal views
  on faith and values and offers a vision of the future that involves repairing a
  "political process that is broken" and restoring a government that has fallen out
  of touch with the people. We had the opportunity to ask Senator Obama a few questions
  about writing, reading, and politics, see his responses below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i>  <div>
  <b> 20 Second Interview: A Few Words with Barack Obama</b><br><br><img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380909340i/3179697.jpg"
  class="gr-hostedUserImg"><b>Q:</b> How did writing a book that you knew would be
  read so closely by so many compare to writing your first book, when few people knew
  who you were?<br><b>A:</b> In many ways, <i>Dreams from My Father</i> was harder
  to write. At that point, I wasn''t even sure that I could write a book. And writing
  the first book really was a process of self-discovery, since it touched on my family
  and my childhood in a much more intimate way. On the other hand, writing <i>The
  Audacity of Hope</i> paralleled the work that I do every day--trying to give shape
  to all the issues that we face as a country, and providing my own personal stamp
  on them.<br><br><b>Q:</b> What is your writing process like? You have such a busy
  schedule, how did you find time to write?<br><b>A:</b> I''m a night owl, so I usually
  wrote at night after my Senate day was over, and after my family was asleep--from
  9:30 p.m. or so until 1 a.m. I would work off an outline--certain themes or stories
  that I wanted to tell--and get them down in longhand on a yellow pad. Then I''d
  edit while typing in what I''d written.<br><br><b>Q:</b> If readers are to come
  away from <i>The Audacity of Hope</i> with one action item (a New Year''s Resolution
  for 2007, perhaps?), what should it be?<br><b>A:</b> Get involved in an issue that
  you''re passionate about. It almost doesn''t matter what it is--improving the school
  system, developing strategies to wean ourselves off foreign oil, expanding health
  care for kids. We give too much of our power away, to the professional politicians,
  to the lobbyists, to cynicism. And our democracy suffers as a result.<br><br><b>Q:</b>
  You''re known for being able to work with people across ideological lines. Is that
  possible in today''s polarized Washington?<br><b>A:</b> It is possible. There are
  a lot of well-meaning people in both political parties. Unfortunately, the political
  culture tends to emphasize conflict, the media emphasizes conflict, and the structure
  of our campaigns rewards the negative. I write about these obstacles in chapter
  4 of my book, "Politics." When you focus on solving problems instead of scoring
  political points, and emphasize common sense over ideology, you''d be surprised
  what can be accomplished. It also helps if you''re willing to give other people
  credit--something politicians have a hard time doing sometimes.<br><br><b>Q:</b>
  How do you make people passionate about moderate and complex ideas?<br><b>A:</b>
  I think the country recognizes that the challenges we face aren''t amenable to sound-bite
  solutions. People are looking for serious solutions to complex problems. I don''t
  think we need more moderation per se--I think we should be bolder in promoting universal
  health care, or dealing with global warming. We just need to understand that actually
  solving these problems won''t be easy, and that whatever solutions we come up with
  will require consensus among groups with divergent interests. That means everybody
  has to listen, and everybody has to give a little. That''s not easy to do.<br><br><b>Q:</b>
  What has surprised you most about the way Washington works?<br><b>A:</b> How little
  serious debate and deliberation takes place on the floor of the House or the Senate.<br><br><b>Q:</b>
  You talk about how we have a personal responsibility to educate our children. What
  small thing can the average parent (or person) do to help improve the educational
  system in America? What small thing can make a big impact?<br><b>A:</b> Nothing
  has a bigger impact than reading to children early in life. Obviously we all have
  a personal obligation to turn off the TV and read to our own children; but beyond
  that, participating in a literacy program, working with parents who themselves may
  have difficulty reading, helping their children with their literacy skills, can
  make a huge difference in a child''s life.<br><br><b>Q:</b> Do you ever find time
  to read? What kinds of books do you try to make time for? What is on your nightstand
  now? <br><b>A:</b> Unfortunately, I had very little time to read while I was writing.
  I''m trying to make up for lost time now. My tastes are pretty eclectic. I just
  finished Marilynne Robinson''s <i>Gilead</i>, a wonderful book. The language just
  shimmers. I''ve started <i>Team of Rivals</i> by Doris Kearns Goodwin, which is
  a great study of Lincoln as a political strategist. I read just about anything by
  Toni Morrison, E.L. Doctorow, or Philip Roth. And I''ve got a soft spot for John
  le Carre.<br><br><b>Q:</b> What inspires you? How do you stay motivated?<br><b>A:</b>
  I''m inspired by the people I meet in my travels--hearing their stories, seeing
  the hardships they overcome, their fundamental optimism and decency. I''m inspired
  by the love people have for their children. And I''m inspired by my own children,
  how full they make my heart. They make me want to work to make the world a little
  bit better. And they make me want to be a better man.<br><br>
