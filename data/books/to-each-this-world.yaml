description: <b>From an Aurora Award-winning author, a new sci-fi novel follows three
  intrepid humans caught up in a conflict that stretches across time and space.</b><br
  /><br />Biologist Julie E. Czerneda's new standalone science fiction novel, <i>To
  Each This World </i>follows a desperate mission to reconnect with long lost sleeper
  ships, sent centuries earlier from Earth to settle distant worlds.<br /><br />A
  trio of Humans must work with their mysterious alien allies to rescue any descendants
  they can find on those worlds. Something is out there, determined to claim the cosmos
  for itself, and only on Earth will Humans be safe.<br /><br />Or will they?<br /><br
  />The challenge isn't just to communicate with your own kind after generations have
  passed. It's to understand what isn't your kind at all.<br /><br />And how far will
  trust take you, when the truth depends on what you are?
