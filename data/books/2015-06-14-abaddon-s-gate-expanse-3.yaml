description: The explosive third novel in James S.A. Corey's <i>New York Times </i>bestselling
  Expanse series.<br /> For generations, the solar system -- Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid
  Belt -- was humanity's great frontier. Until now. The alien artifact working through
  its program under the clouds of Venus has appeared in Uranus's orbit, where it has
  built a massive gate that leads to a starless dark.<br /><br />Jim Holden and the
  crew of the <em>Rocinante</em> are part of a vast flotilla of scientific and military
  ships going out to examine the artifact. But behind the scenes, a complex plot is
  unfolding, with the destruction of Holden at its core. As the emissaries of the
  human race try to find whether the gate is an opportunity or a threat, the greatest
  danger is the one they brought with them.

      note: 'Not entirely sure where to put The Vital Abyss. I would have to re-read
        it to be sure, but I think it might end just before Nemesis Games, which would
        make #4.5 the spot for it. I think the #3.5 ordering is based on the time
        period of the main events of the novella, rather than the time period of the
        last events of the novella. However, I''m leaving it at #5.5 for now, since
        the chronology is unclear and reading it before Nemesis Games is a terrible
        idea.'
