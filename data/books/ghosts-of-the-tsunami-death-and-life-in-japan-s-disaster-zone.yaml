description: "<p>\n  <b>The definitive account of what happened, why, and above all\
  \ how it felt, when catastrophe hit Japan\u2014by the Japan correspondent of <i>The\
  \ Times</i> (London) and author of <i>People Who Eat Darkness</i></b>\n</p><p>On\
  \ March 11, 2011, a powerful earthquake sent a 120-foot-high tsunami smashing into\
  \ the coast of northeast Japan. By the time the sea retreated, more than eighteen\
  \ thousand people had been crushed, burned to death, or drowned.</p><p>It was Japan\u2019\
  s greatest single loss of life since the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. It set off\
  \ a national crisis and the meltdown of a nuclear power plant. And even after the\
  \ immediate emergency had abated, the trauma of the disaster continued to express\
  \ itself in bizarre and mysterious ways.</p><p>Richard Lloyd Parry, an award-winning\
  \ foreign correspondent, lived through the earthquake in Tokyo and spent six years\
  \ reporting from the disaster zone. There he encountered stories of ghosts and hauntings,\
  \ and met a priest who exorcised the spirits of the dead. And he found himself drawn\
  \ back again and again to a village that had suffered the greatest loss of all,\
  \ a community tormented by unbearable mysteries of its own. </p><p>What really happened\
  \ to the local children as they waited in the schoolyard in the moments before the\
  \ tsunami? Why did their teachers not evacuate them to safety? And why was the unbearable\
  \ truth being so stubbornly covered up?</p><p><i>Ghosts of the Tsunami</i> is a\
  \ soon-to-be classic intimate account of an epic tragedy, told through the accounts\
  \ of those who lived through it. It tells the story of how a nation faced a catastrophe,\
  \ and the struggle to find consolation in the ruins.</p>"
