description: "<b>The story of the idealists, technologists, and opportunists fighting\
  \ to bring cryptocurrency to the masses.</b><b>\n  <br />\n</b>In their short history,\
  \ Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gone through booms, busts, and internecine\
  \ wars. Yet today they are very much still with us: Bitcoin currently trades for\
  \ almost $10,000, the value of all crypto assets is greater than $250 billion. The\
  \ central promise of crypto is too good to pass up-vast un-taxable fortunes made\
  \ from decentralized networks not controlled by any single entity. <br /><br />Yet\
  \ cryptocurrency was growing increasingly marginal until a brilliant new idea changed\
  \ its fortunes once again: Ethereum. In this book, Laura Shin takes readers inside\
  \ the creation of this new form of cryptocurrency network, which enabled users to\
  \ launch their own new coins, and in so doing, created a new crypto fever. You'll\
  \ meet people like Vitalik Buterin, the wunderkind whose idea quickly became a $20\
  \ billion empire; Charles Hoskinson, the initial CEO who left the project within\
  \ five months; and Joe Lubin, a former Goldman Sachs VP whose early involvement\
  \ in Bitcoin and Ethereum helped him become one of crypto's most well-known billionaires.\
  \ Sparks flew as these outsized personalities fought for their piece of a seemingly\
  \ limitless new business opportunity. <br /><br />The fortunes of crypto continue\
  \ to rise and fall, but the people fighting to take it mainstream are making and\
  \ losing fortunes and careers on it. This fascinating book shows the crypto market\
  \ for what it really is: a deeply personal struggle for a revolution that may come\
  \ tomorrow, or not at all."
