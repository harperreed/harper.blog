  \ thriller about the rise and fall of Ross Ulbricht, aka the Dread Pirate Roberts,\
  \ the founder of the online black market Silk Road.<br /> \_<br /> \_\_\_\_ In <i>Hatching\
  \ Twitter</i>, Nick Bilton gave readers an astonishingly reported, riveting, and\

  \ of Twitter. Now Bilton turns his investigative journalism to the story of Ross\
  \ Ulbricht, the notorious and enigmatic founder of a drug empire called Silk Road.<br\
  \ /> \_<br /> \_\_\_\_ In 2011, Ulbricht, a 26-year-old libertarian idealist and\
  \ former Boy Scout, launched \"a website where people could buy anything anonymously,\
  \ with no trail whatsoever that could lead back to them.\" He called it Silk Road,\
  \ opened for business on the Dark Web, and christened himself the Dread Pirate Roberts\
  \ (after the <i>Princess Bride</i> character). The site grew at a tremendous pace,\
  \ quickly becoming a $1.2 billion enterprise where you could buy or sell drugs,\
