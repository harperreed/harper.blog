description: "Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to\
  \ attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to\
  \ the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most\
  \ remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought\
  \ of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed\
  \ was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes\
  \ flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to\
  \ have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.<br /><br />Forty years earlier,\
  \ a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like\
  \ a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable\
  \ ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible\
  \ to a little boy. And Lettie\u2014magical, comforting, wise beyond her years\u2014\
  promised to protect him, no matter what.<br /><br />A groundbreaking work from a\
  \ master, <i>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</i> is told with a rare understanding\
  \ of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter\
  \ us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac\
  \ fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark."
