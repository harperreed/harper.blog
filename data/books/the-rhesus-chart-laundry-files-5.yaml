  \ organization responsible for protecting Britain against supernatural threats\u2014\
  Bob Howard is expected to show some initiative to help the agency battle the forces\
  \ of darkness. But shining a light on things best left in the shadows is the last\
  \ thing Bob wants to do\u2014especially when those shadows hide an occult parasite\
  \ spreading a deadly virus.<br /><br /> Traders employed by a merchant bank in London\
  \ are showing signs of infection\u2014an array of unusual symptoms such as superstrength\
  \ and -speed, an uncanny talent for mind control, an extreme allergic reaction to\
  \ sunlight, and an unquenchable thirst for blood. While his department is tangled\
  \ up in bureaucratic red tape (and <i>Buffy</i> reruns), debating how to stop the\
  \ rash of vampirism, Bob digs deeper into the bank\u2019s history\u2014only to uncover\
  \ a bloodcurdling conspiracy between men and monsters...<br /><br />"
