  \ The Gethenians can become male or female during each mating cycle, and this is\
  \ something that humans find incomprehensible.<br /><br />The Ekumen of Known Worlds\
  \ has sent an ethnologist to study the Gethenians on their forbidding, ice-bound\
  \ world. At first he finds his subjects difficult and off-putting, with their elaborate\
  \ social systems and alien minds. But in the course of a long journey across the\
  \ ice, he reaches an understanding with one of the Gethenians \u2014 it might even\
  \ be a kind of love"
