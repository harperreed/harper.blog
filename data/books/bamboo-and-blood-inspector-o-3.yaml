description: "<div>\n  <div>\n    <p>The critically acclaimed <i>A Corpse in the Koryo\
  \ </i>brought readers into the enigmatic workings of North Korean intelligence with\
  \ the introduction of a new kind of detective---the mysterious Inspector O. In the\
  \ follow-up, <i>Hidden Moon,</i> O threaded his way through the minefield of North\
  \ Korean ministries into a larger conspiracy he was never supposed to touch.<br\
  \ /><br />Now the inspector returns . . .<br /><br />In the winter of 1997, trying\
  \ to stay alive during a famine that has devastated much of North Korea, Inspector\
  \ O is ordered to play host to an Israeli agent who appears in Pyongyang. When the\
  \ wife of a North Korean diplomat in Pakistan dies under suspicious circumstances,\
  \ O is told to investigate, with a curious proviso: Don\xE2\u20AC\u2122t look too\
  \ closely at the details, and stay away from the question of missiles. O knows he\
  \ can\xE2\u20AC\u2122t avoid finding out what he is supposed to ignore on a trail\
  \ that leads him from the dark, chilly rooms of Pyongyang to an abandoned secret\
  \ facility deep in the countryside, guarded by a lonely general; and from the streets\
  \ of New York to a bench beneath a horse chestnut tree on the shores of Lake Geneva,\
  \ where the Inspector discovers he is up to his ears in missiles---and worse. Stalked\
  \ by the past and wary of the future, O is convinced there is no one he can trust,\
  \ and no one he can\xE2\u20AC\u2122t suspect. Swiss intelligence wants him out of\
  \ the country; someone else wants him dead.<br /><br />Once again, James Church\xE2\
  \u20AC\u2122s spare, lyrical prose guides readers through an unfamiliar landscape\
  \ of whispered words and shadows, a world wrapped in a level of mystery and complexity\
  \ that few outsiders have experienced. With Inspector O, noir has a new home in\
  \ North Korea, and James Church holds the keys.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>"
