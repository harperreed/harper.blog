description: Two hundred and seventy-four years after the fall of the WorldWeb in
  Fall of Hyperion, Raul Endymion is sent on a quest. Retrieving Aenea from the Sphinx
  before the Church troops reach her is only the beginning. With help from a blue-skinned
  android named A. Bettik, Raul and Aenea travel the river Tethys, pursued by Father
  Captain Frederico DeSoya, an influential warrior-priest and his troops. The shrike
  continues to make enigmatic appearances, and while many questions were raised in
  Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion, still more are raised here. Raul's quest will continue.
