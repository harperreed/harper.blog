description: Kevin David Mitnick was cyberspace's most wanted hacker. Mitnick could
  launch missiles or cripple the world's financial markets with a single phone call
  - or so went the myth. The FBI, phone companies, bounty hunters, even fellow hackers
  pursued him over the Internet and through cellular airways. But while Mitnick's
  alleged crimes have been widely publicized, his story has never been told. Now Jonathan
  Littman takes us into the mind of a serial hacker. Drawing on over fifty hours of
  telephone conversations with Mitnick on the run, Littman reveals Mitnick's double
  life; his narrow escapes; his new identities, complete with college degrees of his
  choosing; his hacking techniques and mastery of "social engineering"; his obsession
  with revenge.
