description: "CIA case officer Sam Joseph is dispatched to Paris to recruit Syrian\
  \ Palace official Mariam Haddad. The two fall into a forbidden relationship, supercharging\
  \ Haddad\u2019s recruitment and creating unspeakable danger when they enter Damascus\
  \ to find the man responsible for the disappearance of an American spy.<br /><br\
  \ />But the cat-and-mouse chase for the killer soon leads to a trail of high-profile\
  \ assassinations and the discovery of a dark secret at the heart of the Syrian regime,\
  \ bringing the pair under the all-seeing eyes of Asad\u2019s spycatcher, Ali Hassan,\
  \ and his brother Rustum, the head of the feared Republican Guard. Set against the\
  \ backdrop of a Syria pulsing with fear and rebellion, <em>Damascus Station\_</em>is\
  \ a pulse-pounding thriller that offers a textured portrayal of espionage, love,\
  \ loyalty, and betrayal in one of the most difficult CIA assignments on the planet."
