description: "Edward Snowden, the man who risked everything to expose the US government\u2019\
  s system of mass surveillance, reveals for the first time the story of his life,\
  \ including how he helped to build that system and what motivated him to try to\
  \ bring it down.<br /><b></b><br />In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden\
  \ shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and\
  \ revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to\
  \ collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be\
  \ an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the\
  \ private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the\
  \ very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose\
  \ it.<br /><br />Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine\
  \ CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, <i>Permanent Record </i>is the extraordinary\
  \ account of a bright young man who grew up online\u2014a man who became a spy,\
  \ a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet\u2019s conscience."
