description: "\u201CIf you ever met a god,\u201D she said, \u201Cthe only rational\
  \ course of action would be to kill it as quickly as possible.\u201D<br /><br />Cassandra\
  \ travels on airplanes for a living, but now airplanes have begun to follow her.\
  \ A state-of-the-art spy plane with no official owner circles over every city she\
  \ visits. A darkened fighter jet lurks off the wing of her red-eye flight into Reno.\
  \ On the ground, the surveillance apparatus of modern life seems to be taking a\
  \ peculiar, specific interest in her.<br /><br />A reclusive computer hacker, recently\
  \ fired from an agency without a name, summons Cassandra to a meeting in the middle\
  \ of nowhere to share an urgent message: Something more than human has been growing\
  \ in the cracks of our world, and it might not remain ours much longer\u2026<br\
  \ /><br />Airplane Mode is a tense and disorienting work of present-day science\
  \ fiction, set in the nowhere land of air travel and the everywhere land of ubiquitous\
  \ surveillance, that explores the darker contours of the technological world we've\
  \ created and speculates about how it might end."
