description: "<b>From FSGO x <i>Logic</i>: stories about rural China, food, and tech\
  \ that reveal new truths about the globalized world</b><br /><b></b><br /><b></b>In\
  \ <i>Blockchain Chicken Farm</i>, the technologist and writer Xiaowei Wang explores\
  \ the political and social entanglements of technology in rural China. Her discoveries\
  \ force her to challenge the standard idea that rural culture and people are backward,\
  \ conservative, and intolerant. Instead, she finds that rural China has not only\
  \ adapted to rapid globalization but has actually innovated the technology we all\
  \ use today. From pork farmers using AI to produce the perfect pig, to disruptive\
  \ luxury counterfeits and the political intersections of e-commerce villages, Wang\
  \ unravels the ties between globalization, technology, agriculture, and commerce\
  \ in unprecedented fashion. Accompanied by humorous \u201CSinofuturist\u201D recipes\
  \ that frame meals as they transform under new technology, <i>Blockchain Chicken\
  \ Farm</i> is an original and probing look into innovation, connectivity, and collaboration\
  \ in the digitized rural world."
