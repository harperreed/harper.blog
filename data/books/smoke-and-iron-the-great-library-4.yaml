description: <b>To save the Great Library, the unforgettable characters from <i>Ink
  and Bone</i>, <i>Paper and Fire, </i>and<i> Ash and Quill </i>put themselves in
  danger in the next thrilling adventure in the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling
  series.</b><br /><br />The opening moves of a deadly game have begun. Jess Brightwell
  has put himself in direct peril, with only his wits and skill to aid him in a game
  of cat and mouse with the Archivist Magister of the Great Library. With the world
  catching fire, and words printed on paper the spark that lights rebellion, it falls
  to smugglers, thieves, and scholars to save a library thousands of years in the
  making...if they can stay alive long enough to outwit their enemies.
