description: "The critically acclaimed cult novelist makes visceral the terrors of\
  \ life in Jim Crow America and its lingering effects in this brilliant and wondrous\
  \ work of the imagination that melds historical fiction, pulp noir, and Lovecraftian\
  \ horror and fantasy<br /><br />Chicago, 1954. When his father Montrose goes missing,\
  \ twenty-two year old Army veteran Atticus Turner embarks on a road trip to New\
  \ England to find him, accompanied by his Uncle George\u2014publisher of The Safe\
  \ Negro Travel Guide\u2014and his childhood friend Letitia. On their journey to\
  \ the manor of Mr. Braithwhite\u2014heir to the estate that owned Atticus\u2019\
  s great grandmother\u2014they encounter both mundane terrors of white America and\
  \ malevolent spirits that seem straight out of the weird tales George devours.<br\
  \ /><br />At the manor, Atticus discovers his father in chains, held prisoner by\
  \ a secret cabal named the Order of the Ancient Dawn\u2014led by Samuel Braithwhite\
  \ and his son Caleb\u2014which has gathered to orchestrate a ritual that shockingly\
  \ centers on Atticus. And his one hope of salvation may be the seed of his\u2014\
  and the whole Turner clan\u2019s\u2014destruction.<br /><br />A chimerical blend\
  \ of magic, power, hope, and freedom that stretches across time, touching diverse\
  \ members of one black family, Lovecraft Country is a devastating kaleidoscopic\
  \ portrait of racism\u2014the terrifying specter that continues to haunt us today."
