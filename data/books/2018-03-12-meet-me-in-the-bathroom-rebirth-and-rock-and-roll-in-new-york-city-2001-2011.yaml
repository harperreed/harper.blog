description: "An intriguing oral history of the post-9/11 decline of the old-guard\
  \ music industry and rebirth of the New York rock scene, led by a group of iconoclastic\
  \ rock bands.<br /><br />In the second half of the twentieth-century New York was\
  \ the source of new sounds, including the Greenwich Village folk scene, punk and\
  \ new wave, and hip-hop. But as the end of the millennium neared, cutting-edge bands\
  \ began emerging from Seattle, Austin, and London, pushing New York further from\
  \ the epicenter. The behemoth music industry, too, found itself in free fall, under\
  \ siege from technology. Then 9/11/2001 plunged the country into a state of uncertainty\
  \ and war\u2014and a dozen New York City bands that had been honing their sound\
  \ and style in relative obscurity suddenly became symbols of glamour for a young,\
  \ web-savvy, forward-looking generation in need of an anthem.<br /><br /><em>Meet\
  \ Me in the Bathroom</em> charts the transformation of the New York music scene\
  \ in the first decade of the 2000s, the bands behind it\u2014including The Strokes,\
  \ The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, LCD Soundsystem, Interpol, and Vampire Weekend\u2014and the\
  \ cultural forces that shaped it, from the Internet to a booming real estate market\
  \ that forced artists out of the Lower East Side to Williamsburg. Drawing on 200\
  \ original interviews with James Murphy, Julian Casablancas, Karen O, Ezra Koenig,\
  \ and many others musicians, artists, journalists, bloggers, photographers, managers,\
  \ music executives, groupies, models, movie stars, and DJs who lived through this\
  \ explosive time, journalist Lizzy Goodman offers a fascinating portrait of a time\
  \ and a place that gave birth to a new era in modern rock-and-roll."
