description: "<b>A real-life technological thriller about a band of eccentric misfits\
  \ taking on the biggest cybersecurity threats of our time. </b><br /><br />Scattered\
  \ across the world, an elite team of code-cracking techies is working tirelessly\
  \ on your behalf to thwart the most notorious cyber scourge of our time. You\u2019\
  ve probably never heard of them. But if you work for a school, a business, a hospital,\
  \ or a municipal government, especially if its cybersecurity is imperfect, chances\
  \ are that you\u2019re painfully familiar with the group\u2019s sworn enemy: ransomware.\
  \ Again and again, these ordinary people, mostly self-taught and often struggling\
  \ to make ends meet, have outwitted the shadowy networks of hackers and criminal\
  \ gangs that lock computer networks and extort huge payments in return for the key.<br\
  \ /><br /><i>The Ransomware Hunting Team<i></i> is the incredible true story of\
  \ a band of misfits who have used their extraordinary skills to save millions of\
  \ ransomware victims from paying billions of dollars to criminals. Working in their\
  \ free time from bedrooms and back offices, they offer their services pro bono to\
  \ those whom the FBI, other government agencies, and the private sector are unwilling\
  \ or unable to help. This book follows the teammates as they respond to dire calls\
  \ for help\u2014and tracks the ups and downs of their work as they race to rescue\
  \ precious files and communicate directly with their adversaries. Urgent, uplifting,\
  \ and entertaining, Renee Dudley and Daniel Golden\u2019s <i>The Ransomware Hunting\
  \ Team</i> is a real-life technological thriller set in a dangerous new era of cybercrime.</i>"
