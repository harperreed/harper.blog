description: '<b>In this exhilarating novel by the best-selling author of <i>The Storied
  Life of A. J. Fikry</i> two friends--often in love, but never lovers--come together
  as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them
  fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality.</b><br /><br
  />On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur
  exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform,
  Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn''t heard him,
  but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch
  them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors,
  and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster,
  <i> Ichigo</i>. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old,
  Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won''t protect
  them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.<br /><br
  />Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California,
  and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin''s <i>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,
  and Tomorrow</i> is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the
  multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities
  in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is
  a love story, but it is not one you have read before.'
