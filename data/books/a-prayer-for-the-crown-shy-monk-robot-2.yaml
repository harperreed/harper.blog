description: 'After touring the rural areas of Panga, Sibling Dex (a Tea Monk of some
  renown) and Mosscap (a robot sent on a quest to determine what humanity really needs)
  turn their attention to the villages and cities of the little moon they call home.<br
  /><br />They hope to find the answers they seek, while making new friends, learning
  new concepts, and experiencing the entropic nature of the universe.<br /><br />Becky
  Chambers''s new series continues to ask: in a world where people have what they
  want, does having more even matter?<br /><br />They''re going to need to ask it
  a lot.'

        \ a delightful sci-fi series that gives readers hope for the future. In A\
        \ Psalm for the Wild-Built, the first book in this philosophically adventurous\
        \ series, the robots of Panga have long ago achieved self-awareness and retreated\
        \ into the forests, where they\u2019ve become the stuff of legends and myth.\
        \ However, when a robot checks in on a tea monk one day, honoring its ancient\
        \ duty, it cannot leave until the monk answers the simple question: \u201C\
        What do you need?\u201D \r\n    \r\n    \u201CFans of gentle, smart, and hopeful\
        \ science fiction will delight in this promising series starter.\u201D \u2014\
