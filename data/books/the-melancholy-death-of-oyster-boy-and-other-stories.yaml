description: "From breathtaking stop-action animation to bittersweet modern fairy\
  \ tales, filmmaker <b>Tim Burton</b> has become known for his unique visual brilliance\
  \ \u2013 witty and macabre at once. Now he gives birth to a cast of gruesomely sympathetic\
  \ children \u2013 misunderstood outcasts who struggle to find love and belonging\
  \ in their cruel, cruel worlds. His lovingly lurid illustrations evoke both the\
  \ sweetness and the tragedy of these dark yet simple beings \u2013 hopeful, hapless\
  \ heroes who appeal to the ugly outsider in all of us, and let us laugh at a world\
  \ we have long left behind (mostly anyway)."
