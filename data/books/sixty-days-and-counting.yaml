description: "By the time Phil Chase is elected president, the world\u2019s climate\
  \ is far on its way to irreversible change. Food scarcity, housing shortages, diminishing\
  \ medical care, and vanishing species are just some of the consequences. The erratic\
  \ winter the Washington, D.C., area is experiencing is another grim reminder of\
  \ a global weather pattern gone haywire: bone-chilling cold one day, balmy weather\
  \ the next.<br /><br />But the president-elect remains optimistic and doesn\u2019\
  t intend to give up without a fight. A maverick in every sense of the word, Chase\
  \ starts organizing the most ambitious plan to save the world from disaster since\
  \ FDR\u2013and assembling a team of top scientists and advisers to implement it.<br\
  \ /><br />For Charlie Quibler, this means reentering the political fray full-time\
  \ and giving up full-time care of his young son, Joe. For Frank Vanderwal, hampered\
  \ by a brain injury, it means trying to protect the woman he loves from a vengeful\
  \ ex and a rogue \u201Cblack ops\u201D agency not even the president can control\u2013\
  a task for which neither Frank\u2019s work at the National Science Foundation nor\
  \ his study of Tibetan Buddhism can prepare him. <br /><br />In a world where time\
  \ is running out as quickly as its natural resources, where surveillance is almost\
  \ total and freedom nearly nonexistent, the forecast for the Chase administration\
  \ looks darker each passing day. For as the last\u2013and most terrible\u2013of\
  \ natural disasters looms on the horizon, it will take a miracle to stop the clock\
  \ . . . the kind of miracle that only dedicated men and women can bring about.<br\
  \ /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"
