description: "Challenging every preconception about storytelling and prose style,\
  \ mixing wry humor and riveting emotional depth, Kawakami is today one of Japan\u2019\
  s most important and best-selling writers. She exploded onto the cultural scene\
  \ first as a musician, then as a poet and popular blogger, and is now an award-winning\
  \ novelist.<br /><br /><i>Breasts and Eggs</i> paints a portrait of contemporary\
  \ womanhood in Japan and recounts the intimate journeys of three women as they confront\
  \ oppressive mores and their own uncertainties on the road to finding peace and\
  \ futures they can truly call their own.<br /><br />It tells the story of three\
  \ women: the thirty-year-old Natsu, her older sister, Makiko, and Makiko\u2019s\
  \ daughter, Midoriko. Makiko has traveled to Tokyo in search of an affordable breast\
  \ enhancement procedure. She is accompanied by Midoriko, who has recently grown\
  \ silent, finding herself unable to voice the vague yet overwhelming pressures associated\
  \ with growing up. Her silence proves a catalyst for each woman to confront her\
  \ fears and frustrations.<br /><br />On another hot summer\u2019s day ten years\
  \ later, Natsu, on a journey back to her native city, struggles with her own indeterminate\
  \ identity as she confronts anxieties about growing old alone and childless."
