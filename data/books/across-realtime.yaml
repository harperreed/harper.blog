description: Previously published in three parts, The Peace War, Marooned in Realtime,
  and The Ungoverned, this is a marvelous extrapolative tale, to which no summary
  can do justice, with a gripping blend of high-tech razzle-dazzle and good old-fashioned
  murder mystery--all spiced with . . . the time-travel theme.--Kirkus Review.

        \ force-field impenetrable by any force known to mankind. Encasing governmental\
        \ installations and military bases in bobbles, the Peace Authority has taken\
        \ over the world and becomes virtually omnipotent. The Peace War and its sequel,\
        \ Marooned in Realtime, explore the power such a technology could give to\
        \ those who control it\u2014and what that means for the fate of humanity.\
        \ \r\n    \r\n    Between book 1 and 2 there is \"The Ungoverned\", which\
        \ was a novella published in his collection True Names and Other Dangers which\
