description: "Malcolm Polstead is the kind of boy who notices everything but is not\
  \ much noticed himself. And so perhaps it was inevitable that he would become a\
  \ spy....<br /><br />Malcolm's parents run an inn called the Trout, on the banks\
  \ of the river Thames, and all of Oxford passes through its doors. Malcolm and his\
  \ daemon, Asta, routinely overhear news and gossip, and the occasional scandal,\
  \ but during a winter of unceasing rain, Malcolm catches wind of something new:\
  \ intrigue. <br /><br />He finds a secret message inquiring about a dangerous substance\
  \ called Dust\u2014and the spy it was intended for finds him. <br /><br />When she\
  \ asks Malcolm to keep his eyes open, he sees suspicious characters everywhere:\
  \ the explorer Lord Asriel, clearly on the run; enforcement agents from the Magisterium;\
  \ a gyptian named Coram with warnings just for Malcolm; and a beautiful woman with\
  \ an evil monkey for a daemon. All are asking about the same thing: a girl\u2014\
  just a baby\u2014named Lyra.<br /><br />Lyra is the kind of person who draws people\
  \ in like magnets. And Malcolm will brave any danger, and make shocking sacrifices,\
  \ to bring her safely through the storm."
