description: 'There''s a reason they say "be careful what you wish for." Just ask
  the girl who wished to be thinner and ended up smaller than Thumbelina, or the boy
  who asked for "balls of steel" and got them-literally. And never wish for your party
  to go on forever. Not unless you want your guests to be struck down by debilitating
  pain if they try to leave.<br /><br /><br />These are things Lennie only learns
  when it''s too late-after she brings some of her uncles'' moonshine to a party and
  toasts to dozens of wishes, including a big wish of her own: to bring back her best
  friend, Dylan, who was abducted and murdered six months ago.<br /><br />Lennie didn''t
  mean to cause so much chaos. She always thought her uncles'' moonshine toast was
  just a tradition. And when they talked about carrying on their "important family
  legacy," she thought they meant good old-fashioned bootlegging.<br /><br />As it
  turns out, they meant granting wishes. And Lennie has just granted more in one night
  than her uncles would grant in a year.<br /><br />Now she has to find a way to undo
  the damage. But once granted, a wish can''t be unmade...'
