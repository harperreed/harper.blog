description: "Yielding to a compulsion he can\u2019t explain, Ted Barton interrupts\
  \ his vacation in order to visit the town of his birth, Millgate, Virginia. But\
  \ upon entering the sleepy, isolated little hamlet, Ted is distraught to find that\
  \ the place bears no resemblance to the one he left behind\u2014and never did. He\
  \ also discovers that in this Millgate Ted Barton died of scarlet fever when he\
  \ was nine years old. Perhaps even more troubling is the fact that it is literally\
  \ impossible to escape. Unable to leave, Ted struggles to find the reason for such\
  \ disturbing incongruities, but before long, he finds himself in the midst of a\
  \ struggle between good and evil that stretches far beyond the confines of the valley.<br\
  \ /><br />Winner of both the Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely\
  \ regarded as the premiere science fiction writer of his day, and the object of\
  \ cult-like adoration from his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen\
  \ in a literary light that defies classification in much the same way as Borges\
  \ and Calvino. With breathtaking insight, he utilizes vividly unfamiliar worlds\
  \ to evoke the hauntingly and hilariously familiar in our society and ourselves.<br\
  \ /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>"
