description: 'John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his
  wife''s grave. Then he joined the army.<br /><br />The good news is that humanity
  finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live
  on are scarce-- and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we
  fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far
  from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.<br
  /><br />Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity''s resources are in the
  hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement
  age, you can join the CDF. They don''t want young people; they want people who carry
  the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You''ll be taken off Earth and never
  allowed to return. You''ll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you''ll
  be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.<br
  /><br />John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect.
  Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can
  imagine--and what he will become is far stranger.'

      description: "<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author John Scalzi takes you\
        \ on an epic romp of galactic conquest and exploration in the Old Man's War\
        \ series. Humanity has reached the stars, but have been engaged in wars with\
        \ alien races for decades over habitable planets. The Colonial Defense Force\
        \ fights for Earth. To join the CDF, a recruit must have reached retirement\
        \ age. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge\
        \ and skills of decades of living. Soldiers are taken off Earth and never\
        \ allowed to return. They'll serve time at the front. And if they survive,\
        \ they'll be given a generous homestead on one of Earth's hard-won colony\
        \ planets.\n    \n    \n    Old Man\u2019s War, The Last Colony and Zoe\u2019\
        s Tale were each nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in their respective\
        \ years. Zoe\u2019s Tale was additionally nominated for the Andre Norton Award\
        \ for Best Young Adult Science Fiction/Fantasy. The Ghost Brigades was nominated\
        \ for the Prometheus Award. Old Man\u2019s War was the winner of the Geffen\
        \ Award in Israel; The Last Colony the recipient of the Seiun Award in Japan.\n\
        \    \n    Old Man\u2019s War was ranked #1 on the Tor.com reader poll of\
        \ the best science fiction and fantasy novels of 2000 \u2013 2010. It is listed\
        \ on the NPR.com reader poll of the Top 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy Books/Series."
