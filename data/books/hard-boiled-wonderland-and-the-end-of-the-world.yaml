description: '''A narrative particle accelerator that zooms between Wild Turkey Whiskey
  and Bob Dylan, unicorn skulls and voracious librarians, John Coltrane and <i>Lord
  Jim</i>. Science fiction, detective story and post-modern manifesto all rolled into
  one rip-roaring novel, <i>Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World</i> is
  the tour de force that expanded Haruki Murakami''s international following. Tracking
  one man''s descent into the Kafkaesque underworld of contemporary Tokyo, Murakami
  unites East and West, tragedy and farce, compassion and detachment, slang and philosophy.'''
