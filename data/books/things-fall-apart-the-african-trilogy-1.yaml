description: <i>Things Fall Apart</i> is the first of three novels in Chinua Achebe's
  critically acclaimed African Trilogy. It is a classic narrative about Africa's cataclysmic
  encounter with Europe as it establishes a colonial presence on the continent. Told
  through the fictional experiences of Okonkwo, a wealthy and fearless Igbo warrior
  of Umuofia in the late 1800s, <i>Things Fall Apart </i>explores one man's futile
  resistance to the devaluing of his Igbo traditions by British political andreligious
  forces and his despair as his community capitulates to the powerful new order.<br
  /><br /> With more than 20 million copies sold and translated into fifty-seven languages,
  <i>Things Fall Apart </i>provides one of the most illuminating and permanent monuments
  to African experience. Achebe does not only capture life in a pre-colonial African
  village, he conveys the tragedy of the loss of that world while broadening our understanding
  of our contemporary realities.
