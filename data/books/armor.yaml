description: "The planet is called Banshee. The air is unbreathable, the water poisonous.\
  \ It is the home of the most implacable enemies that humanity, in all its interstellar\
  \ expansion, has ever encountered.<br /><br />Felix is a scout in A-team Two. Highly\
  \ competent, he is the sole survivor of mission after mission. Yet he is a man consumed\
  \ by fear and hatred. And he is protected not only by his custom-fitted body armor,\
  \ the culmination of 10,000 years of the armorers' craft, but also by an odd being\
  \ which seems to live with him, a cold killing machine he calls \"the Engine.\"\
  <br /><br />\xA91984 John Steakley; (P)2009 Blackstone Audio, Inc."
