description: The time of reckoning has arrived. As a final genocidal Crusade threatens
  to enslave humanity forever, a new messiah has come of age. She is Aenea and she
  has undergone a strange apprenticeship to those known as the Others. Now her protector,
  Raul Endymion, one-time shepherd and convicted murderer, must help her deliver her
  startling message to her growing army of disciples. <br /><br />But first they must
  embark on a final spectacular mission to discover the underlying meaning of the
  universe itself. They have been followed on their journey by the mysterious Shrike--monster,
  angel, killing machine--who is about to reveal the long-held secret of its origin
  and purpose. And on the planet of Hyperion, where the story first began, the final
  revelation will be delivered--an apocalyptic message that unlocks the secrets of
  existence and the fate of humankind in the galaxy.
