description: "The sixth novel of the galaxy-spanning Sun Eater series merges the best\
  \ of space opera and epic fantasy, as Hadrian Marlowe continues down a path that\
  \ can only end in fire.<br /><br />The end is nigh.<br /><br />It has been nearly\
  \ two hundred years since Hadrian Marlowe assaulted the person of the Emperor and\
  \ walked away from war. From his Empire. His duty. From the will and service of\
  \ the eldritch being known only as the Quiet. The galaxy lies in the grip of a terrible\
  \ plague, and worse, the Cielcin have overrun the realms of men.<br /><br />A messenger\
  \ has come to Jadd, bearing a summons from the Sollan Emperor for the one-time hero.\
  \ A summons, a pardon, and a plea. HAPSIS, the Emperor\u2019s secret first-contact\
  \ intelligence organization, has located one of the dreadful Watchers, the immense,\
  \ powerful beings worshipped by the Pale Cielcin.<br /><br />Called out of retirement\
  \ and exile, the old hero\u2014accompanied by his daughter, Cassandra\u2014must\
  \ race across the galaxy and against time to accomplish one last, impossible <br\
  \ /><br />To kill a god."
