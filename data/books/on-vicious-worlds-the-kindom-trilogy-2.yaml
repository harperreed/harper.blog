description: "One of the most exciting new voices in space opera returns with the\
  \ thrilling sequel to <i>These Burning Stars</i>, the explosive space opera debut\
  \ that launched the dangerous cat\u2011and\u2011mouse quest for revenge that will\
  \ define a people forever.<br /><br /> The Jeveni have finally found freedom on\
  \ the distant planet Capamame, delivered from Kindom oppression through their alliance\
  \ with stoic Cleric Chono, intrepid caster Jun Ironway, and Six, the wildly unpredictable\
  \ manipulator who has outwitted the Nightfoot family.<br /><br />But when Six and\
  \ Chono return to the Treble star systems, the dream of freedom meets a dangerous\
  \ test. The Secretaries of the Kindom are intent on reclaiming power in the Treble,\
  \ as well as control over the Jeveni. Meanwhile, Jun Ironway and Jeveni collector\
  \ Masar Hawks struggle to protect Capamame from a population brimming with resentment,\
  \ not to mention a faceless saboteur spreading mayhem and murder. \_ As the two\
  \ groups struggle to outwit their enemies, divergent battles wend toward a climatic\
  \ reunion that will spark a revolution. But over it all hangs the cruel legacy of\
  \ Esek Nightfoot, whose rippling effects may prove impossible to survive."
