description: "<b>From the bestselling author of <i>Ohio</i>, a masterful American\
  \ epic charting a near future approaching collapse and a nascent but strengthening\
  \ solidarity.</b><br /><br />In the first decades of the 21st century, the world\
  \ is convulsing, its governments mired in gridlock while a patient but unrelenting\
  \ ecological crisis looms. America is in upheaval, battered by violent weather and\
  \ extreme politics. In California in 2013, Tony Pietrus, a scientist studying deposits\
  \ of undersea methane, receives a death threat. His fate will become bound to a\
  \ stunning cast of characters\u2014a broken drug addict, a star advertising strategist,\
  \ a neurodivergent mathematician, a cunning eco-terrorist, an actor turned religious\
  \ zealot, and a brazen young activist named Kate Morris, who, in the mountains of\
  \ Wyoming, begins a project that will alter the course of the decades to come.<br\
  \ /> <br />From the Gulf Coast to Los Angeles, the Midwest to Washington, DC, their\
  \ intertwined odysseys unfold against a stark backdrop of accelerating chaos as\
  \ they summon courage, galvanize a nation, fall to their own fear, and find wild\
  \ hope in the face of staggering odds. As their stories hurtle toward a spectacular\
  \ climax, each faces a reckoning: what will they sacrifice to salvage humanity\u2019\
  s last chance at a future? A singular achievement, <i>The Deluge</i> is a once-in-a-generation\
  \ novel that meets the moment as few works of art ever have."
