description: "<b>Saving the world is a test no school of magic can prepare you for\
  \ in the triumphant conclusion to the New York Times bestselling trilogy that began\
  \ with <i>A Deadly Education</i> and The Last Graduate.</b><br /><br />The one thing\
  \ you never talk about while you\u2019re in the Scholomance is what you\u2019ll\
  \ do when you get out. Not even the richest enclaver would tempt fate that way.\
  \ But it\u2019s all we dream about: the hideously slim chance we\u2019ll survive\
  \ to make it out the gates and improbably find ourselves with a life ahead of us,\
  \ a life outside the Scholomance halls.<br /><br />And now the impossible dream\
  \ has come true. I\u2019m out, we\u2019re <i>all</i> out\u2014and I didn\u2019t\
  \ even have to turn into a monstrous dark witch to make it happen. So much for my\
  \ great-grandmother\u2019s prophecy of doom and destruction. I didn\u2019t kill\
  \ enclavers, I <i>saved</i> them. Me and Orion and our allies. Our graduation plan\
  \ worked to perfection: We saved everyone and made the world safe for all wizards\
  \ and brought peace and harmony to all the enclaves everywhere.<br /><br />Ha, only\
  \ joking! Actually, it\u2019s gone all wrong. Someone else has picked up the project\
  \ of destroying enclaves in my stead, and probably everyone we saved is about to\
  \ get killed in the brewing enclave war. And the first thing I\u2019ve got to do\
  \ now, having miraculously gotten out of the Scholomance, is turn straight around\
  \ and find a way back in."
