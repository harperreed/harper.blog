description: "In this memoir, Litt brings us inside Obamaworld. With a humorists\u2019\
  \ eye for detail, he describes what it\u2019s like to accidentally trigger an international\
  \ incident or nearly set a president\u2019s hair aflame. He answers questions you\
  \ never knew you had: Which White House men\u2019s room is the classiest? What do\
  \ you do when the commander in chief gets your name wrong? Where should you never,\
  \ under any circumstances, change clothes on Air Force One? With nearly a decade\
  \ of stories to tell, Litt makes clear that politics is completely, hopelessly absurd.\_\
  \_\_<br /><br />But it\u2019s also important. For all the moments of chaos, frustration,\
  \ and yes, disillusionment, Litt remains a believer in the words that first drew\
  \ him to the Obama campaign: \u201CPeople who love this country can change it.\u201D\
  \ In telling his own story, Litt sheds fresh light on his former boss\u2019s legacy.\
  \ And he argues that, despite the current political climate, the politics championed\
  \ by Barack Obama will outlive the presidency of Donald Trump."
