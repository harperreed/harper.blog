description: "<b>An isolated mansion. A chillingly charismatic aristocrat. And a brave\
  \ socialite drawn to expose their treacherous secrets. . . . From the author of\
  \ <i>Gods of Jade and Shadow</i> comes \u201Ca terrifying twist on classic gothic\
  \ horror\u201D (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>) set in glamorous 1950s Mexico.</b><br /><br\
  \ />After receiving a frantic letter from her newly-wed cousin begging for someone\
  \ to save her from a mysterious doom, Noem\xED Taboada heads to High Place, a distant\
  \ house in the Mexican countryside. She\u2019s not sure what she will find\u2014\
  her cousin\u2019s husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noem\xED knows\
  \ little about the region. <br /> <br />Noem\xED is also an unlikely rescuer: She\u2019\
  s a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns and perfect red lipstick are more suited\
  \ for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. But she\u2019s also tough and smart,\
  \ with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not of her cousin\u2019s new\
  \ husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father, the ancient patriarch\
  \ who seems to be fascinated by Noem\xED; and not even of the house itself, which\
  \ begins to invade Noem\xED\u2019s dreams with visions of blood and doom.<br />\
  \ <br />Her only ally in this inhospitable abode is the family\u2019s youngest son.\
  \ Shy and gentle, he seems to want to help Noem\xED, but might also be hiding dark\
  \ knowledge of his family\u2019s past. For there are many secrets behind the walls\
  \ of High Place. The family\u2019s once colossal wealth and faded mining empire\
  \ kept them from prying eyes, but as Noem\xED digs deeper she unearths stories of\
  \ violence and madness. <br /> <br />And Noem\xED, mesmerized by the terrifying\
  \ yet seductive world of High Place, may soon find it impossible to ever leave this\
  \ enigmatic house behind."
