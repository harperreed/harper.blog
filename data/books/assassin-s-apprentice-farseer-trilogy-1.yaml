description: "Twenty-five years ago, Robin Hobb\u2019s first novel featuring FitzChivalry\
  \ Farseer and his mysterious, often maddening friend the Fool struck like a bolt\
  \ of brilliant lightning. Thus began a beloved saga spanning multiple series, full\
  \ of adventure, magic, and sinister plots. To celebrate a quarter-century of wonder,\
  \ this special edition of <i>Assassin\u2019s Apprentice</i> presents a modern classic\
  \ as it\u2019s never been seen before: in hardcover, with ten beautiful illustrations\
  \ by Magali Villeneuve.<br /><br /> Young Fitz is the bastard son of the noble Prince\
  \ Chivalry, raised in the shadow of the royal court by his father\u2019s gruff stableman.\
  \ He is treated as an outcast by all the royalty except the devious King Shrewd,\
  \ who has him secretly tutored in the arts of the assassin. For in Fitz\u2019s blood\
  \ runs the magic Skill\u2014and the darker knowledge of a child raised with the\
  \ stable hounds and rejected by his family.<br /><br /> As barbarous raiders ravage\
  \ the coasts, Fitz is growing to manhood. Soon he will face his first dangerous,\
  \ soul-shattering mission. And though some regard him as a threat to the throne,\
  \ he may just be the key to the survival of the kingdom."
