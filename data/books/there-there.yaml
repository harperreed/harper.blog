description: '<b>Tommy Orange''s wondrous and shattering novel follows twelve characters
  from Native communities: all traveling to the Big Oakland Powwow, all connected
  to one another in ways they may not yet realize.</b><br /><br />Among them is Jacquie
  Red Feather, newly sober and trying to make it back to the family she left behind.
  Dene Oxendene, pulling his life together after his uncle''s death and working at
  the powwow to honor his memory. Fourteen-year-old Orvil, coming to perform traditional
  dance for the very first time. Together, this chorus of voices tells of the plight
  of the urban Native American--grappling with a complex and painful history, with
  an inheritance of beauty and spirituality, with communion and sacrifice and heroism.
  <br /><br />Hailed as an instant classic, <i>There There</i> is at once poignant
  and unflinching, utterly contemporary and truly unforgettable.'
