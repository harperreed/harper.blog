description: "The first novel of a new space-opera sequence set in an all-new universe\
  \ by the Hugo Award-winning, New York Times-bestselling author of Redshirts and\
  \ Old Man's War.<br /><br />Our universe is ruled by physics and faster than light\
  \ travel is not possible -- until the discovery of The Flow, an extra-dimensional\
  \ field we can access at certain points in space-time that transport us to other\
  \ worlds, around other stars. <br /><br />Humanity flows away from Earth, into space,\
  \ and in time forgets our home world and creates a new empire, the Interdependency,\
  \ whose ethos requires that no one human outpost can survive without the others.\
  \ It\u2019s a hedge against interstellar war -- and a system of control for the\
  \ rulers of the empire.<br /><br />The Flow is eternal -- but it is not static.\
  \ Just as a river changes course, The Flow changes as well, cutting off worlds from\
  \ the rest of humanity. When it\u2019s discovered that The Flow is moving, possibly\
  \ cutting off all human worlds from faster than light travel forever, three individuals\
  \ -- a scientist, a starship captain and the Empress of the Interdependency -- are\
  \ in a race against time to discover what, if anything, can be salvaged from an\
  \ interstellar empire on the brink of collapse."
