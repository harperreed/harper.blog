description: "The computer revolution brought with it new methods of getting work\
  \ done\u2014just look at today's news for reports of hard-driven, highly-motivated\
  \ young software and online commerce developers who sacrifice evenings and weekends\
  \ to meet impossible deadlines. Tracy Kidder got a preview of this world in the\
  \ late 1970s when he observed the engineers of Data General design and build a new\
  \ 32-bit minicomputer in just one year. His thoughtful, prescient book, <i>The Soul\
  \ of a New Machine</i>, tells stories of 35-year-old \"veteran\" engineers hiring\
  \ recent college graduates and encouraging them to work harder and faster on complex\
  \ and difficult projects, exploiting the youngsters' ignorance of normal scheduling\
  \ processes while engendering a new kind of work ethic.<br /><br />These days, we\
  \ are used to the \"total commitment\" philosophy of managing technical creation,\
  \ but Kidder was surprised and even a little alarmed at the obsessions and compulsions\
  \ he found. From in-house political struggles to workers being permitted to tease\
  \ management to marathon 24-hour work sessions, <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i>\
  \ explores concepts that already seem familiar, even old-hat, less than 20 years\
  \ later. Kidder plainly admires his subjects; while he admits to hopeless confusion\
  \ about their work, he finds their dedication heroic. The reader wonders, though,\
  \ what will become of it all, now and in the future. <i>\u2014Rob Lightner</i>"
