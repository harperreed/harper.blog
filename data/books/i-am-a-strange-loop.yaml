description: "Can thought arise out of matter? Can self, soul, consciousness, \u201C\
  I\u201D arise out of mere matter? If it cannot, then how can you or I be here?<i>I\
  \ Am a Strange Loop</i> argues that the key to understanding selves and consciousness\
  \ is the \u201Cstrange loop\u201D\u2014a special kind of abstract feedback loop\
  \ inhabiting our brains. The most central and complex symbol in your brain is the\
  \ one called \u201CI.\u201D The \u201CI\u201D is the nexus in our brain, one of\
  \ many symbols seeming to have free will and to have gained the paradoxical ability\
  \ to push particles around, rather than the reverse.<br /><br />How can a mysterious\
  \ abstraction be real\u2014or is our \u201CI\u201D merely a convenient fiction?\
  \ Does an \u201CI\u201D exert genuine power over the particles in our brain, or\
  \ is it helplessly pushed around by the laws of physics?<br /><br />These are the\
  \ mysteries tackled in <i>I Am a Strange Loop</i>, Douglas Hofstadter\u2019s first\
  \ book-length journey into philosophy since <i>G\xF6del, Escher, Bach</i>. Compulsively\
  \ readable and endlessly thought-provoking, this is a moving and profound inquiry\
  \ into the nature of mind."
