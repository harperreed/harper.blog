description: "<b>SPECIAL 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION \u2014THE MOST IMPORTANT AND INFLUENTIAL\
  \ SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL OF THE PAST TWO DECADES<br /></b><br />Twenty years ago,\
  \ it was as if someone turned on a light. The future blazed into existence with\
  \ each deliberate word that William Gibson laid down. The winner of Hugo, Nebula,\
  \ and Philip K. Dick Awards, <i>Neuromancer</i> didn't just explode onto the science\
  \ fiction scene\u2014it permeated into the collective consciousness, culture, science,\
  \ and technology.<br /><br />Today, there is only one science fiction masterpiece\
  \ to thank for the term \"cyberpunk,\" for easing the way into the information age\
  \ and Internet society. <i>Neuromancer</i>'s virtual reality has become real. And\
  \ yet, William Gibson's gritty, sophisticated vision still manages to inspire the\
  \ minds that lead mankind ever further into the future."
