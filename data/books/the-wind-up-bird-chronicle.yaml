description: 'Japan''s most highly regarded novelist now vaults into the first ranks
  of international fiction writers with this heroically imaginative novel, which is
  at once a detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation
  of the buried secrets of World War II.<br /><br />In a Tokyo suburb a young man
  named Toru Okada searches for his wife''s missing cat. Soon he finds himself looking
  for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo.
  As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists:
  a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid
  sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed
  by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan''s forgotten campaign in Manchuria.<br
  /><br />Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, <i>The Wind-Up Bird
  Chronicle</i> is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and
  Pynchon.<br /><br />Three books in one volume: The Thieving Magpie, Bird as Prophet,
  The Birdcatcher. This translation by Jay Rubin is in collaboration with the author.'
