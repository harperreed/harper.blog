description: <em>The Woman in the Dunes</em>, by celebrated writer and thinker Kobo
  Abe, combines the essence of myth, suspense and the existential novel.<br /><br
  />After missing the last bus home following a day trip to the seashore, an amateur
  entomologist is offered lodging for the night at the bottom of a vast sand pit.
  But when he attempts to leave the next morning, he quickly discovers that the locals
  have other plans. Held captive with seemingly no chance of escape, he is tasked
  with shoveling back the ever-advancing sand dunes that threaten to destroy the village.
  His only companion is an odd young woman, and together their fates become intertwined
  as they work side by side through this Sisyphean of tasks.
