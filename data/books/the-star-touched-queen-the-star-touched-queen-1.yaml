description: "<i>Fate and fortune. Power and passion. What does it take to be the\
  \ queen of a kingdom when you\u2019re only seventeen?</i><br /><br />Maya is cursed.\
  \ With a horoscope that promises a marriage of death and destruction, she has earned\
  \ only the scorn and fear of her father\u2019s kingdom. Content to follow more scholarly\
  \ pursuits, her whole world is torn apart when her father, the Raja, arranges a\
  \ wedding of political convenience to quell outside rebellions. Soon Maya becomes\
  \ the queen of Akaran and wife of Amar. Neither roles are what she expected: As\
  \ Akaran\u2019s queen, she finds her voice and power. As Amar\u2019s wife, she finds\
  \ something else entirely: Compassion. Protection. Desire\u2026<br /><br />But Akaran\
  \ has its own secrets\u2014thousands of locked doors, gardens of glass, and a tree\
  \ that bears memories instead of fruit. Soon, Maya suspects her life is in danger.\
  \ Yet who, besides her husband, can she trust? With the fate of the human and Otherworldly\
  \ realms hanging in the balance, Maya must unravel an ancient mystery that spans\
  \ reincarnated lives to save those she loves the most\u2026including herself."
