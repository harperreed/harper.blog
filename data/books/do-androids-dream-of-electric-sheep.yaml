description: It was January 2021, and Rick Deckard had a license to kill.<br />Somewhere
  among the hordes of humans out there, lurked several rogue androids. Deckard's assignment--find
  them and then..."retire" them. Trouble was, the androids all looked exactly like
  humans, and they didn't want to be found!

      description: "\n\n    <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> takes place\
        \ in 1992 (2021 in later editions), years after the radioactive fallout of\
        \ World War Terminus destroyed most of Earth. The U.N. encourages emigration\
        \ to off-world colonies, in hope of preserving the human race from the terminal\
        \ effects of the fallout. One emigration incentive is giving each emigrant\
        \ an \"andy\" \u2014 a servant android.\r\n    \r\n    Three novels intended\
        \ to serve as sequels to both the novel <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>\
        \ and the movie of <i>Blade Runner</i> have been published: <i>Blade Runner\
        \ 2: The Edge of Human</i> (1995), <i>Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night</i>\
        \ (1996), <i>Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon</i> (2000). \r\n    \r\n    The\
        \ official and authorized novels were written by Philip K. Dick's friend,\
        \ K.W. Jeter. They continue the story of Rick Deckard and attempt to resolve\
        \ many of the differences between the novel and the film but <b>none</b> of\
        \ the books is a novelization of the movie. The book <i>Blade Runner</i> is\
        \ identical to <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> with or without\
        \ added movie photos etc.\n\n"
