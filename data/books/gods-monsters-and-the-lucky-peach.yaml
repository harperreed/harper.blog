description: Discover a shifting history of adventure as humanity clashes over whether
  to repair their ruined planet or luxuriate in a less tainted past.<br /><br />In
  2267, Earth has just begun to recover from worldwide ecological disasters. Minh
  is part of the generation that first moved back up to the surface of the Earth from
  the underground hells, to reclaim humanity's ancestral habitat. She's spent her
  entire life restoring river ecosystems, but lately the kind of long-term restoration
  projects Minh works on have been stalled due to the invention of time travel. When
  she gets the opportunity take a team to 2000 BC to survey the Tigris and Euphrates
  rivers, she jumps at the chance to uncover the secrets of the shadowy think tank
  that controls time travel technology.
