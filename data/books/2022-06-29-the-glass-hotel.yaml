description: '<b>From the award-winning author of <i>Station Eleven,</i> a captivating
  novel of money, beauty, white-collar crime, ghosts, and moral compromise in which
  a woman disappears from a container ship off the coast of Mauritania and a massive
  Ponzi scheme implodes in New York, dragging countless fortunes with it.</b><br /><br
  />Vincent is a bartender at the Hotel Caiette, a five-star glass and cedar palace
  on an island in British Columbia. Jonathan Alkaitis works in finance and owns the
  hotel. When he passes Vincent his card with a tip, it''s the beginning of their
  life together. That same day, Vincent''s half-brother, Paul, scrawls a note on the
  windowed wall of the hotel: "Why don''t you swallow broken glass." Leon Prevant,
  a shipping executive for a company called Neptune Logistics, sees the note from
  the hotel bar and is shaken to his core. Thirteen years later Vincent mysteriously
  disappears from the deck of the Neptune Cumberland. Weaving together the lives of
  these characters, <i>The Glass Hotel </i>moves between the ship, the skyscrapers
  of Manhattan, and the wilderness of northern Vancouver Island, painting a breathtaking
  picture of greed and guilt, fantasy and delusion, art and the ghosts of our pasts.'
