description: "When unforeseen circumstances during an innovative\u2014and unsanctioned\u2014\
  commercial asteroid-mining mission leave two crew members stranded, those who make\
  \ it back must engineer a rescue, all while navigating a shifting web of global\
  \ political alliances and renewed Cold War tensions. With Earth governments consumed\
  \ by the ravages of climate change and unable to take the risks necessary to make\
  \ rapid progress in space, the crew must build their own nextgen spacecraft capable\
  \ of mounting a rescue in time for the asteroid's next swing by Earth.<br /> <br\
  \ />In the process they'll need to establish the first spin-gravity station in deep\
  \ space, the first orbiting solar power satellite and refinery, and historic infrastructure\
  \ on the moon's surface\u2014all of which could alleviate a deepening ecological,\
  \ political, and economic crisis back on Earth, and prove that space-based industry\
  \ is not only profitable, but possibly humanity's best hope for a livable, peaceful\
  \ future."
