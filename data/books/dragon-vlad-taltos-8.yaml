description: '<b>In which Vlad Taltos finds himself, much to his surprise, at the
  fateful Battle of Baritt''s Tomb</b><br /><br />Marching through mud just isn''t
  as much fun as they say.<br /><br />After years of surviving in Adrilankha by practicing
  the trade he knows best--killing people for a living--suddenly Vlad Taltos finds
  himself in the last place any self-respecting assassin wants to be: the army. Worse,
  he''s right in the middle of a apocalyptic battle between two sorcerous armies,
  and everyone expects him to play a role they won''t explain. All Vlad''s got between
  him and the worst kind of death is his wits. Oh, and a smart-mouthed winged lizard...<br
  /><br /><i>Dragon</i> is Steven Brust at his best--a swashbuckling fantasy adventure.'

        \ world.</a>\r\n    \r\n    Of the ordering, the author notes:<blockquote>One\
        \ of the questions I'm most often asked is: \"In what order would you recommend\
        \ reading these books?\" Unfortunately, I'm just exactly the wrong guy to\
        \ ask. I made every effort to write them so that they could be read in any\
        \ order. I am aware that, in some measure at least, I have failed (I certainly\
        \ wouldn't recommend starting with <i>Teckla</i>, for example), but the fact\
        \ that I was trying makes me incapable of giving an answer.\r\n    \r\n  \
        \  Many people whose opinion I respect believe publication order is best .\
        \ . . The choice, I daresay, is yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy them.\r\
        \n    \r\n    --Steven Brust, 1999, in the notes for <i>The Book of Jhereg</i></blockquote>The\
        \ books are numbered in publication order;  here is a rough guide to chronological\
        \ order:\r\n    \r\n        Taltos (1988)\r\n        Dragon (1998)\r\n   \
