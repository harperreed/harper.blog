description: Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, masquerading as
  an ordinary schoolteacher in a quiet small town, comes home to find that her husband
  has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Mighty Sanze, the
  empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years,
  collapses as its greatest city is destroyed by a madman's vengeance. And worst of
  all, across the heartland of the world's sole continent, a great red rift has been
  torn which spews ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries. But this
  is the Stillness, a land long familiar with struggle, and where orogenes -- those
  who wield the power of the earth as a weapon -- are feared far more than the long
  cold night. Essun has remembered herself, and she will have her daughter back. She
  does not care if the world falls apart around her. Essun will break it herself,
  if she must, to save her daughter.
