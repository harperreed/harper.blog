description: '<i>Alternate Cover Edition can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22062498-a-fire-upon-the-deep"
  rel="nofollow">here</a>. </i><br /><br /><i>A Fire upon the Deep</i> is the big,
  breakout book that fulfills the promise of Vinge''s career to date: a gripping tale
  of galactic war told on a cosmic scale.<br /><br />Thousands of years hence, many
  races inhabit a universe where a mind''s potential is determined by its location
  in space, from superintelligent entities in the Transcend, to the limited minds
  of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures and technology can function.
  Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these "regions of thought,"
  but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon,
  they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and
  enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.<br /><br />Fleeing the threat,
  a family of scientists, including two children, are taken captive by the Tines,
  an alien race with a harsh medieval culture, and used as pawns in a ruthless power
  struggle. A rescue mission, not entirely composed of humans, must rescue the children-and
  a secret that may save the rest of interstellar civilization.'

      description: "\n\n    Thousands of years from now, a mind's potential is determined\
        \ by its location in space\u2014from superintelligent entities in the Transcend,\
        \ to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures\
        \ and technology can function. Nobody knows what strange force partitioned\
        \ space into these \"regions of thought,\" but when the warring Straumli realm\
        \ use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash\
        \ an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural\
        \ and artificial intelligence.\r\n    \r\n    Vernor Vinge first used the\
        \ concepts of <i>\"Zones of Thought\"</i> in a 1988 novella, <i>\"The Blabber\"\
        </i>, which occurs after Fire. Vinge's novel, <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>,\
        \ is a prequel to <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> set 20,000 years earlier and\
        \ featuring Pham Nuwen. Vinge's <i>Children of the Sky</i> is \"a near-term\
        \ sequel to A Fire Upon the Deep\", set ten years later.\r\n    \r\n    Vinge's\
        \ former wife, Joan D. Vinge, has also written stories in the Zones of Thought\
        \ universe, based on his notes. These include <i>\"The Outcasts of Heaven\
        \ Belt\"</i> and <i>\"Legacy\"</i>.\r\n    \r\n    Vernor Vinge won a Hugo\
        \ Award for <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i>. He also won a Hugo, a John W. Campbell\
        \ and a Prometheus Award for <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>.\r\n    \r\n   \
        \ \r\n    Publication order is as follows:\r\n    \r\n    A Fire Upon the\
        \ Deep\r\n    A Deepness in the Sky\r\n    The Children of the Sky\r\n   \
        \ \r\n    \r\n    Chronological order is:\r\n    \r\n    A Deepness in the\
        \ Sky\r\n    A Fire Upon the Deep\r\n    The Children of the Sky\r\n    \r\
        \n    Some say \"The first book can be read as a stand-alone. Book 3 is the\
        \ continuation of book 1, and has less of the space opera element. Book 2\
        \ can be skipped from the story, or can be read as it's own book. In the timeline\
        \ it is a prequel but it is loosely related to book 1.\"\n\n"
