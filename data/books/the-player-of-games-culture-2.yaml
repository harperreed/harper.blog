description: The Culture - a human/machine symbiotic society - has thrown up many
  great Game Players, and one of the greatest is Gurgeh. Jernau Morat Gurgeh. The
  Player of Games. Master of every board, computer and strategy. Bored with success,
  Gurgeh travels to the Empire of Azad, cruel and incredibly wealthy, to try their
  fabulous game...a game so complex, so like life itself, that the winner becomes
  emperor. Mocked, blackmailed, almost murdered, Gurgeh accepts the game, and with
  it the challenge of his life - and very possibly his death.<br /><br />Praise for
  Iain M. Banks:<br /><br />"Poetic, humorous, baffling, terrifying, sexy -- the books
  of Iain M. Banks are all these things and more" -- <em>NME</em><br /><br />"An exquisitely
  riotous tour de force of the imagination which writes its own rules simply for the
  pleasure of breaking them." -- <em>Time Out</em>
