description: "By June 1993, when Washington, D.C.'s Fugazi released their third full-length\
  \ album <i>In on the Kill Taker</i>, the quartet was reaching a thunderous peak\
  \ in popularity and influence. With two EPs (combined into the classic CD <i>13\
  \ songs</i>) and two albums (1990's genre-defining <i>Repeater</i> and 1991's impressionistic\
  \ follow-up <i>Steady Diet of Nothing</i>) inside of five years, Fugazi was on creative\
  \ roll, astounding increasingly large audiences as they toured, blasting fist-pumping\
  \ anthems and jammy noise-workouts that roared into every open underground heart.\
  \ When the album debuted on the now-SoundScan-driven charts, Fugazi had never been\
  \ more in the public eye.<br /><br />Few knew how difficult it had been to make\
  \ this popular breakthrough. Disappointed with the sound of the self-produced <i>Steady\
  \ Diet</i>, the band recorded with legendary engineer Steve Albini, only to scrap\
  \ the sessions and record at home in D.C. with Ted Niceley, their brilliant, under-known\
  \ producer. Inadvertently, Fugazi chose an unsure moment to make <i>In on the Kill\
  \ Taker</i>: as Nirvana and Sonic Youth were yanking the American rock underground\
  \ into the media glare, and \u201Cbreaking\u201D punk in every possible meaning\
  \ of the word. Despite all of this, <i>Kill Taker</i> became an alt-rock classic\
  \ in spite of itself, even as its defiant, muscular sound stood in stark contrast\
  \ to everything represented by the mainstreaming of a culture and worldview they\
  \ held dear.<br /><br />This book features new interviews with all four members\
  \ of Fugazi and members of their creative community."
