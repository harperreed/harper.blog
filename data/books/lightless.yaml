description: "Serving aboard the <i>Ananke,</i> an experimental military spacecraft\
  \ launched by the ruthless organization that rules Earth and its solar system, computer\
  \ scientist Althea has established an intense emotional bond\u2014not with any of\
  \ her crewmates, but with the ship\u2019s electronic systems, which speak more deeply\
  \ to her analytical mind than human feelings do. But when a pair of fugitive terrorists\
  \ gain access to the <i>Ananke,</i> Althea must draw upon her heart and soul for\
  \ the strength to defend her beloved ship.<br /> \_<br /> While one of the saboteurs\
  \ remains at large somewhere on board, his captured partner\u2014the enigmatic Ivan\u2014\
  may prove to be more dangerous. The perversely fascinating criminal whose silver\
  \ tongue is his most effective weapon has long evaded the authorities\u2019 most\
  \ relentless surveillance\u2014and kept the truth about his methods and motives\
  \ well hidden.<br /> \_<br /> As the ship\u2019s systems begin to malfunction and\
  \ the claustrophobic atmosphere is increasingly poisoned by distrust and suspicion,\
  \ it falls to Althea to penetrate the prisoner\u2019s layers of intrigue and deception\
  \ before all is lost. But when the true nature of Ivan\u2019s mission is exposed,\
  \ it will change Althea forever\u2014if it doesn\u2019t kill her first.<br />"
