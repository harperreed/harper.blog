description: "While dreaming of an easier way to order pizza, Mike Evans founded the\
  \ online food delivery site, Grubhub , in his basement and grew it into the multi-billion-dollar\
  \ colossus that is now a household name. But it wasn't as easy as searching, clicking,\
  \ and checking out. Mike's meteoric rise to the top of the booming tech and business\
  \ world demanded a decade of 80 hour work weeks, endless financing rounds, cliffhanger\
  \ acquisitions, the near collapse of his collaterally-damaged marriage, a brutally\
  \ difficult merger, and a pair of tumultuous I quit/unquit moments, all to steer\
  \ the company to its successful IPO. And then, at the height of his success, he\
  \ scrapped it all\u2014leaving Grubhub behind and finding a new path as an entrepreneur,\
  \ literally, on a solo bike ride across America.<br /> \_<br /> HANGRY is the unveiled\
  \ and unfiltered rags-to-riches story of how Grubhub came to exemplify the promise\
  \ of tech and the gig worker economy, and how it failed to live up to its impressive\
  \ potential,\_even as it threatened Evans's sanity and marriage. \u201CI\u2019d\
  \ created Frankenstein,\u201D Evans writes."
