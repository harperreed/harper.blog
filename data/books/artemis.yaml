description: "Jazz Bashara is a criminal.<br /><br />Well, sort of. Life on Artemis,\
  \ the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or\
  \ an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband\
  \ barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter\
  \ barely covers the rent.<br /><br />Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance\
  \ to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling\
  \ off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's\
  \ stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself\u2014and that now,\
  \ her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first."
