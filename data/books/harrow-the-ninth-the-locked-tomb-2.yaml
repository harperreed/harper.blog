description: "She answered the Emperor's call.<br /><br />She arrived with her arts,\
  \ her wits, and her only friend.<br /><br />In victory, her world has turned to\
  \ ash.<br /><br />After rocking the cosmos with her deathly debut, Tamsyn Muir continues\
  \ the story of the penumbral Ninth House in <i>Harrow the Ninth</i>, a mind-twisting\
  \ puzzle box of mystery, murder, magic, and mayhem. Nothing is as it seems in the\
  \ halls of the Emperor, and the fate of the galaxy rests on one woman's shoulders.<br\
  \ /><br />Harrowhark Nonagesimus, last necromancer of the Ninth House, has been\
  \ drafted by her Emperor to fight an unwinnable war. Side-by-side with a detested\
  \ rival, Harrow must perfect her skills and become an angel of undeath \u2014 but\
  \ her health is failing, her sword makes her nauseous, and even her mind is threatening\
  \ to betray her. <br /><br />Sealed in the gothic gloom of the Emperor's Mithraeum\
  \ with three unfriendly teachers, hunted by the mad ghost of a murdered planet,\
  \ Harrow must confront two unwelcome questions: is somebody trying to kill her?\
  \ And if they succeeded, would the universe be better off?"
