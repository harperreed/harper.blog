description: "<strong>Return to the sprawling, Hugo Award-winning universe of the\
  \ Galactic Commons to explore another corner of the cosmos\u2014one often mentioned,\
  \ but not yet explored\u2014in this absorbing entry in the Wayfarers series, which\
  \ blends heart-warming characters and imaginative adventure.</strong><p>With no\
  \ water, no air, and no native life, the planet Gora is unremarkable. The only thing\
  \ it has going for it is a chance proximity to more popular worlds, making it a\
  \ decent stopover for ships traveling between the wormholes that keep the Galactic\
  \ Commons connected. If deep space is a highway, Gora is just your average truck\
  \ stop.</p><p>At the Five-Hop One-Stop, long-haul spacers can stretch their legs\
  \ (if they have legs, that is), and get fuel, transit permits, and assorted supplies.\
  \ The Five-Hop is run by an enterprising alien and her sometimes helpful child,\
  \ who work hard to provide a little piece of home to everyone passing through.</p><p>When\
  \ a freak technological failure halts all traffic to and from Gora, three strangers\u2014\
  all different species with different aims\u2014are thrown together at the Five-Hop.\
  \ Grounded, with nothing to do but wait, the trio\u2014an exiled artist with an\
  \ appointment to keep, a cargo runner at a personal crossroads, and a mysterious\
  \ individual doing her best to help those on the fringes\u2014are compelled to confront\
  \ where they\u2019ve been, where they might go, and what they are, or could be,\
  \ to each other.</p>"
