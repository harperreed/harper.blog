description: <b>'On the morning of April 16, Dr Rieux emerged from his consulting-room
  and came across a dead rat in the middle of the landing.'</b><br /><br />It starts
  with the rats. Vomiting blood, they die in their hundreds, then in their thousands.
  When the rats are all gone, the citizens begin to fall sick. Like the rats, they
  too die in ever greater numbers.<br /><br />The authorities quarantine the town.
  Cut off, the terrified townspeople must face this horror alone. Some resign themselves
  to death or the whims of fate. Others seek someone to blame, or dream of revenge.
  One is determined to escape.<br /><br />But a few, like stoic Dr Rieux, stand together
  to fight the terror. A monstrous evil has entered their lives but they will never
  surrender.<br /><br />They will resist the plague.<br /><br />'A matchless fable
  of fear, courage and cowardice' <i>Independent</i>
