description: 'The men on board HMS <i>Terror</i> have every expectation of triumph.
  As part of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, the first steam-powered vessels ever to
  search for the legendary Northwest Passage, they are as scientifically supported
  an enterprise as has ever set forth. As they enter a second summer in the Arctic
  Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching
  ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive
  with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip
  of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something
  out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous
  terror constantly clawing to get in.<br /><br />When the expedition''s leader, Sir
  John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and
  leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the
  ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to
  survival, or the harbinger of their deaths. But as another winter approaches, as
  scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them
  southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape.'
