description: Her city is under siege.<br /><br />The zombies are coming back.<br /><br
  />And all Nona wants is a birthday party.<br /><br />In many ways, Nona is like
  other people. She lives with her family, has a job at her local school, and loves
  walks on the beach and meeting new dogs. But Nona's not like other people. Six months
  ago she woke up in a stranger's body, and she's afraid she might have to give it
  back.<br /><br />The whole city is falling to pieces. A monstrous blue sphere hangs
  on the horizon, ready to tear the planet apart. Blood of Eden forces have surrounded
  the last Cohort facility and wait for the Emperor Undying to come calling. Their
  leaders want Nona to be the weapon that will save them from the Nine Houses. Nona
  would prefer to live an ordinary life with the people she loves, with Pyrrha and
  Camilla and Palamedes, but she also knows that nothing lasts forever.<br /><br />And
  each night, Nona dreams of a woman with a skull-painted face...
