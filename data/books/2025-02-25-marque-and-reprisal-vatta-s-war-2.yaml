description: "Kylara Vatta, risk-taking, rule-breaking, can-do heroine of <i>Trading\
  \ in Danger,</i> is back in business\u2013the kind that\u2019s anything but usual\u2013\
  in the new military science fiction adventure by ace action storyteller Elizabeth\
  \ Moon.<br /><br />The exciting military career she hoped for never got off the\
  \ ground\u2013but Ky Vatta ended up seeing plenty of combat when she took the helm\
  \ of one of the commercial transport vessels in her family\u2019s fleet . . . and\
  \ steered it into a full-blown war. Now the lessons she learned in that trial by\
  \ fire are about to pay off: because this time, the war has come to her. To be exact,\
  \ someone unknown has launched a full-throttle offensive against Vatta Transport\
  \ Ltd., Ky\u2019s father\u2019s interstellar shipping empire. In short order, most\
  \ of Ky\u2019s family is killed, and subsequent attacks sever vital lines of communication,\
  \ leaving Ky fighting, in every sense, to survive.<br /><br />Determined to identify\
  \ the ruthless mystery enemy and avenge her family\u2019s name, Ky needs not only\
  \ firepower but information. And she gets both in spades\u2013from the band of stranded\
  \ mercenaries she hooks up with, from her black-sheep cousin, Stella, who\u2019\
  s been leading a secret life, and from Stella\u2019s roguish ex-lover, Rafe. Together\
  \ they struggle to penetrate the tangled web of political intrigue that\u2019s wreaking\
  \ havoc within InterStellar Communications, whose effective operation their own\
  \ livelihoods\u2013and perhaps lives\u2013depend on.<br /><br />But the infighting\
  \ proves to be infectious, and it isn\u2019t long before Ky\u2019s hired military\
  \ muscle are turning their suspicions on the enigmatic Rafe, whose wealth of knowledge\
  \ about ISC\u2019s clashing factions and startling new technologies has begun to\
  \ make him smell like a rat . . . or a mole. With swift, violent destruction a very\
  \ real possibility, the last thing Ky needs is a crew divided against itself\u2013\
  and she\u2019s prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that Vatta\
  \ stays in business, as well as in one piece.<br /><br />What she\u2019s not prepared\
  \ for is the shocking truth behind the terror\u2013 and a confrontation with murderous\
  \ treachery from a source as unexpected as it is unrelenting.<br /><br /><br /><i>From\
