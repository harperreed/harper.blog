description: '2lst century Tokyo, after the millennial quake. Neon rain. Light everywhere
  blowing under any door you might try to close. Where the New Buildings, the largest
  in the world, erect themselves unaided, their slow rippling movements like the contractions
  of a sea-creature.Colin Laney is here looking for work. He is not, he is careful
  to point out, a voyeur. He is an intuitive fisher of patterns of information, the
  "signature" a particular individual creates simply by going about the business of
  living. But Laney knows how to sift for the interesting (read: dangerous) bits.
  Which makes him very useful--to certain people.Chia McKenzie is here on a rescue
  mission. She''s fourteen. Her idol is the singer Rez, of the band Lo/Rez. When the
  Seattle chapter of the Lo/Rez fan club decided that he might be in trouble, in Tokyo,
  they sent Chia to check it out.Rei Toei is the beautiful, entirely virtual media
  star adored by all Japan. The<i> idoru</i>. And Rez has declared that he will marry
  her. This is the rumor that brought Chia to Tokyo. But the things that bother Rez
  are not the things that bother most people. Is something different here, in the
  very nature of reality? Or is it that something violently New is about to happen?
  It''s possible the<i> idoru</i> is as real as she wants or needs to be--or as real
  as Rez desires. When Colin Laney looks into her dark eyes, trying hard to think
  of her as no more than a hologram, he sees things he''s never seen before. He sees
  how she might break a man''s heart.And, whatever else may be true, the <i>idoru
  </i>and the powerful interests surrounding her are enough to put all their lives
  in danger.'
