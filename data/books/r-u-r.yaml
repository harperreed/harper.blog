description: "<b>A visionary work of science fiction that introduced the word \"robot\"\
  </b><br /><br />Written in 1920, premiered in Prague in 1921, and first performed\
  \ in New York in 1922\u2014garnered worldwide acclaim for its author and popularized\
  \ the word robot. Mass-produced as efficient laborers to serve man, Capek\u2019\
  s Robots are an android product\u2014they remember everything but think of nothing\
  \ new. But the Utopian life they provide ultimately lacks meaning, and the humans\
  \ they serve stop reproducing. When the Robots revolt, killing all but one of their\
  \ masters, they must strain to learn the secret of self-duplication. It is not until\
  \ two Robots fall in love and are christened \u201CAdam\u201D and \u201CEve\u201D\
  \ by the last surviving human that Nature emerges triumphant.<br /><br />For more\
  \ than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature\
  \ in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents\
  \ a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and\
