description: <b>Inheriting your uncle's supervillain business is more complicated
  than you might think. Particularly when you discover who's running the place.</b><br
  /><br />Charlie's life is going nowhere fast. A divorced substitute teacher living
  with his cat in a house his siblings want to sell, all he wants is to open a pub
  downtown, if only the bank will approve his loan.<br /><br />Then his long-lost
  uncle Jake dies and leaves his supervillain business (complete with island volcano
  lair) to Charlie. <br /><br />But becoming a supervillain isn't all giant laser
  death rays and lava pits. Jake had enemies, and now they're coming after Charlie.
  His uncle might have been a stand-up, old-fashioned kind of villain, but these are
  the real rich, soulless predators backed by multinational corporations and venture
  capital. <br /><br />It's up to Charlie to win the war his uncle started against
  a league of supervillains. But with unionized dolphins, hyper-intelligent talking
  spy cats, and a terrifying henchperson at his side, going bad is starting to look
  pretty good.<br /><br />In a dog-eat-dog world...be a cat.<br /><br />At the Publisher's
  request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM)
  applied.
