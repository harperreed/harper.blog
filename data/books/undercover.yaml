description: "When a stranger comes to town, secrets are sure to come out. New York\
  \ Times bestselling author Tamsyn Muir spins a twisty\u2014and twisted\u2014short\
  \ story of revenge and survival.<br /><br />A fresh-faced newcomer arrives in an\
  \ isolated, gang-run town and soon finds herself taking a job nobody else wants:\
  \ bodyguard to a ghoul. Not just your average mindless, half-rotted shuffler, though.\
  \ Lucille is a dancer who can still put on her own lipstick and whose shows are\
  \ half burlesque, half gladiator match. But the stranger is no stranger to this\
  \ particular ghoul. Both women are undercover in their own way. And both have something\
  \ to lose if their connection comes to light."
