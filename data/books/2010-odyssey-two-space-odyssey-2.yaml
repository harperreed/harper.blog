description: 'When <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> first shocked, amazed, and delighted
  millions in the late 1960s, the novel was quickly recognized as a classic. Since
  then, its fame has grown steadily among the multitudes who have read the novel or
  seen the film based on it. Yet, along with almost universal acclaim, a host of questions
  has grown more insistent through the years:<br /><br />Who or what transformed Dave
  Bowman into the Star-Child? What purpose lay behind the transformation? What would
  become of the Star-Child?<br /><br />What alien purpose lay behind the monoliths
  on the Moon and out in space?<br /><br />What could drive HAL, a stable, intelligent
  computer, to kill the crew? Was HAL really insane? What happened to HAL and the
  spaceship Discovery after Dave Bowman disappeared?<br /><br />Would there be a sequel?<br
  /><br />Now all those questions and many more have been answered. In this stunning
  sequel to his international bestseller, Clarke has written what will truly be one
  of the great books of the ''80s. Cosmic in sweep, eloquent in its depiction of Man''s
  place in the Universe, and filled with the romance of space, this novel is a monumental
  achievement.'
