description: "<b>A work of history that explores the life of an unconventional woman\
  \ during the first half of the 19th century in Edo\u2014the city that would become\
  \ Tokyo\u2014and a portrait of a great city on the brink of a momentous encounter\
  \ with the West.</b><br /><br />The daughter of a Buddhist priest, Tsuneno was born\
  \ in a rural Japanese village and was expected to live a traditional life much like\
  \ her mother\u2019s. But after three divorces, she ran away to make a life for herself\
  \ in one of the largest cities in the world: Edo.<br /><br />In the book we experience\
  \ the drama and excitement of Edo just prior to the arrival of American Commodore\
  \ Perry\u2019s fleet, which transformed Japan. During this pivotal moment in Japanese\
  \ history, Tsuneno bounces from tenement to tenement, marries a masterless samurai,\
  \ and eventually enters the service of a famous city magistrate. Tsuneno\u2019s\
  \ life provides a window into 19th-century Japanese culture\u2014and a rare view\
  \ of an extraordinary woman who sacrificed her family and her reputation to make\
  \ a new life for herself, in defiance of social conventions."
