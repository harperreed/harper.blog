description: 'Zachary Quinto - best known for his role as the Nimoy-approved Spock
  in the recent Star Trek reboot and the menacing, power-stealing serial killer, Sylar,
  in Heroes - brings his well-earned sci-fi credentials and simmering intensity to
  this audio-exclusive novella from master storyteller John Scalzi.<br /><br />One
  day, not long from now, it becomes almost impossible to murder anyone - 999 times
  out of a thousand, anyone who is intentionally killed comes back. How? We don''t
  know. But it changes everything: war, crime, daily life.<br />Tony Valdez is a Dispatcher
  - a licensed, bonded professional whose job is to humanely dispatch those whose
  circumstances put them in death''s crosshairs, so they can have a second chance
  to avoid the reaper. But when a fellow Dispatcher and former friend is apparently
  kidnapped, Tony learns that there are some things that are worse than death and
  that some people are ready to do almost anything to avenge a supposed wrong.<br
  />It''s a race against time for Valdez to find his friend before it''s too late...before
  not even a Dispatcher can save him.'
