description: "An innovative new anthology exploring how science fiction can motivate\
  \ new approaches to economics.<br /><br />From the libertarian economics of Ayn\
  \ Rand to Aldous Huxley's consumerist dystopias, economics and science fiction have\
  \ often orbited each other. In Economic Science Fictions, editor William Davies\
  \ has deliberately merged the two worlds, asking how we might harness the power\
  \ of the utopian imagination to revitalize economic thinking.<br /><br />Rooted\
  \ in the sense that our current economic reality is no longer credible or viable,\
  \ this collection treats our economy as a series of fictions and science fiction\
  \ as a means of anticipating different economic futures. It asks how science fiction\
  \ can motivate new approaches to economics and provides surprising new syntheses,\
  \ merging social science with fiction, design with politics, scholarship with experimental\
  \ forms. With an opening chapter from Ha-Joon Chang as well as theory, short stories,\
  \ and reflections on design, this book from Goldsmiths Press challenges and changes\
  \ the notion that economics and science fiction are worlds apart. The result is\
  \ a wealth of fresh and unusual perspectives for anyone who believes the economy\
  \ is too important to be left solely to economists.<br /><br />Contributors AUDINT,\
  \ Khairani Barokka, Carina Brand, Ha-Joon Chang, Miriam Cherry, William Davies,\
  \ Mark Fisher, Dan Gavshon-Brady and James Pockson, Owen Hatherley, Laura Horn,\
  \ Tim Jackson, Mark Johnson, Bastien Kerspern, Nora O Murch\xFA, Tobias Revell et\
  \ al., Judy Thorne, Sherryl Vint, Joseph Walton, Brian Willems"
