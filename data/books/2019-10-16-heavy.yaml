description: "In this powerful and provocative memoir, genre-bending essayist and\
  \ novelist Kiese Laymon explores what the weight of a lifetime of secrets, lies,\
  \ and deception does to a black body, a black family, and a nation teetering on\
  \ the brink of moral collapse.<br />Kiese Laymon is a fearless writer. In his essays,\
  \ personal stories combine with piercing intellect to reflect both on the state\
  \ of American society and on his experiences with abuse, which conjure conflicted\
  \ feelings of shame, joy, confusion and humiliation. Laymon invites us to consider\
  \ the consequences of growing up in a nation wholly obsessed with progress yet wholly\
  \ disinterested in the messy work of reckoning with where we\u2019ve been.<br />\
  \ <br />In <i>Heavy</i>, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up\
  \ a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson,\
  \ Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension\
  \ from college, to his trek to New York as a young college professor, Laymon charts\
  \ his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex,\
  \ writing, and ultimately gambling. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and\
  \ his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, Laymon asks himself, his mother, his nation,\
  \ and us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually\
  \ know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of\
  \ actually becoming free.<br /> <br /> A personal narrative that illuminates national\
  \ failures, <i>Heavy </i>is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical\
  \ exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family that begins with\
  \ a confusing childhood\u2014and continues through twenty-five years of haunting\
  \ implosions and long reverberations."
