description: Told with P. D. James's trademark suspense, insightful characterization,
  and riveting storytelling, <i>The Children of Men</i> is a story of a world with
  no children and no future. The human race has become infertile, and the last generation
  to be born is now adult. Civilization itself is crumbling as suicide and despair
  become commonplace. Oxford historian Theodore Faron, apathetic toward a future without
  a future, spends most of his time reminiscing. Then he is approached by Julian,
  a bright, attractive woman who wants him to help get her an audience with his cousin,
  the powerful Warden of England. She and her band of unlikely revolutionaries may
  just awaken his desire to live . . . and they may also hold the key to survival
  for the human race.
