description: "<em>No, I didn\u2019t kill the dead human. If I had, I wouldn\u2019\
  t dump the body in the station mall.</em><br /><br />When Murderbot discovers a\
  \ dead body on Preservation Station, it knows it is going to have to assist station\
  \ security to determine who the body is (was), how they were killed (that should\
  \ be relatively straightforward, at least), and why (because apparently that matters\
  \ to a lot of people\u2014who knew?)<br /><br />Yes, the unthinkable is about to\
  \ happen: Murderbot must voluntarily speak to humans!<br /><br />Again!"
