description: "<b>The electrifying first appearance of Jo Nesb\xF8\u2019s detective,\
  \ Harry Hole.<br /></b>\_<br />Inspector Harry Hole of the Oslo Crime Squad is dispatched\
  \ to Sydney to observe a murder case.\_ Harry is free to offer assistance, but he\
  \ has firm instructions to stay out of trouble. The victim is a twenty-three year\
  \ old Norwegian woman who is a minor celebrity back home. Never one to sit on the\
  \ sidelines, Harry befriends one of the lead detectives, and one of the witnesses,\
  \ as he is drawn deeper into the case.\_ Together, they discover that this is only\
  \ the latest in a string of unsolved murders, and the pattern points toward a psychopath\
  \ working his way across the country. As they circle closer and closer to the killer,\
  \ Harry begins to fear that no one is safe, least of all those investigating the\
  \ case.<br /><br /><br /><b>BONUS MATERIAL:</b>\_This ebook edition includes an\
  \ excerpt from Jo\_Nesb\xF8's\_<i>Police</i>."
