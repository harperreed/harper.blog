description: After years of struggle, the Foundation lay in ruins--destroyed by the
  mutant mind power of the Mule. But it was rumored that there was a Second Foundation
  hidden somewhere at the end of the Galaxy, established to preserve the knowledge
  of mankind through the long centuries of barbarism. The Mule had failed to find
  it the first time--but now he was certain he knew where it lay.<br /><br />The fate
  of the Foundation rests on young Arkady Darell, only fourteen years old and burdened
  with a terrible secret. As its scientists girded for a final showdown with the Mule,
  the survivors of the First Foundation began their desperate search. They too wanted
  the Second Foundation destroyed... before it destroyed them.
