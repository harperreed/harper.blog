description: "On a cold spring night in 1952, a huge meteorite fell to earth and obliterated\
  \ much of the east coast of the United States, including Washington D.C. The ensuing\
  \ climate cataclysm will soon render the earth inhospitable for humanity, as the\
  \ last such meteorite did for the dinosaurs. This looming threat calls for a radically\
  \ accelerated effort to colonize space, and requires a much larger share of humanity\
  \ to take part in the process.<br /><br />Elma York\u2019s experience as a WASP\
  \ pilot and mathematician earns her a place in the International Aerospace Coalition\u2019\
  s attempts to put man on the moon, as a calculator. But with so many skilled and\
  \ experienced women pilots and scientists involved with the program, it doesn\u2019\
  t take long before Elma begins to wonder why they can\u2019t go into space, too.<br\
  \ /><br />Elma\u2019s drive to become the first Lady Astronaut is so strong that\
  \ even the most dearly held conventions of society may not stand a chance against\
  \ her."
