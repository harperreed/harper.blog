description: "<b>\n  <b>A surreal, devastating story of a homeless ghost who haunts\
  \ one of Tokyo's busiest train stations.</b>\n</b><br /><br />Kazu is dead. Born\
  \ in Fukushima in 1933, the same year as the Japanese Emperor, his life is tied\
  \ by a series of coincidences to the Imperial family and has been shaped at every\
  \ turn by modern Japanese history. But his life story is also marked by bad luck,\
  \ and now, in death, he is unable to rest, doomed to haunt the park near Ueno Station\
  \ in Tokyo. <br /><br />Kazu's life in the city began and ended in that park; he\
  \ arrived there to work as a laborer in the preparations for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics\
  \ and ended his days living in the vast homeless village in the park, traumatized\
  \ by the destruction of the 2011 tsunami and shattered by the announcement of the\
  \ 2020 Olympics.<br /><br />Through Kazu's eyes, we see daily life in Tokyo buzz\
  \ around him and learn the intimate details of his personal story, how loss and\
  \ society's inequalities and constrictions spiraled towards this ghostly fate, with\
  \ moments of beauty and grace just out of reach. A powerful masterwork from one\
  \ of Japan's most brilliant outsider writers, <i>Tokyo Ueno Station</i> is a book\
  \ for our times and a look into a marginalized existence in a shiny global megapolis."
