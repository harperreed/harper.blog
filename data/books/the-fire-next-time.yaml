description: "<b>A national bestseller when it first appeared in 1963,\_<i>The Fire\
  \ Next Time</i>\_galvanized the nation, gave passionate voice to the emerging civil\
  \ rights movement\u2014and still lights the way to understanding race in America\
  \ today.\_\_</b><br /><br />\"Basically the finest essay I\u2019ve ever read.\_\
  . . . Baldwin refused to hold anyone\u2019s hand. He was both direct and beautiful\
  \ all at once. He did not seem to write to convince you. He wrote beyond you.\u201D\
  \ \u2014Ta-Nehisi Coates<br /><b>\_</b><br />At once a powerful evocation of James\
  \ Baldwin's early life in Harlem and a disturbing examination of the consequences\
  \ of racial injustice, the book is an intensely personal and provocative document\
  \ from the iconic author of <i>If Beale Street Could Talk </i>and <i>Go Tell It\
  \ on the Mountain</i>. It consists of two \"letters,\" written on the occasion of\
  \ the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, that exhort Americans, both black\
  \ and white, to attack the terrible legacy of racism. Described by\_<i>The New York\
  \ Times Book Review</i>\_as \"sermon, ultimatum, confession, deposition, testament,\
  \ and chronicle...all presented in searing, brilliant prose,\"\_<i>The Fire Next\
  \ Time</i>\_stands as a classic of literature."
