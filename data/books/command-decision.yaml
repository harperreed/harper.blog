description: "With the Vatta\u2019s War series, award-winning author Elizabeth Moon\
  \ has claimed a place alongside such preeminent writers of military science fiction\
  \ as David Weber and Lois McMaster Bujold. Now Moon is back\u2013and so is her butt-kicking,\
  \ take-no-prisoners heroine, Kylara Vatta. Once the black-sheep scion of a prosperous\
  \ merchant family, Kylara now leads a motley space force dedicated to the defeat\
  \ of a rapacious pirate empire led by the mysterious Gammis Turek. <br /><br />After\
  \ orchestrating a galaxy-wide failure of the communications network owned and maintained\
  \ by the powerful ISC corporation, Turek and his marauders strike swiftly and without\
  \ mercy. First they shatter Vatta Transport. Then they overrun entire star systems,\
  \ growing stronger and bolder. No one is safe from the pirate fleet. But while they\
  \ continue to move forward with their diabolical plan, they have made two critical\
  \ mistakes.<br /><br />Their first mistake was killing Kylara Vatta\u2019s family.<br\
  \ />Their second mistake was leaving her alive.<br />Now Kylara is going to make\
  \ them pay.<b>\n  <br />\n  <br />\n</b>But with a \u201Cfleet\u201D consisting\
  \ of only three ships\u2013including her flagship, the Vanguard, a souped-up merchant\
  \ cruiser\u2013Kylara needs allies, and fast. Because even though she possesses\
  \ the same coveted communication technology as the enemy, she has nowhere near their\
  \ numbers or firepower.<br /><br />Meanwhile, as Kylara\u2019s cousin Stella tries\
  \ to bring together the shattered pieces of the family trading empire, new treachery\
  \ is unfolding at ISC headquarters, where undercover agent Rafael Dunbarger, estranged\
  \ son of the corporation\u2019s CEO, is trying to learn why the damaged network\
  \ is not being repaired. What he discovers will send shock waves across the galaxy\
  \ and crashing into Kylara\u2019s newly christened Space Defense Force at the worst\
  \ possible moment.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"
