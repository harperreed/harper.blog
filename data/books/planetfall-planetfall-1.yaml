description: "From the award-nominated author Emma Newman, comes a novel of how one\
  \ secret withheld to protect humanity\u2019s future might be its undoing\u2026<br\
  \ /><br />Renata Ghali believed in Lee Suh-Mi\u2019s vision of a world far beyond\
  \ Earth, calling to humanity. A planet promising to reveal the truth about our place\
  \ in the cosmos, untainted by overpopulation, pollution, and war. Ren believed in\
  \ that vision enough to give up everything to follow Suh-Mi into the unknown. <br\
  \ /><br />More than twenty-two years have passed since Ren and the rest of the faithful\
  \ braved the starry abyss and established a colony at the base of an enigmatic alien\
  \ structure where Suh-Mi has since resided, alone. All that time, Ren has worked\
  \ hard as the colony's 3-D printer engineer, creating the tools necessary for human\
  \ survival in an alien environment, and harboring a devastating secret.<br /><br\
  \ />Ren continues to perpetuate the lie forming the foundation of the colony for\
  \ the good of her fellow colonists, despite the personal cost. Then a stranger appears,\
  \ far too young to have been part of the first planetfall, a man who bears a remarkable\
  \ resemblance to Suh-Mi. <br /><br />The truth Ren has concealed since planetfall\
  \ can no longer be hidden. And its revelation might tear the colony apart\u2026"
