description: '<strong>A rollicking, irreverent look behind the scenes of the wild
  world of American politics from one of the most sought-after operatives in the Democratic
  Party.</strong><br /><br />Lis Smith isn''t your average political strategist and
  <em>Any Given Tuesday </em>isn''t your typical political memoir. At once a revealing
  look at human nature at the highest levels of power and an intimate portrayal of
  a sometimes rocky personal journey, it breaks all the rules. Smith doesn''t pretend
  to be perfect- she owns the controversial choices that landed her on the cover of
  tabloids, as well as the unorthodox ones that have paid off and defined her successful
  career.<br /><br /><em>Any Given Tuesday</em> follows Smith from her earliest experiences
  as a wide-eyed intern sleeping in her car to her days as a trusted adviser and confidante
  to some of the most high-profile politicians in the country --including her star
  turn as senior adviser on Pete Buttigieg''s 2020 presidential campaign. Animated
  by Smith''s love for the hand-to-hand combat of politics and sustained by her deeply-held
  belief that it''s still possible to effect positive change, it''s an odyssey full
  of highs and lows and larger-than-life characters. Throughout, Smith shows what
  it''s really like behind the curtain: what happens when the lights go down and the
  cameras turn off, how it feels to be in the eye of the political media storm, and
  how the people responsible for heady, life and death decisions are as flawed as
  the rest of us.<br /><br />While the journey hasn''t always been smooth, Lis Smith
  has seen and learned a lot--and she shares it all in this eye-opening, wildly entertaining
  memoir.'
