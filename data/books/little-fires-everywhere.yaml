description: "<p>\n  <i>Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer:\
  \ how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the\
  \ bend and burned the house down. </i>\n</p><p>In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive\
  \ suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned \u2013 from the layout\
  \ of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its\
  \ residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena\
  \ Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.</p><p>Enter Mia Warren\
  \ \u2013 an enigmatic artist and single mother \u2013 who arrives in this idyllic\
  \ bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons.\
  \ Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children\
  \ are drawn to the alluring mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious\
  \ past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered\
  \ community.</p><p>When the Richardsons' friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American\
  \ baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town and puts Mia\
  \ and Mrs. Richardson on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Mrs.\
  \ Richardson becomes determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession\
  \ will come at unexpected and devastating costs to her own family \u2013 and Mia's.\
  \ </p><p><i>Little Fires Everywhere</i> explores the weight of long-held secrets\
  \ and the ferocious pull of motherhood-and the danger of believing that planning\
  \ and following the rules can avert disaster, or heartbreak.</p>"
