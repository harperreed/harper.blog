description: "<strong>A startling debut about class and race, <em>Lakewood</em> evokes\
  \ a terrifying world of medical experimentation\u2014part <em>The Handmaid\u2019\
  s Tale</em>, part <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.</em></strong><br /><br\
  \ />When Lena Johnson\u2019s beloved grandmother dies, and the full extent of the\
  \ family debt is revealed, the black millennial drops out of college to support\
  \ her family and takes a job in the mysterious and remote town of Lakewood, Michigan.<br\
  \ /><br />On paper, her new job is too good to be true. High paying. No out of pocket\
  \ medical expenses. A free place to live. All Lena has to do is participate in a\
  \ secret program\u2014and lie to her friends and family about the research being\
  \ done in Lakewood. An eye drop that makes brown eyes blue, a medication that could\
  \ be a cure for dementia, golden pills promised to make all bad thoughts go away.<br\
  \ /><br />The discoveries made in Lakewood, Lena is told, will change the world\u2014\
  but the consequences for the subjects involved could be devastating. As the truths\
  \ of the program reveal themselves, Lena learns how much she\u2019s willing to sacrifice\
  \ for the sake of her family.<br /><br />Provocative and thrilling, <em>Lakewood</em>\
  \ is a breathtaking novel that takes an unflinching look at the moral dilemmas many\
  \ working-class families face, and the horror that has been forced on black bodies\
  \ in the name of science."
