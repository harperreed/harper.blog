description: "Not too long from now, when exiles from a blistering Earth huddle miserably\
  \ in Martian colonies, the only things that make life bearable are the drugs. Can-D\
  \ \u201Ctranslates\u201D those who take it into the bodies of Barbie-like dolls.\
  \ Now there's competition \u2014 a substance called Chew-Z, marketed under the slogan:\
  \ \u201CGod promises eternal life. We can deliver it.\u201D The question is: What\
  \ kind of eternity? And who \u2014 or what \u2014 is the deliverer?<br /><br />In\
  \ this wildly disorienting funhouse of a novel, populated by God-like \u2014 or\
  \ perhaps Satanic \u2014 takeover artists and corporate psychics, Philip K. Dick\
  \ explores mysteries that were once the property of St. Paul and Aquinas. His wit,\
  \ compassion, and knife-edged irony make <i>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</i>\
  \ moving as well as genuinely visionary.<br /><br />"
