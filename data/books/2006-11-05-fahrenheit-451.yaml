description: "<b>Ray Bradbury\u2019s internationally acclaimed novel <i>Fahrenheit\
  \ 451</i> is a masterwork of twentieth-century literature set in a bleak, dystopian\
  \ future. </b><br /><br />Guy Montag is a fireman. In his world, where television\
  \ rules and literature is on the brink of extinction, firemen start fires rather\
  \ than put them out. His job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the\
  \ printed book, along with the houses in which they are hidden. <br /><br />Montag\
  \ never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day\
  \ to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television \u201C\
  family.\u201D But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces\
  \ him to a past where people didn\u2019t live in fear and to a present where one\
  \ sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television.\
  \ <br /><br />When Mildred attempts suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag\
  \ begins to question everything he has ever known. He starts hiding books in his\
  \ home, and when his pilfering is discovered, the fireman has to run for his life."
