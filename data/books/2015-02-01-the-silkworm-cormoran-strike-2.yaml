description: "<b>Private investigator Cormoran Strike returns in a new mystery from\
  \ Robert Galbraith, author of the #1 international bestseller <i>The Cuckoo's Calling</i>.</b><br\
  \ /><br />When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective\
  \ Cormoran Strike. At first, Mrs. Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by\
  \ himself for a few days\u2014as he has done before\u2014and she wants Strike to\
  \ find him and bring him home.<br /><br />But as Strike investigates, it becomes\
  \ clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realizes. The\
  \ novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of\
  \ almost everyone he knows. If the novel were to be published, it would ruin lives\u2014\
  meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced.<br /><br />When\
  \ Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race\
  \ against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike\
  \ any Strike has encountered before..."
