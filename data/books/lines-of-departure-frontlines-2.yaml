description: Vicious interstellar conflict with an indestructible alien species. Bloody
  civil war over the last habitable zones of the cosmos. Political unrest, militaristic
  police forces, dire threats to the solar system<br /><br />Humanity is on the ropes,
  and after years of fighting a two-front war with losing odds, so is Commonwealth
  Defense Corps officer Andrew Grayson. He dreams of dropping out of the service one
  day, alongside his pilot girlfriend, but as warfare consumes entire planets and
  conditions on Earth deteriorate, he wonders if there will be anywhere left for them
  to go.<br /><br />After surviving a disastrous spaceborne assault, Grayson is reassigned
  to a ship bound for a distant colony and packed with malcontents and troublemakers.
  His most dangerous battle has just begun.<br /><br />In this sequel to the bestselling
  "Terms of Enlistment," a weary soldier must fight to prevent the downfall of his
  species or bear witness to humanity s last, fleeting breaths.<br /><br />"
