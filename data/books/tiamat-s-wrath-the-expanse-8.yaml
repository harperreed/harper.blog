description: "Thirteen hundred gates have opened to solar systems around the galaxy.\
  \ But as humanity builds its interstellar empire in the alien ruins, the mysteries\
  \ and threats grow deeper.<br /><br />In the dead systems where gates lead to stranger\
  \ things than alien planets, Elvi Okoye begins a desperate search to discover the\
  \ nature of a genocide that happened before the first human beings existed, and\
  \ to find weapons to fight a war against forces at the edge of the imaginable. But\
  \ the price of that knowledge may be higher than she can pay.<br /><br />At the\
  \ heart of the empire, Teresa Duarte prepares to take on the burden of her father\u2019\
  s godlike ambition. The sociopathic scientist Paolo Cort\xE1zar and the Mephistophelian\
  \ prisoner James Holden are only two of the dangers in a palace thick with intrigue,\
  \ but Teresa has a mind of her own and secrets even her father the emperor doesn\u2019\
  t guess. <br /><br />And throughout the wide human empire, the scattered crew of\
  \ the <i>Rocinante</i> fights a brave rear-guard action against Duarte\u2019s authoritarian\
  \ regime. Memory of the old order falls away, and a future under Laconia\u2019s\
  \ eternal rule \u2014 and with it, a battle that humanity can only lose \u2013 seems\
  \ more and more certain. Because against the terrors that lie between worlds, courage\
  \ and ambition will not be enough\u2026"
