description: Winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards, John Varley is truly one of the
  "greats" of science fiction, comparable only to Heinlein, Herbert, Asimov, and Clark.
  Now the all-time master returns -- with his long-awaited epic novel of life beyond
  the great beyond...All the universe is a stage, and Sparky Valentine is its itinerant
  thespian. He makes his way from planet to planet as part of a motley theater troupe,
  bringing Shakespeare -- a version of it anyway -- to the outer reaches of earth's
  solar system. He journeys through the outlands, where thousands of artificial satellites
  drift, conglomerates of junk and rock welded together to support meager communities
  of human life. Here Sparky plies his trade, transforming himself from young to old,
  fat to thin, man to woman, by altering magnetic implants beneath his skin. Indispensable
  hardware for a career actor and an interstellar con man wanted for murder -- for
  while Sparky Valentine may have a song in his heart, he also has a price on his
  head. But his galactic roamings are bringing him closer to home, closer to justice
  -- and closer to the truth of his strange and prolonged existence...
