description: "The silicon revolution left Dremmler behind, but a good detective is\
  \ never obsolete.<br /><br />London is quiet in 2039\u2014thanks to the machines.\
  \ People stay indoors, communicating through high-tech glasses and gorging on simulated\
  \ reality while 3D printers and scuttling robots cater to their every whim. Mammoth\
  \ corporations wage war for dominance in a world where human augmentation blurs\
  \ the line between flesh and steel. <br /><br />And at the center of it all lurks\
  \ The Imagination Machine: the hyper-advanced, omnipresent AI that drives our cars,\
  \ flies our planes, cooks our food, and plans our lives. Servile, patient, tireless\
  \ \u2026 TIM has everything humanity requires. Everything except a soul.<br /><br\
  \ />Through this silicon jungle prowls Carl Dremmler, police detective\u2014one\
  \ of the few professions better suited to meat than machine. His latest case: a\
  \ grisly murder seemingly perpetrated by the victim\u2019s boyfriend. Dremmler\u2019\
  s boss wants a quick end to the case, but the tech-wary detective can\u2019t help\
  \ but believe the accused\u2019s bizarre story: that his robotic arm committed the\
  \ heinous crime, not him. An advanced prosthetic, controlled by a chip in his skull.\
  \ <br /><br />A chip controlled by TIM.<br /><br />Dremmler smells blood: the seeds\
  \ of a conspiracy that could burn London to ash unless he exposes the truth. His\
  \ investigation pits him against desperate criminals, scheming businesswomen, deadly\
  \ automatons\u2014and the nightmares of his own past. And when Dremmler finds himself\
  \ questioning even TIM\u2019s inscrutable motives, he\u2019s forced to stare into\
  \ the blank soul of the machine. <br /><br />Auxiliary is gripping, unpredictable,\
  \ and bleakly atmospheric\u2014ideal for fans of cyberpunk classics like the Blade\
  \ Runner movies, Richard K. Morgan\u2019s Altered Carbon, William Gibson\u2019s\
  \ Neuromancer, and the Netflix original series Black Mirror."
