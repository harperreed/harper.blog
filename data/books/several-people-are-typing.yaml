description: "A <i>Good Morning America</i> Book Club Pick! \u2022 A work-from-home\
  \ comedy where WFH meets WTF.<br /> <br />\u201CAn absurd, hilarious romp through\
  \ the haunted house of late-stage capitalism.\u201D\u2014Carmen Maria Machado, author\
  \ of <i>In the Dream House</i><br /> <br />Told entirely through clever and captivating\
  \ Slack messages, this irresistible, relatable satire of both virtual work and contemporary\
  \ life is <i>The Office</i> for a new world.<br /><br />Gerald, a mid-level employee\
  \ of a New York\u2013based public relations firm has been uploaded into the company\u2019\
  s internal Slack channels\u2014at least his consciousness has. His colleagues assume\
  \ it\u2019s an elaborate gag to exploit the new work-from home policy, but now that\
  \ Gerald\u2019s productivity is through the roof, his bosses are only too happy\
  \ to let him work from . . . wherever he says he is.<br /> <br />Faced with the\
  \ looming abyss of a disembodied life online, Gerald enlists his co-worker Pradeep\
  \ to help him escape, and to find out what happened to his body. But the longer\
  \ Gerald stays in the void, the more alluring and absurd his reality becomes.<br\
  \ /> <br />Meanwhile, Gerald\u2019s colleagues have PR catastrophes of their own\
  \ to handle in the real world. Their biggest client, a high-end dog food company,\
  \ is in the midst of recalling a bad batch of food that\u2019s allegedly poisoning\
  \ Pomeranians nationwide. And their CEO suspects someone is sabotaging his office\
  \ furniture. And if Gerald gets to work from home all the time, why can\u2019t everyone?\
  \ Is true love possible between two people, when one is just a line of text in an\
  \ app? And what in the hell does the :dusty-stick: emoji mean?<br /> <br />In a\
  \ time when office paranoia and politics have followed us home, Calvin Kasulke is\
  \ here to capture the surprising, absurd, and fully-relatable factors attacking\
  \ our collective sanity\u2026and give us hope that we can still find a human connection."
