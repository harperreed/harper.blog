description: "<b></b>Murder Was Never So Much Fun! <p> When Disco Bloodbath was first\
  \ published, it created a storm of controversy for its startlingly vivid, strikingly\
  \ fresh, and outrageously funny depiction of the hedonistic world of the New York\
  \ City club kids, for whom nothing was too outr\xE9 -- including murder. Nominated\
  \ for the Edgar Award for best true-crime book of the year, it also marked the debut\
  \ of an audaciously talented writer, James St. James, who himself had been a club\
  \ kid and close friend and confidant of Michael Alig, the young man convicted of\
  \ killing the drug dealer known as Angel. </p><p> Now the book has been brought\
  \ to the screen as <i>Party Monster,</i> with Macaulay Culkin playing killer Michael\
  \ Alig and Seth Green as author/celebutante James St. James.</p>"
