description: They call it Company Town--a city-sized oil rig off the coast of the
  Canadian Maritimes, now owned by one very wealthy, powerful, byzantine Lynch Ltd.<br
  /><br />Hwa is of the few people in her community (which constitutes the whole rig)
  to forgo bio-engineered enhancements. As such, she's the last truly organic person
  left on the rig--making her doubly an outsider, as well as a neglected daughter
  and bodyguard extraordinaire. Still, her expertise in the arts of self-defense and
  her record as a fighter mean that her services are yet in high demand. When the
  youngest Lynch needs training and protection, the family turns to Hwa. But can even
  she protect against increasingly intense death threats seemingly coming from another
  timeline?<br /><br />Meanwhile, a series of interconnected murders threatens the
  city's stability and heightens the unease of a rig turning over. All signs point
  to a nearly invisible serial killer, but all of the murders seem to lead right back
  to Hwa's front door. Company Town has never been the safest place to be--but now,
  the danger is personal.<br /><br />A brilliant, twisted mystery, as one woman must
  evaluate saving the people of a town that can't be saved, or saving herself.<br
  /><br />At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights
  Management Software (DRM) applied.
