description: 'Philippe Bourgois''s ethnographic study of social marginalization in
  inner-city America, won critical acclaim when it was first published in 1995. For
  the first time, an anthropologist had managed to gain the trust and long-term friendship
  of street-level drug dealers in one of the roughest ghetto neighborhoods--East Harlem.
  This new edition adds a prologue describing the major dynamics that have altered
  life on the streets of East Harlem in the seven years since the first edition. In
  a new epilogue Bourgois brings up to date the stories of the people--Primo, Caesat,
  Luis, Tony, Candy--who readers come to know in this remarkable window onto the world
  of the inner city drug trade. Philippe Bourgois is Professor and Chair of the Department
  of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine at the University of California, San
  Francisco. He has conducted fieldwork in Central America on ethnicity and social
  unrest and is the author of Ethnicity at Work: Divided Labor on a Central American
  Banana Plantation (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989). He is writing a book on
  homeless heroin addicts in San Francisco. 1/e hb ISBN (1996) 0-521-43518-8 1/e pb
