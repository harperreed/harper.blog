description: 'Not too long from today, a new, highly contagious virus makes its way
  across the globe. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and
  headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the
  United States alone - the disease causes "Lock In": Victims fully awake and aware,
  but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich,
  poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge.<br
  /><br />A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what''s now known as
  "Haden''s syndrome," rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie
  Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at
  the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an "integrator" - someone who can let
  the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden
  client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.<br
  /><br />But "complicated" doesn''t begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began
  to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and
  the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked
  in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will
  seize at any cost. The investigation that began as a murder case takes Shane and
  Vann from the halls of corporate power to the virtual spaces of the locked in, and
  to the very heart of an emerging, surprising new human culture. It''s nothing you
  could have expected.'
