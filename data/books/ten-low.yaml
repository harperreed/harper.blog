description: '<b><i>Firefly</i> meets <i>Dune</i> in a breakneck race to escape across
  an alien moon thriving with aliens and criminals.</b><br /><br />Ten Low is an ex-army
  medic, one of many convicts eking out a living at the universe''s edge. She''s desperate
  to escape her memories of the interstellar war, and the crimes she committed, but
  trouble seems to follow wherever she goes. One night, attempting to atone for her
  sins, she pulls a teenage girl - the sole survivor - from the wreck of a spaceship.
  But Gabriella Ortiz is no ordinary girl. The result of a military genetics programme,
  she is a decorated Army General, from the opposing side of the war to Ten. Worse,
  Ten realises the crash was an assassination attempt, and that someone wants the
  Ortiz dead... <br /><br />The pair bury their hatreds and strike an uneasy deal
  to smuggle the General off-world. Their road won''t be easy: they must cross the
  moon''s lawless wastes, facing military hit squads, bandits and the one-eyed leader
  of an all-female road gang, in a frantic race to get the General to safety. But
  something else waits in the darkness at the universe''s edge. Something that threatens
  to reveal Ten''s worst nightmare: the truth of who she really is and what she is
  running from.'
