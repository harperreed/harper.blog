description: '<i>Alternate Cover Edition can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34554132-we-are-legion"
  rel="nofollow">here</a>. </i><br /><br />Bob Johansson has just sold his software
  company and is looking forward to a life of leisure. There are places to go, books
  to read, and movies to watch. So it''s a little unfair when he gets himself killed
  crossing the street. <br /> <br />Bob wakes up a century later to find that corpsicles
  have been declared to be without rights, and he is now the property of the state.
  He has been uploaded into computer hardware and is slated to be the controlling
  AI in an interstellar probe looking for habitable planets. The stakes are high:
  no less than the first claim to entire worlds. If he declines the honor, he''ll
  be switched off, and they''ll try again with someone else. If he accepts, he becomes
  a prime target. There are at least three other countries trying to get their own
  probes launched first, and they play dirty. <br /> <br />The safest place for Bob
  is in space, heading away from Earth at top speed. Or so he thinks. Because the
  universe is full of nasties, and trespassers make them mad - very mad.'
