description: "The fourth novel of the galaxy-spanning Sun Eater series merges the\
  \ best of space opera and epic fantasy, as Hadrian Marlowe continues down a path\
  \ that can only end in fire.<br /><br />Hadrian Marlowe is trapped.<br /> <br />For\
  \ nearly a century, he has been a guest of the Emperor, forced into the role of\
  \ advisor, a prisoner of his own legend. But the war is changing. Mankind is losing.<br\
  \ /> <br />The Cielcin are spilling into human space from the fringes, picking their\
  \ targets with cunning precision. The Great Prince Syriani Dorayaica is uniting\
  \ their clans, forging them into an army and threat the likes of which mankind has\
  \ never seen.<br /> <br />And the Empire stands alone.<br /> <br />Now the Emperor\
  \ has no choice but to give Hadrian Marlowe\u2014once his favorite knight\u2014\
  one more impossible task: journey across the galaxy to the Lothrian Commonwealth\
  \ and convince them to join the war. But not all is as it seems, and Hadrian\u2019\
  s journey will take him far beyond the Empire, beyond the Commonwealth, impossibly\
  \ deep behind enemy lines."
