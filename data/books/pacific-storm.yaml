description: "Ava Arnett is a Honolulu cop, captain of the night shift in the autonomous\
  \ Waikiki District. Nine years ago a massive hurricane hit the island. Ava remains\
  \ haunted by the mistakes she made and the lives she failed to save during that\
  \ disaster. Since then, she relies on HADAFA, an AI designed to observe, analyze,\
  \ and predict human behavior. HADAFA monitors her actions, and its assessments guide\
  \ her decisions.<br /><br />Now, another Category 5 hurricane is approaching Honolulu\u2026\
  \ In the hectic hours before landfall, Ava stumbles into a terrorist conspiracy\
  \ \u2013 and HADAFA begins to glitch. She can no longer rely on the AI. She must\
  \ decide on her own whether or not to trust a mysterious federal agent named Lyric\
  \ Jones \u2013 knowing the wrong choice could lead to greater devastation... and\
  \ a war no one will win."
