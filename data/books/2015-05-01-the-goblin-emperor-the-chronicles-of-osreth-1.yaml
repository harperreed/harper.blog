description: "The youngest, half-goblin son of the Emperor has lived his entire life\
  \ in exile, distant from the Imperial Court and the deadly intrigue that suffuses\
  \ it. But when his father and three sons in line for the throne are killed in an\
  \ \"accident,\" he has no choice but to take his place as the only surviving rightful\
  \ heir.<br /><br />Entirely unschooled in the art of court politics, he has no friends,\
  \ no advisors, and the sure knowledge that whoever assassinated his father and brothers\
  \ could make an attempt on his life at any moment.<br /><br />Surrounded by sycophants\
  \ eager to curry favor with the na\xEFve new emperor, and overwhelmed by the burdens\
  \ of his new life, he can trust nobody. Amid the swirl of plots to depose him, offers\
  \ of arranged marriages, and the specter of the unknown conspirators who lurk in\
  \ the shadows, he must quickly adjust to life as the Goblin Emperor. All the while,\
  \ he is alone, and trying to find even a single friend... and hoping for the possibility\
  \ of romance, yet also vigilant against the unseen enemies that threaten him, lest\
  \ he lose his throne \u2013 or his life."
