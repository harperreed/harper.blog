description: "<strong>Remember when presidents spoke in complete sentences instead\
  \ of in unhinged tweets? David Litt does. In his comic, coming-of-age memoir, he\
  \ takes us back to the Obama years \u2013 and charts a path forward in the age of\
  \ Trump</strong><br /><br />More than any other presidency, Barack Obama\u2019s\
  \ eight years in the White House were defined by young people \u2013 twenty-somethings\
  \ who didn\u2019t have much experience in politics (or anything else, for that matter),\
  \ yet suddenly found themselves in the most high-stakes office building on earth.\
  \ David Litt was one of those twenty-somethings. After graduating from college in\
  \ 2008, he went straight to the Obama campaign. In 2011, he became one of the youngest\
  \ White House speechwriters in history. Until leaving the White House in 2016, he\
  \ wrote on topics from healthcare to climate change to criminal justice reform.\
  \ As President Obama\u2019s go-to comedy writer, he also took the lead on the White\
  \ House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, the so-called \u201CState of the Union of jokes.\u201D\
  <br /><br />Now, in this refreshingly honest memoir, Litt brings us inside Obamaworld.\
  \ With a humorists\u2019 eye for detail, he describes what it\u2019s like to accidentally\
  \ trigger an international incident or nearly set a president\u2019s hair aflame.\
  \ He answers questions you never knew you had: Which White House men\u2019s room\
  \ is the classiest? What do you do when the commander in chief gets your name wrong?\
  \ Where should you never, under any circumstances, change clothes on Air Force One?\
  \ With nearly a decade of stories to tell, Litt makes clear that politics is completely,\
  \ hopelessly absurd.\_\_\_<br /><br />But it\u2019s also important. For all the\
  \ moments of chaos, frustration, and yes, disillusionment, Litt remains a believer\
  \ in the words that first drew him to the Obama campaign: \u201CPeople who love\
  \ this country can change it.\u201D In telling his own story, Litt sheds fresh light\
  \ on his former boss\u2019s legacy. And he argues that, despite the current political\
  \ climate, the politics championed by Barack Obama will outlive the presidency of\
  \ Donald Trump.<br /><br />Full of hilarious stories and told in a truly original\
  \ voice,\_<em>Thanks, Obama</em>\_is an exciting debut about what it means \u2013\
  \ personally, professionally, and politically \u2013 to grow up."
