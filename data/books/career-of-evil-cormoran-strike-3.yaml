description: "<i>Cormoran Strike is back, with his assistant Robin Ellacott, in a\
  \ mystery based around soldiers returning from war.</i><br /><br />When a mysterious\
  \ package is delivered to Robin Ellacott, she is horrified to discover that it contains\
  \ a woman\u2019s severed leg.<br /><br />Her boss, private detective Cormoran Strike,\
  \ is less surprised but no less alarmed. There are four people from his past who\
  \ he thinks could be responsible \u2013 and Strike knows that any one of them is\
  \ capable of sustained and unspeakable brutality.<br /><br />With the police focusing\
  \ on the one suspect Strike is increasingly sure is not the perpetrator, he and\
  \ Robin take matters into their own hands, and delve into the dark and twisted worlds\
  \ of the other three men. But as more horrendous acts occur, time is running out\
  \ for the two of them\u2026<br /><br /><i>Career of Evil</i> is the third in the\
  \ series featuring private detective Cormoran Strike and his assistant Robin Ellacott.\
  \ A mystery and also a story of a man and a woman at a crossroads in their personal\
  \ and professional lives."
