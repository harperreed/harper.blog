description: "<i>Scarred by war. In pursuit of truth.</i><br /><br />Army veteran\
  \ True Brighton left the service when the development of robotic helicopters made\
  \ her training as a pilot obsolete. Now she works at Requisite Operations, a private\
  \ military company established by friend and former Special Ops soldier Lincoln\
  \ Han. ReqOp has embraced the new technologies. Robotics, big data, and artificial\
  \ intelligence are all tools used to augment the skills of veteran warfighters-for-hire.\
  \ But the tragedy of war is still measured in human casualties, and when True makes\
  \ a chance discovery during a rescue mission, old wounds are ripped open. She\u2019\
  s left questioning what she knows of the past, and resolves to pursue the truth,\
  \ whatever the cost.<br /><br /><i>The Last Good Man</i> is a powerful, complex,\
  \ and very human tale."
