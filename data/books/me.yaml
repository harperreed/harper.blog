description: "Moth has lost her family in an accident. Though she lives with her aunt,\
  \ she feels alone and uprooted.<br /><br />Until she meets Sani, a boy who is also\
  \ searching for his roots. If he knows more about where he comes from, maybe he\u2019\
  ll be able to understand his ongoing depression. And if Moth can help him feel grounded,\
  \ then perhaps she too will discover the history she carries in her bones.<br /><br\
  \ />Moth and Sani take a road trip that has them chasing ghosts and searching for\
  \ ancestors. The way each moves forward is surprising, powerful, and unforgettable.<br\
  \ /><br />Here is an exquisite and uplifting novel about identity, first love, and\
  \ the ways that our memories and our roots steer us through the universe."
