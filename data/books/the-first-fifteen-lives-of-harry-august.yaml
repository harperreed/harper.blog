description: Some stories cannot be told in just one lifetime. Harry August is on
  his deathbed. Again.<br />No matter what he does or the decisions he makes, when
  death comes, Harry always returns to where he began, a child with all the knowledge
  of a life he has already lived a dozen times before. Nothing ever changes. <br />Until
  now. <br />As Harry nears the end of his eleventh life, a little girl appears at
  his bedside. "I nearly missed you, Doctor August," she says. "I need to send a message."<br
  />This is the story of what Harry does next, and what he did before, and how he
  tries to save a past he cannot change and a future he cannot allow.
