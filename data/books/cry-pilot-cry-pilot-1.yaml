description: 'A devastated Earth. Rogue bio-weapons. And a recruit with secrets. In
  this explosive new military science fiction novel, a tight-knit infantry squad is
  thrown into battle against a mysterious enemy that appears without warning and strikes
  without mercy.<br /><br />There''s only one way for a man with Maseo Kaytu''s secrets
  to join the military: by volunteering for a suicide mission as a ''cry pilot''.
  He cheats the system to survive, but you can''t fake basic training. Assigned to
  a squad of misfits, Kaytu learns how to fight, how to obey, and how to trust. Yet
  the more he bonds with his fellow recruits, the more he risks exposure of his criminal
  past. <br /><br />Keeping his secret is about to become the least of his problems.
  Kaytu discovers that his platoon is being deployed against a new kind of rogue bio-weapon.
  One that has torn apart every military force it''s ever faced . . . .'
