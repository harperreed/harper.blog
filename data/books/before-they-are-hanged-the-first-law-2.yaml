description: "Superior Glokta has a problem. How do you defend a city surrounded by\
  \ enemies and riddled with traitors, when your allies can by no means be trusted,\
  \ and your predecessor vanished without a trace? It\u2019s enough to make a torturer\
  \ want to run \u2013 if he could even walk without a stick.<br /><br />Northmen\
  \ have spilled over the border of Angland and are spreading fire and death across\
  \ the frozen country. Crown Prince Ladisla is poised to drive them back and win\
  \ undying glory. There is only one problem \u2013 he commands the worst-armed, worst-trained,\
  \ worst-led army in the world.<br /><br />And Bayaz, the First of the Magi, is leading\
  \ a party of bold adventurers on a perilous mission through the ruins of the past.\
  \ The most hated woman in the South, the most feared man in the North, and the most\
  \ selfish boy in the Union make a strange alliance, but a deadly one. They might\
  \ even stand a chance of saving mankind from the Eaters. If they didn\u2019t hate\
  \ each other quite so much.<br /><br />Ancient secrets will be uncovered. Bloody\
  \ battles will be won and lost. Bitter enemies will be forgiven \u2013 but not before\
  \ they are hanged."
