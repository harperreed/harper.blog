description: "<b>Cory Doctorow's <i>Attack Surface</i> is a standalone novel set in\
  \ the world of<i> New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Little Brother</i> and <i>Homeland</i>.</b><br\
  \ /><br />Most days, Masha Maximow was sure she'd chosen the winning side.<br /><br\
  \ />In her day job as a counterterrorism wizard for an transnational cybersecurity\
  \ firm, she made the hacks that allowed repressive regimes to spy on dissidents,\
  \ and manipulate their every move. The perks were fantastic, and the pay was obscene.<br\
  \ /><br />Just for fun, and to piss off her masters, Masha sometimes used her mad\
  \ skills to help those same troublemakers evade detection, if their cause was just.\
  \ It was a dangerous game and a hell of a rush. But seriously self-destructive.\
  \ And unsustainable.<br /><br />When her targets were strangers in faraway police\
  \ states, it was easy to compartmentalize, to ignore the collateral damage of murder,\
  \ rape, and torture. But when it hits close to home, and the hacks and exploits\
  \ she\u2019s devised are directed at her friends and family--including boy wonder\
  \ Marcus Yallow, her old crush and archrival, and his entourage of na\xEFve idealists--Masha\
  \ realizes she has to choose.<br /><br />And whatever choice she makes, someone\
  \ is going to get hurt."
