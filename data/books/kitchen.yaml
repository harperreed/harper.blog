description: Banana Yoshimoto's novels have made her a sensation in Japan and all
  over the world, and <i>Kitchen</i>, the dazzling English-language debut that is
  still her best-loved book, is an enchantingly original and deeply affecting book
  about mothers, love, tragedy, and the power of the kitchen and home in the lives
  of a pair of free-spirited young women in contemporary Japan. Mikage, the heroine
  of <i>Kitchen</i>, is an orphan raised by her grandmother, who has passed away.
  Grieving, she is taken in by her friend Yoichi and his mother (who was once his
  father), Eriko. As the three of them form an improvised family that soon weathers
  its own tragic losses, Yoshimoto spins a lovely, evocative tale that recalls early
  Marguerite Duras. <i>Kitchen</i> and its companion story, "Moonlight Shadow," are
  elegant tales whose seeming simplicity is the ruse of a writer whose voice echoes
  in the mind and the soul.
