description: "<b>Reminiscent of China Mi\xE9ville and Octavia Butler, Jennifer Marie\
  \ Brissett, author of <i>Elysium</i>, has created a disturbing and haunting sf narrative\
  \ in <i>Destroyer of Light</i>, interweaving mythology with interdimensional aliens,\
  \ human refuges, child soldiers, and genetic engineering.</b><br /><br />Over three\
  \ hundred years in the future, all humans on the planet Eleusis are refugees following\
  \ the alien destruction of Earth.<br /><br />Within this society of haves and have-nots,\
  \ of criminals and dissidents, of former alien conquerors claiming a desire for\
  \ peaceful cohabitation, three stories intertwine: a young girl abducted by a violent\
  \ warlord, twin brothers searching for the lost son of a human/alien couple, and\
  \ a young woman with extraordinary powers who\u2019s risen through the insurgent\
  \ ranks in the borderlands called Night.<br /><br />Their stories skate across years\
  \ to build towards one moment, when the fate of all\u2014human and alien\u2014hangs\
  \ in the balance."
