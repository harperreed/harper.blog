description: "<b>#1 <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling phenomenon Patrick Rothfuss\
  \ returns to the wildly popular Kingkiller Chronicle universe with a stunning reimagining\
  \ of \"The Lightning Tree.\" Expanded to twice its previous length and lavishly\
  \ illustrated by Nathan Taylor, this touching stand-alone story is sure to please\
  \ new readers and veteran Rothfuss fans alike.</b><br /><br />Bast knows how to\
  \ bargain. The give-and-take of a negotiation is as familiar to him as the in-and-out\
  \ of breathing; to watch him trade is to watch an artist at work. But even a master's\
  \ brush can slip. When he accepts a gift, taking something for nothing, Bast's whole\
  \ world is knocked askew, for he knows how to bargain\u2014but not how to owe. <br\
  \ /><br />From dawn to midnight over the course of a single day, follow the Kingkiller\
  \ Chronicle's most charming fae as he schemes and sneaks, dancing into trouble and\
  \ back out again with uncanny grace.<br /><br /><i>The Narrow Road Between Desires</i>\
  \ is Bast's story. In it he traces the old ways of making and breaking, following\
  \ his heart even when doing so goes against his better judgement.<br /><br />After\
  \ all, what good is caution if it keeps him from danger and delight?"
