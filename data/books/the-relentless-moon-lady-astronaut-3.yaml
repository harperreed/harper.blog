      description: "\n\n    Mary Robinette Kowal's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning alternate\
        \ history series expands on the premise behind her award-winning novelette,\
        \ <i>The Lady Astronaut of Mars</i>.\r\n    \r\n    On a cold spring night\
        \ in 1952, a meteorite falls to earth and destroys much of the eastern seaboard\
        \ of the United States, including Washington D.C. The Meteor, as it is popularly\
        \ known, decimates the U.S. government and paves the way for a climate cataclysm\
        \ that will eventually render the earth inhospitable to humanity. This looming\
        \ threat calls for a radically accelerated timeline in the earth's efforts\
        \ to colonize space, and allows a much larger share of humanity to take part\
        \ in the process.\n\n"
