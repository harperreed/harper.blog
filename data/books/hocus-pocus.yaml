description: "Here is the adventure of Eugene Debs Hartke. He's a Vietnam veteran,\
  \ a jazz pianist, a college professor, and a prognosticator of the apocalypse (and\
  \ other things Earth-shattering). But that's neither here no there. Because at Tarkington\
  \ College\u2014where he teaches\u2014the excrement is about to hit the air-conditioning.\
  \ And its all Eugene's fault."
