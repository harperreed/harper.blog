  the best-selling author of <i>The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry</i> two friends--often
  in love, but never lovers--come together as creative partners in the world of video
  game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately,
  a kind of immortality.</b><br /><br />On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his
  junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of
  people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she
  pretends she hasn''t heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary
  collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood,
  borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created
  their first blockbuster, <i> Ichigo</i>. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even
  twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these
  qualities won''t protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals
  of their hearts.<br /><br />Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts,

  <i>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</i> is a dazzling and intricately imagined
  novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the
  redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved
  and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before.'
