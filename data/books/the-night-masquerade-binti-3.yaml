description: The concluding part of the highly-acclaimed science fiction trilogy that
  began with Nnedi Okorafor's Hugo- and Nebula Award-winning BINTI.<br /><br />Binti
  has returned to her home planet, believing that the violence of the Meduse has been
  left behind. Unfortunately, although her people are peaceful on the whole, the same
  cannot be said for the Khoush, who fan the flames of their ancient rivalry with
  the Meduse.<br /><br />Far from her village when the conflicts start, Binti hurries
  home, but anger and resentment has already claimed the lives of many close to her.<br
  /><br />Once again it is up to Binti, and her intriguing new friend Mwinyi, to intervene--though
  the elders of her people do not entirely trust her motives--and try to prevent a
  war that could wipe out her people, once and for all.<br /><br />Don't miss this
  essential concluding volume in the Binti trilogy.
