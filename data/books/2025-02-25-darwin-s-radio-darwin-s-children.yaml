description: "<b>Darwin's Radio</b><br /><br />A 2000 HUGO AWARD NOMINEE<br /><br\
  \ />Greg Bear's powerfully written, brilliantly inventive novels combine cutting-edge\
  \ science and unforgettable characters, illuminating dazzling new technologies--and\
  \ their dangers. Now, in Darwin's Radio, Bear draws on state-of-the-art biological\
  \ and anthropological research to give us an ingeniously plotted thriller that questions\
  \ everything we believe about human origins and destiny--as civilization confronts\
  \ the next terrifying step in evolution.<br /><br />A mass grave in Russia that\
  \ conceals the mummified remains of two women, both with child--and the conspiracy\
  \ to keep it secret . . . a major discovery high in the Alps: the preserved bodies\
  \ of a prehistoric family--the newborn infant possessing disturbing characteristics\
  \ . . . a mysterious disease that strikes only pregnant women, resulting in miscarriage.\
  \ Three disparate facts that will converge into one science-shattering truth.<br\
  \ /><br />Molecular biologist Kaye Lang, a specialist in retroviruses, believes\
  \ that ancient diseases encoded in the DNA of humans can again come to life. But\
  \ her theory soon becomes chilling reality. For Christopher Dicken--a \"virus hunter\"\
  \ at the Epidemic Intelligence Service--has pursued an elusive flu-like disease\
  \ that strikes down expectant mothers and their offspring. The shocking link: something\
  \ that has slept in our genes for millions of years is waking up. <br /><br />Now,\
  \ as the outbreak of this terrifying disease threatens to become a deadly epidemic,\
  \ Dicken and Lang, along with anthropologist Mitch Rafelson, must race against time\
  \ to assemble the pieces of a puzzle only they are equipped to solve. An evolutionary\
  \ puzzle that will determine the future of the human race . . . if a future exists\
  \ at all.<br /><br />A fiercely intelligent, utterly enthralling novel of adventure\
  \ and ideas, genetics and evolution, a fast-paced thriller that is grounded in the\
  \ timeless human themes of struggle, loss, and redemption, Darwin's Radio is sure\
  \ to become one of the most talked-about books of the year.<br /><br /><br /><b>Darwin's\
  \ Children</b><br /><br />Eleven years have passed since SHEVA, an ancient retrovirus,\
  \ was discovered in human DNA\u2014a retrovirus that caused mutations in the human\
  \ genome and heralded the arrival of a new wave of genetically enhanced humans.\
  \ Now these changed children have reached adolescence . . . and face a world that\
  \ is outraged about their very existence. For these special youths, possessed of\
  \ remarkable, advanced traits that mark a major turning point in human development,\
  \ are also ticking time bombs harboring hosts of viruses that could exterminate\
  \ the \u201Cold\u201D human race. <br /><br />Fear and hatred of the virus children\
  \ have made them a persecuted underclass, quarantined by the government in special\
  \ \u201Cschools,\u201D targeted by federally sanctioned bounty hunters, and demonized\
  \ by hysterical segments of the population. But pockets of resistance have sprung\
  \ up among those opposed to treating the children like dangerous diseases\u2014\
  and who fear the worst if the government\u2019s draconian measures are carried to\
  \ their extreme.<br /><br />Scientists Kaye Lang and Mitch Rafelson are part of\
  \ this small but determined minority. Once at the forefront of the discovery and\
  \ study of the SHEVA outbreak, they now live as virtual exiles in the Virginia suburbs\
  \ with their daughter, Stella\u2014a bright, inquisitive virus child who is quickly\
  \ maturing, straining to break free of the protective world her parents have built\
  \ around her, and eager to seek out others of her kind.<br /><br />But for all their\
  \ precautions, Kaye, Mitch, and Stella have not slipped below the government\u2019\
  s radar."
