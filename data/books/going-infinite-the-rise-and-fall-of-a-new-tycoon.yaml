description: "From the #1 best-selling author of The Big Short and Flash Boys , the\
  \ story of FTX\u2019s spectacular collapse and the enigmatic founder at its center.<br\
  \ />When Michael Lewis first met him, Sam Bankman-Fried was the world\u2019s youngest\
  \ billionaire and crypto\u2019s Gatsby. CEOs, celebrities, and leaders of small\
  \ countries all vied for his time and cash after he catapulted, practically overnight,\
  \ onto the Forbes billionaire list. Who was this rumpled guy in cargo shorts and\
  \ limp white socks, whose eyes twitched across Zoom meetings as he played video\
  \ games on the side?<br />In Going Infinite Lewis sets out to answer this question,\
  \ taking readers into the mind of Bankman-Fried, whose rise and fall offers an education\
  \ in high-frequency trading, cryptocurrencies, philanthropy, bankruptcy, and the\
  \ justice system. Both psychological portrait and financial roller-coaster ride,\
  \ Going Infinite is Michael Lewis at the top of his game, tracing the mind-bending\
  \ trajectory of a character who never liked the rules and was allowed to live by\
  \ his own\u2014until it all came undone."
