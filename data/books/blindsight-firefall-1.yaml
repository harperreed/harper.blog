description: 'It''s been two months since a myriad of alien objects clenched about
  the Earth, screaming as they burned. The heavens have been silent since - until
  a derelict space probe hears whispers from a distant comet. Something talks out
  there: but not to us. Who to send to meet the alien, when the alien doesn''t want
  to meet? Send a linguist with multiple-personality disorder, and a biologist so
  spliced to machinery he can''t feel his own flesh. Send a pacifist warrior, and
  a vampire recalled from the grave by the voodoo of paleogenetics. Send a man with
  half his mind gone since childhood. Send them to the edge of the solar system, praying
  you can trust such freaks and monsters with the fate of a world. You fear they may
  be more alien than the thing they''ve been sent to find - but you''d give anything
  for that to be true, if you knew what was waiting for them.'
