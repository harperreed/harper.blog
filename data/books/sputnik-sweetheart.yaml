description: "Haruki Murakami, the internationally bestselling author of <i>Norwegian\
  \ Wood</i> and <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>, plunges us into an urbane Japan\
  \ of jazz bars, coffee shops, Jack Kerouac, and the Beatles to tell this story of\
  \ a tangled triangle of uniquely unrequited loves.<br /><br />A college student,\
  \ identified only as \u201CK,\u201D falls in love with his classmate, Sumire. But\
  \ devotion to an untidy writerly life precludes her from any personal commitments\u2013\
  until she meets Miu, an older and much more sophisticated businesswoman. When Sumire\
  \ disappears from an island off the coast of Greece, \u201CK\u201D is solicited\
  \ to join the search party and finds himself drawn back into her world and beset\
  \ by ominous, haunting visions. A love story combined with a detective story, <i>Sputnik\
  \ Sweetheart</i> ultimately lingers in the mind as a profound meditation on human\
  \ longing."
