description: "Humanity has been faithfully serving the Citizens for years, and Kirsten\
  \ Quinn-Kovacks is among the best and the brightest of the humans. She gratefully\
  \ serves the race that rescued her ancestors from a dying starship, gave them a\
  \ home world, and nurtures them still. If only the Citizens knew where Kirsten's\
  \ people came from.<br /><br />A chain reaction of supernovae at the galaxy's core\
  \ unleashes a wave of lethal radiation that will sterilize the galaxy. The Citizens\
  \ flee, taking their planets, the Fleet of Worlds, with them.<br /><br />Someone\
  \ must scout ahead, and Kirsten and her crew eagerly volunteer. Under the guiding\
  \ eye of Nessus, their Citizen mentor, they explore for any possible dangers in\
  \ the Fleet's path\u2014and uncover long-hidden truths that will shake the foundations\
  \ of worlds.<br /><i>Fleet of Worlds</i> marks Larry Niven's first novel-length\
  \ collaboration within his Known Space universe, the playground he created for his\
  \ bestselling Ringworld series. Teaming up with fellow SF writer Edward M. Lerner,\
  \ <i>Fleet of Worlds</i> takes a closer look at the Human-Puppeteer (Citizens) relations\
  \ and the events leading up to Niven's first Ringworld novel."
