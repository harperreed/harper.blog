description: Retired from his fighting days, John Perry is now village ombudsman for
  a human colony on distant Huckleberry. With his wife, former Special Forces warrior
  Jane Sagan, he farms several acres, adjudicates local disputes, and enjoys watching
  his adopted daughter grow up.<br /><br />That is, until his and Jane's past reaches
  out to bring them back into the game--as leaders of a new human colony, to be peopled
  by settlers from all the major human worlds, for a deep political purpose that will
  put Perry and Sagan back in the thick of interstellar politics, betrayal, and war.

      description: "<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author John Scalzi takes you\
        \ on an epic romp of galactic conquest and exploration in the Old Man's War\
        \ series. Humanity has reached the stars, but have been engaged in wars with\
        \ alien races for decades over habitable planets. The Colonial Defense Force\
        \ fights for Earth. To join the CDF, a recruit must have reached retirement\
        \ age. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge\
        \ and skills of decades of living. Soldiers are taken off Earth and never\
        \ allowed to return. They'll serve time at the front. And if they survive,\
        \ they'll be given a generous homestead on one of Earth's hard-won colony\
        \ planets.\n    \n    \n    Old Man\u2019s War, The Last Colony and Zoe\u2019\
        s Tale were each nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in their respective\
        \ years. Zoe\u2019s Tale was additionally nominated for the Andre Norton Award\
        \ for Best Young Adult Science Fiction/Fantasy. The Ghost Brigades was nominated\
        \ for the Prometheus Award. Old Man\u2019s War was the winner of the Geffen\
        \ Award in Israel; The Last Colony the recipient of the Seiun Award in Japan.\n\
        \    \n    Old Man\u2019s War was ranked #1 on the Tor.com reader poll of\
        \ the best science fiction and fantasy novels of 2000 \u2013 2010. It is listed\
        \ on the NPR.com reader poll of the Top 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy Books/Series."
