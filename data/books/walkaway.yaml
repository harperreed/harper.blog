description: "Cory Doctorow\u2019s first adult novel in eight years: an epic tale\
  \ of revolution, love, post-scarcity, and the end of death.<br /><br />Hubert Vernon\
  \ Rudolph Clayton Irving Wilson Alva Anton Jeff Harley Timothy Curtis Cleveland\
  \ Cecil Ollie Edmund Eli Wiley Marvin Ellis Espinoza\u2014known to his friends as\
  \ Hubert, Etc\u2014was too old to be at that Communist party.<br /><br />But after\
  \ watching the breakdown of modern society, he really has no where left to be\u2014\
  except amongst the dregs of disaffected youth who party all night and heap scorn\
  \ on the sheep they see on the morning commute. After falling in with Natalie, an\
  \ ultra-rich heiress trying to escape the clutches of her repressive father, the\
  \ two decide to give up fully on formal society\u2014and walk away.<br /><br />After\
  \ all, now that anyone can design and print the basic necessities of life\u2014\
  food, clothing, shelter\u2014from a computer, there seems to be little reason to\
  \ toil within the system.<br /><br />It\u2019s still a dangerous world out there,\
  \ the empty lands wrecked by climate change, dead cities hollowed out by industrial\
  \ flight, shadows hiding predators animal and human alike. Still, when the initial\
  \ pioneer walkaways flourish, more people join them. Then the walkaways discover\
  \ the one thing the ultra-rich have never been able to buy: how to beat death. Now\
  \ it\u2019s war \u2013 a war that will turn the world upside down.<br /><br />Fascinating,\
  \ moving, and darkly humorous, <i>Walkaway</i> is a multi-generation SF thriller\
  \ about the wrenching changes of the next hundred years\u2026and the very human\
  \ people who will live their consequences."
