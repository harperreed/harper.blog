description: <b>Ayn Rand</b> here sets forth the moral principles of Objectivism,
  the philosophy that holds human life--the life proper to a rational being--as the
  standard of moral values and regards altruism as incompatible with man's nature,
  with the creative requirements of his survival, and with a free society.<br /><br
