description: "<b>This cozy debut science fiction novel tells a story of misfits, rebels,\
  \ found family\u2014and a mystery that spans the stars.</b> <br /><br />Welcome\
  \ to the Grand Abeona Hotel: home of the finest food, the sweetest service, and\
  \ the very best views the galaxy has to offer. All year round it moves from planet\
  \ to planet, system to system, pampering guests across the furthest reaches of the\
  \ milky way. The last word in sub-orbital luxury\u2014and an absolute magnet for\
  \ intrigue. Intrigues such as: Why are there love poems in the lobby inbox? How\
  \ many Imperial spies are currently on board? What is the true purpose of the Problem\
  \ Solver's conference? And perhaps most pertinently\u2014<i>who is driving the ship?</i>\
  \ <br /><br />Each guest has a secret, every member of staff a universe unto themselves.\
  \ At the center of these interweaving lives and interlocking mysteries stands Carl,\
  \ one time stowaway, longtime manager, devoted caretaker to the hotel. It's the\
  \ love of his life and the only place he's ever called home. But as forces beyond\
  \ Carl's comprehension converge on the Abeona, he has to face one final question:\
  \ when is it time to let go?"
