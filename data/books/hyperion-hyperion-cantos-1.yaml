description: "On the world called Hyperion, beyond the law of the Hegemony of Man,\
  \ there waits the creature called the Shrike. There are those who worship it. There\
  \ are those who fear it. And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the\
  \ Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through\
  \ time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire\
  \ galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking\
  \ the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives. Each carries a desperate hope\u2014\
  and a terrible secret. And one may hold the fate of humanity in his hands. <br /><br\
  \ />A stunning tour de force filled with transcendent awe and wonder, <i>Hyperion</i>\
  \ is a masterwork of science fiction that resonates with excitement and invention,\
  \ the first volume in a remarkable new science fiction epic by the multiple-award-winning\
  \ author of <i>The Hollow Man</i>."
