description: 'High-rise public housing developments were signature features of the
  post-World War II city. A hopeful experiment in providing temporary, inexpensive
  housing for all Americans, the "projects" soon became synonymous with the black
  urban poor, with isolation and overcrowding, with drugs, gang violence, and neglect.
  As the wrecking ball brings down some of these concrete monoliths, Sudhir Venkatesh
  seeks to reexamine public housing from the inside out, and to salvage its troubled
  legacy. Based on nearly a decade of fieldwork in Chicago''s Robert Taylor Homes,
  <i>American Project</i> is the first comprehensive story of daily life in an American
  public housing complex.<br /><br />Venkatesh draws on his relationships with tenants,
  gang members, police officers, and local organizations to offer an intimate portrait
  of an inner-city community that journalists and the public have only viewed from
  a distance. Challenging the conventional notion of public housing as a failure,
  this startling book re-creates tenants'' thirty-year effort to build a safe and
  secure neighborhood: their political battles for services from an indifferent city
  bureaucracy, their daily confrontation with entrenched poverty, their painful decisions
  about whether to work with or against the street gangs whose drug dealing both sustained
  and imperiled their lives.<br /><br /><i>American Project</i> explores the fundamental
  question of what makes a community viable. In his chronicle of tenants'' political
  and personal struggles to create a decent place to live, Venkatesh brings us to
  the heart of the matter.'
