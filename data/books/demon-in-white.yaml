description: For almost a hundred years, Hadrian Marlowe has served the Empire in
  its war against the Cielcin, a vicious alien race bent on humanity's destruction.
  Rumors of a new king amongst the Cielcin have reached the Imperial throne. This
  one is not like the others. It does not raid borderworld territories, preferring
  precise, strategic attacks on the humans' Empire.<br /><br />To make matters worse,
  a cult of personality has formed around Hadrian, spurred on by legends of his having
  defied death itself. Men call him Halfmortal. Hadrian's rise to prominence proves
  dangerous to himself and his team, as pressures within the Imperial government distrust
  or resent his new influence.<br /><br />Caught in the middle, Hadrian must contend
  with enemies before him--and behind.<br /><br />And above it all, there is the mystery
  of the Quiet. Hadrian did defy death. He did return. But the keys to the only place
  in the universe where Hadrian might find the answers he seeks lie in the hands of
  the Emperor himself....
