description: "In this revelatory book, Sudhir Venkatesh takes us into Maquis Park,\
  \ a poor black neighborhood on Chicago\u2019s Southside, to explore the desperate,\
  \ dangerous, and remarkable ways in which a community survives. We find there an\
  \ entire world of unregulated, unreported, and untaxed work, a system of living\
  \ off the books that is daily life in the ghetto. From women who clean houses and\
  \ prepare lunches for the local hospital to small-scale entrepreneurs like the mechanic\
  \ who works in an alley; from the preacher who provides mediation services to the\
  \ salon owner who rents her store out for gambling parties; and from street vendors\
  \ hawking socks and incense to the drug dealing and extortion of the local gang,\
  \ we come to see how these activities form the backbone of the ghetto economy.<br\
  \ /><br />What emerges are the innumerable ways that these men and women, immersed\
  \ in their shadowy economic pursuits, are connected to and reliant upon one another.\
  \ The underground economy, as Venkatesh\u2019s subtle storytelling reveals, functions\
  \ as an intricate web, and in the strength of its strands lie the fates of many\
  \ Maquis Park residents. The result is a dramatic narrative of individuals at work,\
  \ and a rich portrait of a community. But while excavating the efforts of men and\
  \ women to generate a basic livelihood for themselves and their families, <em>Off\
  \ the Books</em> offers a devastating critique of the entrenched poverty that we\
  \ so often ignore in America, and reveals how the underground economy is an inevitable\
  \ response to the ghetto\u2019s appalling isolation from the rest of the country."
