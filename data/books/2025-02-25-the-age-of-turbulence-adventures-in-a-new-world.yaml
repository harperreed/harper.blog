description: "In the immediate aftermath of September 11, 2001, in his fourteenth\
  \ year as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan took part in a very\
  \ quiet collective effort to ensure that America didn't experience an economic meltdown,\
  \ taking the rest of the world with it. There was good reason to fear the worst:\
  \ the stock market crash of October 1987, his first major crisis as Federal Reserve\
  \ Chairman, coming just weeks after he assumed control, had come much closer than\
  \ is even today generally known to freezing the financial system and triggering\
  \ a genuine financial panic. But the most remarkable thing that happened to the\
  \ economy after 9/11 was...nothing. What in an earlier day would have meant a crippling\
  \ shock to the system was absorbed astonishingly quickly. <p> After 9/11 Alan Greenspan\
  \ knew, if he needed any further reinforcement, that we're living in a new world\
  \ - the world of a global capitalist economy that is vastly more flexible, resilient,\
  \ open, self-directing, and fast-changing than it was even 20 years ago. It's a\
  \ world that presents us with enormous new possibilities but also enormous new challenges.\
  \ <i>The Age of Turbulence</i> is Alan Greenspan's incomparable reckoning with the\
  \ nature of this new world - how we got here, what we're living through, and what\
  \ lies over the horizon, for good and for ill-channeled through his own experiences\
  \ working in the command room of the global economy for longer and with greater\
  \ effect than any other single living figure. He begins his account on that September\
  \ 11th morning, but then leaps back to his childhood, and follows the arc of his\
  \ remarkable life's journey through to his more than 18-year tenure as Chairman\
  \ of the Federal Reserve Board, from 1987 to 2006, during a time of transforming\
  \ change. </p><p> Alan Greenspan shares the story of his life first simply with\
  \ an eye toward doing justice to the extraordinary amount of history he has experienced\
  \ and shaped. But his other goal is to draw readers along the same learning curve\
  \ he followed, so they accrue a grasp of his own understanding of the underlying\
  \ dynamics that drive world events. In the second half of the book, having brought\
  \ us to the present and armed us with the conceptual tools to follow him forward,\
  \ Dr. Greenspan embarks on a magnificent tour de horizon of the global economy.\
  \ He reveals the universals of economic growth, delves into the specific facts on\
  \ the ground in each of the major countries and regions of the world, and explains\
  \ what the trend-lines of globalization are from here. The distillation of a life's\
  \ worth of wisdom and insight into an elegant expression of a coherent worldview,\
  \ <i>The Age of Turbulence</i> will stand as Alan Greenspan's personal and intellectual\
  \ legacy. <br /><br />A Timeline of a Remarkable Career<br /><br />Mar. 6, 1926:\
