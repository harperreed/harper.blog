description: "On the dyson sphere Shenzhen, artificial intelligences rule and humans\
  \ live in luxury, vying to be chosen as host bodies\u2014called haruspices\u2014\
  for the next generation of AI, and thus be worshiped as gods. <br /> <br />Doctor\
  \ Orfea Leung has come here to escape her past of mercenary violence. Krissana Khongtip\
  \ has come here to reinvent herself from haunted spy to holy cyborg. But the utopian\
  \ peace of Shenzhen is shattered when the haruspices begin committing suicide, and\
  \ the pair are called upon to solve the mystery\u2014and survive the silent war\
  \ between machines . . ."
