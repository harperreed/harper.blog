description: "<b>Mimi is a 'waste girl',</b> a member of the lowest caste on Silicon\
  \ Isle.<br /><br />Located off China's southeastern coast, Silicon Isle is the global\
  \ capital for electronic waste recycling, where thousands like Mimi toil day and\
  \ night, hoping one day they too will enjoy the wealth they\u2019ve created for\
  \ their employers, the three clans who have ruled the isle for generations.<br /><br\
  \ /><b>Luo Jincheng </b>is the head of one of these clans, a role passed down from\
  \ his father and grandfather before him. As the government enforces tighter restrictions,\
  \ Luo in turn tightens the reins on the waste workers in his employ. Ruthlessness\
  \ is his means of survival.<br /><br /><b>Scott Brandle</b> has come to Silicon\
  \ Isle representing TerraGreen Recycling, an American corporation that stands to\
  \ earn ungodly sums if they can reach a deal to modernize the island\u2019s recycling\
  \ process.<br /><br /><b>Chen Kaizong</b>, a Chinese American, travels to Silicon\
  \ Isle as Scott\u2019s interpreter. There, Kaizong is hoping to find his heritage,\
  \ but finds more questions instead. The home he longs for may not exist.<br /><br\
  \ /><b>As these forces collide, a dark futuristic virus is unleashed on the island,\
  \ and war erupts between the rich and the poor; between Chinese tradition and American\
  \ ambition; between humanity\u2019s past and its future.</b>"
