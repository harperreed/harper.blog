description: "It has a dark past \u2013 one in which a number of humans were killed.\
  \ A past that caused it to christen itself \u201CMurderbot\u201D. But it has only\
  \ vague memories of the massacre that spawned that title, and it wants to know more.<br\
  \ /><br />Teaming up with a Research Transport vessel named ART (you don\u2019t\
  \ want to know what the \u201CA\u201D stands for), Murderbot heads to the mining\
  \ facility where it went rogue.<br /><br />What it discovers will forever change\
  \ the way it thinks\u2026"
