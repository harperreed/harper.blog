description: "Cry, the Beloved Country, the most famous and important novel in South\
  \ Africa\u2019s history, was an immediate worldwide bestseller in 1948. Alan Paton\u2019\
  s impassioned novel about a black man\u2019s country under white man\u2019s law\
  \ is a work of searing beauty.<br /><br /><i>Cry, the beloved country, for the unborn\
  \ child that is the inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply.\
  \ Let him not laugh too gladly when the water runs through his fingers, nor stand\
  \ too silent when the setting sun makes red the veld with fire. Let him not be too\
  \ moved when the birds of his land are singing, nor give too much of his heart to\
  \ a mountain or valley. For fear will rob him of all if he gives too much.</i><br\
  \ /><br /><i></i>The eminent literary critic Lewis Gannett wrote, \u201CWe have\
  \ had many novels from statesmen and reformers, almost all bad; many novels from\
  \ poets, almost all thin. In Alan Paton\u2019s <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> the\
  \ statesman, the poet and the novelist meet in a unique harmony.\u201D <br /><br\
  \ /><i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> is the deeply moving story of the Zulu pastor\
  \ Stephen Kumalo and his son, Absalom, set against the background of a land and\
  \ a people riven by racial injustice. Remarkable for its lyricism, unforgettable\
  \ for character and incident, <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> is a classic work\
  \ of love and hope, courage and endurance, born of the dignity of man."
