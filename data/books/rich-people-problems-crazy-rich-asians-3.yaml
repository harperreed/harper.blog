description: "<b>Kevin Kwan, bestselling author of <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> and <i>China\
  \ Rich Girlfriend</i>, is back with an uproarious new novel of a family riven by\
  \ fortune, an ex-wife driven psychotic with jealousy, a battle royal fought through\
  \ couture gown sabotage, and the heir to one of Asia's greatest fortunes locked\
  \ out of his inheritance. </b><br /><br />When Nicholas Young hears that his grandmother,\
  \ Su Yi, is on her deathbed, he rushes to be by her bedside\u2014but he's not alone.\
  \ It seems the entire Shang-Young clan has convened from all corners of the globe,\
  \ ostensibly to care for their matriarch but truly to stake claim on the massive\
  \ fortune that Su Yi controls. With each family member secretly fantasizing about\
  \ getting the keys to Tyersall Park\u2014a trophy estate on 64 prime acres in the\
  \ heart of Singapore\u2014the place becomes a hotbed of intrigue and Nicholas finds\
  \ himself blocked from entering the premises. As relatives claw over heirlooms,\
  \ Astrid Leong is at the center of her own storm, desperately in love with her old\
  \ sweetheart Charlie Wu, but tormented by his ex-wife\u2014a woman hell bent on\
  \ destroying Astrid's reputation and relationship. Meanwhile Kitty Pong, married\
  \ to billionaire Jack Bing, finds a formidable opponent in his fashionista daughter,\
  \ Colette. A sweeping novel that takes us from the elegantly appointed mansions\
  \ of Manila to the secluded private islands in the Sulu Sea, from a schoolyard kidnapping\
  \ to a gold-leaf dancefloor spattered with blood, Kevin Kwan's gloriously wicked\
  \ new novel reveals the long-buried secrets and rich people problems of Asia's most\
  \ privileged families."
