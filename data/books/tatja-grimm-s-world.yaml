description: Multiple Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge's first full-length novel<br
  /><br />As a mud-spattered youngster, Tatja quickly realized she was different from
  the stone-age primitives with whom she grew up. Her insatiable curiosity and thirst
  for knowledge could not be quenched among them; she had to explore and learn more
  about the strange world she lived on.<br /><br />She finds the bastion of all culture,
  arts, entertainment and history for the entire planet, the seven-hundred-year-old
  science fiction magazine <i>Fantasie</i>, which is produced entirely aboard a gargantuan
  floating vessel the size of a small city. But despite the printing presses, sail-powered
  vessels, and mind-expanding technology, Tatja is still dissatisfied. Rising through
  the ranks, she finds that the people on the enormous barge are just as unintelligent
  as the primitives she grew up with. But others have come to the planet who not only
  challenge her intelligence, but offer her a tantalizing opportunity to uncover answers
  to mysteries that have long plagued her.<br /><br />But with opportunity comes risk.
  And if she acts unwisely, she could bring doom to the only world she knows.
