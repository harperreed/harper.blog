description: "<b>WATER IS POWER</b><br /> \_<br /> Paolo Bacigalupi,\_<i>New York\
  \ Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Windup Girl</i> and National Book Award\
  \ finalist, delivers a near-future thriller that casts new light on how we live\
  \ today\u2014and what may be in store for us tomorrow.<br /><br /> The American\
  \ Southwest has been decimated by drought. Nevada and Arizona skirmish over dwindling\
  \ shares of the Colorado River, while California watches, deciding if it should\
  \ just take the whole river all for itself. Into the fray steps Las Vegas water\
  \ knife Angel Velasquez. Detective, assassin, and spy, Angel \u201Ccuts\u201D water\
  \ for the Southern Nevada Water Authority and its boss, Catherine Case, ensuring\
  \ that her lush, luxurious arcology developments can bloom in the desert and that\
  \ anyone who challenges her is left in the gutted-suburban dust.<br /><br /> When\
  \ rumors of a game-changing water source surface in Phoenix, Angel is sent to investigate.\
  \ With a wallet full of identities and a tricked-out Tesla, Angel arrows south,\
  \ hunting for answers that seem to evaporate as the heat index soars and the landscape\
  \ becomes more and more oppressive. There, Angel encounters Lucy Monroe, a hardened\
  \ journalist, who knows far more about Phoenix\u2019s water secrets than she admits,\
  \ and Maria Villarosa, a young Texas migrant, who dreams of escaping north to those\
  \ places where water still falls from the sky.<br /><br /> As bodies begin to pile\
  \ up and bullets start flying, the three find themselves pawns in a game far bigger,\
  \ more corrupt, and dirtier than any of them could have imagined. With Phoenix teetering\
  \ on the verge of collapse and time running out for Angel, Lucy, and Maria, their\
  \ only hope for survival rests in one another\u2019s hands. \_But when water is\
  \ more valuable than gold, alliances shift like sand, and the only truth in the\
  \ desert is that someone will have to bleed if anyone hopes to drink.<br /><br /><br\
