description: "<b>The celebrated author of <i>A Spy Among Friends</i> and <i>Rogue\
  \ Heroes</i> returns with his greatest spy story yet, a thrilling Cold War-era tale\
  \ of Oleg Gordievsky, the Russian whose secret work helped hasten the collapse of\
  \ the Soviet Union.</b><br /><br />If anyone could be considered a Russian counterpart\
  \ to the infamous British double-agent Kim Philby, it was Oleg Gordievsky. The son\
  \ of two KGB agents and the product of the best Soviet institutions, the savvy,\
  \ sophisticated Gordievsky grew to see his nation's communism as both criminal and\
  \ philistine. He took his first posting for Russian intelligence in 1968 and eventually\
  \ became the Soviet Union's top man in London, but from 1973 on he was secretly\
  \ working for MI6. <br /><br />For nearly a decade, as the Cold War reached its\
  \ twilight, Gordievsky helped the West turn the tables on the KGB, exposing Russian\
  \ spies and helping to foil countless intelligence plots, as the Soviet leadership\
  \ grew increasingly paranoid at the United States's nuclear first-strike capabilities\
  \ and brought the world closer to the brink of war. Desperate to keep the circle\
  \ of trust close, MI6 never revealed Gordievsky's name to its counterparts in the\
  \ CIA, which in turn grew obsessed with figuring out the identity of Britain's obviously\
  \ top-level source. Their obsession ultimately doomed Gordievsky: the CIA officer\
  \ assigned to identify him was none other than Aldrich Ames, the man who would become\
  \ infamous for secretly spying for the Soviets. <br /> <br />Unfolding the delicious\
  \ three-way gamesmanship between America, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and culminating\
  \ in the gripping cinematic beat-by-beat of Gordievsky's nail-biting escape from\
  \ Moscow in 1985, Ben Macintyre's latest may be his best yet. Like the greatest\
  \ novels of John le Carr\xE9, it brings readers deep into a world of treachery and\
  \ betrayal, where the lines bleed between the personal and the professional, and\
  \ one man's hatred of communism had the power to change the future of nations."
