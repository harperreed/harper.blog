description: "Arkady Martine, the acclaimed author of the Teixcalaan Series, returns\
  \ with an astonishing new novella.<br /><br />Basit Deniau\u2019s houses were haunted\
  \ to begin with.<br /><br />A house embedded with an artificial intelligence is\
  \ a common thing: a house that is an artificial intelligence, infused in every load-bearing\
  \ beam and fine marble tile with a thinking creature that is not human? That is\
  \ something else altogether. But now Deniau\u2019s been dead a year, and Rose House\
  \ is locked up tight, as commanded by the architect\u2019s will: all his possessions\
  \ and files and sketches are confined in its archives, and their only keeper is\
  \ Rose House itself. Rose House, and one other.<br /><br />Dr. Selene Gisil, one\
  \ of Deniau\u2019s former prot\xE9g\xE9, is permitted to come into Rose House once\
  \ a year. She alone may open Rose House\u2019s vaults, look at drawings and art,\
  \ talk with Rose House\u2019s animating intelligence all she likes. Until this week,\
  \ Dr. Gisil was the only person whom Rose House spoke to.<br /><br />But even an\
  \ animate intelligence that haunts a house has some failsafes common to all AIs.\
  \ For instance: all AIs must report the presence of a dead body to the nearest law\
  \ enforcement agency.<br /><br />There is a dead person in Rose House. The house\
  \ says so. It is not Basit Deniau, and it is not Dr. Gisil. It is someone else.\
  \ Rose House, having completed its duty of care and informed Detective Maritza Smith\
  \ of the China Lake police precinct that there is in fact a dead person inside it,\
  \ dead of unnatural causes\u2014has shut up.<br /><br />No one can get inside Rose\
  \ House, except Dr. Gisil. Dr. Gisil was not in North America when Rose House called\
  \ the China Lake precinct. But someone did. And someone died there. And someone\
  \ may be there still."
