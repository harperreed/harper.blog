description: "A work-from-home comedy where WFH meets WTF.<br /><br />Told entirely\
  \ through clever and captivating Slack messages, this irresistible, relatable satire\
  \ of both virtual work and contemporary life is <i>The Office</i> for a new world.<br\
  \ /><br />Gerald, a mid-level employee of a New York\u2013based public relations\
  \ firm has been uploaded into the company\u2019s internal Slack channels\u2014at\
  \ least his consciousness has. His colleagues assume it\u2019s an elaborate gag\
  \ to exploit the new work-from home policy, but now that Gerald\u2019s productivity\
  \ is through the roof, his bosses are only too happy to let him work from . . .\
  \ wherever he says he is.<br /> <br />Faced with the looming abyss of a disembodied\
  \ life online, Gerald enlists his co-worker Pradeep to help him escape, and to find\
  \ out what happened to his body. But the longer Gerald stays in the void, the more\
  \ alluring and absurd his reality becomes.<br /> <br />Meanwhile, Gerald\u2019s\
  \ colleagues have PR catastrophes of their own to handle in the real world. Their\
  \ biggest client, a high-end dog food company, is in the midst of recalling a bad\
  \ batch of food that\u2019s allegedly poisoning Pomeranians nationwide. And their\
  \ CEO suspects someone is sabotaging his office furniture. And if Gerald gets to\
  \ work from home all the time, why can\u2019t everyone? Is true love possible between\
  \ two people, when one is just a line of text in an app? And what in the hell does\
  \ the :dusty-stick: emoji mean?<br /> <br />In a time when office paranoia and politics\
  \ have followed us home, Calvin Kasulke is here to capture the surprising, absurd,\
  \ and fully-relatable factors attacking our collective sanity\u2026and give us hope\
  \ that we can still find a human connection."
