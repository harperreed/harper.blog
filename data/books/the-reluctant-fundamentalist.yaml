description: "At a caf\xE9 table in Lahore, a bearded Pakistani man converses with\
  \ an uneasy American stranger. As dusk deepens to night, he begins the tale that\
  \ has brought them to this fateful encounter\u2026<br /><br />Changez is living\
  \ an immigrant's dream of America. At the top of his class at Princeton, he is snapped\
  \ up by an elite valuation firm. He thrives on the energy of New York, and his budding\
  \ romance with elegant, beautiful Erica promises entry into Manhattan society at\
  \ the same exalted level once occupied by his own family back in Lahore.<br /><br\
  \ />But in the wake of September 11, Changez finds his position in his adopted city\
  \ suddenly overturned, and his relationship with Erica shifting. And Changez's own\
  \ identity is in seismic shift as well, unearthing allegiances more fundamental\
  \ than money, power, and maybe even love. <br /><br />\"Extreme times call for extreme\
  \ reactions, extreme writing. Hamid has done something extraordinary with this novel.\"\
  \ \u2014Washington Post<br /><br />\"One of those achingly assured novels that makes\
  \ you happy to be a reader.\" \u2014Junot Diaz <br /><br />\"Brief, charming, and\
  \ quietly furious . . . a resounding success.\" \u2014Village Voice <br /><br />A\
  \ Washington Post and San Francisco Chronicle Best Book of the Year <br />A New\
  \ York Times Notable Book"
