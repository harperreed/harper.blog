description: "<b>A sweeping, in-depth history of NSA, whose famous \u201Ccult of silence\u201D\
  \ has left the agency shrouded in mystery for decades </b><br /> \_<br /> The National\
  \ Security Agency was born out of the legendary codebreaking programs of World War\
  \ II that cracked the famed Enigma machine and other German and Japanese codes,\
  \ thereby turning the tide of Allied victory. In the postwar years, as the United\
  \ States developed a new enemy in the Soviet Union, our intelligence community found\
  \ itself targeting not soldiers on the battlefield, but suspected spies, foreign\
  \ leaders, and even American citizens. Throughout the second half of the twentieth\
  \ century, NSA played a vital, often fraught and controversial role in the major\
  \ events of the Cold War, from the Korean War to the Cuban Missile Crisis to Vietnam\
  \ and beyond. <br /><br />In <i>Code Warriors,</i> Stephen Budiansky\u2014a longtime\
  \ expert in cryptology\u2014tells the fascinating story of how NSA came to be, from\
  \ its roots in World War II through the fall of the Berlin Wall. Along the way,\
  \ he guides us through the fascinating challenges faced by cryptanalysts, and how\
  \ they broke some of the most complicated codes of the twentieth century. With access\
  \ to new documents, Budiansky shows where the agency succeeded and failed during\
  \ the Cold War, but his account also offers crucial perspective for assessing NSA\
  \ today in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations. Budiansky shows how NSA\u2019\
  s obsession with recording every bit of data and decoding every signal is far from\
  \ a new development; throughout its history the depth and breadth of the agency\u2019\
  s reach has resulted in both remarkable successes and destructive failures. <br\
  \ /><br />Featuring a series of appendixes that explain the technical details of\
  \ Soviet codes and how they were broken, this is a rich and riveting history of\
