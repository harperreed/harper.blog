description: Enoch Wallace is an ageless hermit, striding across his untended farm
  as he has done for over a century, still carrying the gun with which he had served
  in the Civil War. But what his neighbors must never know is that, inside his unchanging
  house, he meets with a host of unimaginable friends from the farthest stars.<br
  /><br />More than a hundred years before, an alien named Ulysses had recruited Enoch
  as the keeper of Earth's only galactic transfer station. Now, as Enoch studies the
  progress of Earth and tends the tanks where the aliens appear, the charts he made
  indicate his world is doomed to destruction. His alien friends can only offer help
  that seems worse than the dreaded disaster. Then he discovers the horror that lies
  across the galaxy...
