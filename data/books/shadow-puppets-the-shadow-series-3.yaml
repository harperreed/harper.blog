description: Bestselling author Orson Scott Card brings to life a new chapter in the
  saga of Ender's Earth.<br /><br />Earth and its society have been changed irrevocably
  in the aftermath of Ender Wiggin's victory over the Formics. The unity forced upon
  the warring nations by an alien enemy has shattered. Nations are rising again, seeking
  territory and influence, and most of all, seeking to control the skills and loyalty
  of the children from the Battle School.<br /><br />But one person has a better idea.
  Peter Wiggin, Ender's older, more ruthless, brother, sees that any hope for the
  future of Earth lies in restoring a sense of unity and purpose. And he has an irresistible
  call on the loyalty of Earth's young warriors. With Bean at his side, the two will
  reshape our future.<br /><br />Here is the continuing story of Bean and Petra, and
  the rest of Ender's Dragon Army, as they take their places in the new government
  of Earth.
