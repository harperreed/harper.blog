description: 'In December 1937, the Japanese army invaded the ancient city of Nanking,
  systematically raping, torturing, and murdering more than 300,000 Chinese civilians.
  <br /><br />This book tells the story from three perspectives: of the Japanese soldiers
  who performed it, of the Chinese civilians who endured it, and of a group of Europeans
  and Americans who refused to abandon the city and were able to create a safety zone
  that saved many.'
