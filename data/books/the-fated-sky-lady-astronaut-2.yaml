description: "Of course the noted Lady Astronaut Elma York would like to go, but there\u2019\
  s a lot riding on whoever the International Aerospace Coalition decides to send\
  \ on this historic\u2014but potentially very dangerous\u2014mission? Could Elma\
  \ really leave behind her husband and the chance to start a family to spend several\
  \ years traveling to Mars? And with the Civil Rights movement taking hold all over\
  \ Earth, will the astronaut pool ever be allowed to catch up, and will these brave\
  \ men and women of all races be treated equitably when they get there? This gripping\
  \ look at the real conflicts behind a fantastical space race will put a new spin\
  \ on our visions of what might have been."
