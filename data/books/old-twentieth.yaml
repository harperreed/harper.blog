description: "The twentieth century lies hundreds of years in humanity\u2019s past.\
  \ But the near-immortal citizens of the future yearn for the good old days\u2014\
  when people\u2019s bodies were susceptible to death through disease and old age.\
  \ Now, they immerse themselves in virtual reality time machines to explore the life-to-death\
  \ arc that defined existence so long ago.\_Jacob Brewer is a virtual reality engineer,\
  \ overseeing the time machine\u2019s operation aboard the starship Aspera. But on\
  \ the thousand-year voyage to Beta Hydrii, the eight-hundred member crew gets more\
  \ reality than they expect when people entering the machine start to die."
