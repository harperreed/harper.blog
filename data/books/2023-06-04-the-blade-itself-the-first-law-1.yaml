description: <b>The first novel in the First Law Trilogy and debut novel from <i>New
  York Times</i> bestseller, Joe Abercrombie.</b><br /><br />Logen Ninefingers, infamous
  barbarian, has finally run out of luck. Caught in one feud too many, he's on the
  verge of becoming a dead barbarian -- leaving nothing behind him but bad songs,
  dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies. <br /><br />Nobleman, dashing officer,
  and paragon of selfishness, Captain Jezal dan Luthar has nothing more dangerous
  in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing
  circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight
  by altogether bloodier rules. <br /><br />Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer,
  would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta
  hates cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room
  for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart
  of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it. <br /><br />Enter
  the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant,
  he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever
  he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more
  difficult. <br /><br />Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are
  ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw
  blood<br /><br /><b>Unpredictable, compelling, wickedly funny, and packed with unforgettable
  characters, <i>The Blade Itself</i> is noir fantasy with a real cutting edge.</b><br
  /><br /><b>First Law Trilogy</b><br /><i>The Blade Itself</i><br /><i>Before They
