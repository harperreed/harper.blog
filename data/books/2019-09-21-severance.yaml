description: "<b>Maybe it\u2019s the end of the world, but not for Candace Chen, a\
  \ millennial, first-generation American and office drone meandering her way into\
  \ adulthood in Ling Ma\u2019s offbeat, wryly funny, apocalyptic satire, <i>Severance</i>.</b><br\
  \ /><br />Candace Chen, a millennial drone self-sequestered in a Manhattan office\
  \ tower, is devoted to routine. With the recent passing of her Chinese immigrant\
  \ parents, she\u2019s had her fill of uncertainty. She\u2019s content just to carry\
  \ on: She goes to work, troubleshoots the teen-targeted Gemstone Bible, watches\
  \ movies in a Greenpoint basement with her boyfriend.<br /><br />So Candace barely\
  \ notices when a plague of biblical proportions sweeps New York. Then Shen Fever\
  \ spreads. Families flee. Companies cease operations. The subways screech to a halt.\
  \ Her bosses enlist her as part of a dwindling skeleton crew with a big end-date\
  \ payoff. Soon entirely alone, still unfevered, she photographs the eerie, abandoned\
  \ city as the anonymous blogger NY Ghost.<br /><br />Candace won\u2019t be able\
  \ to make it on her own forever, though. Enter a group of survivors, led by the\
  \ power-hungry IT tech Bob. They\u2019re traveling to a place called the Facility,\
  \ where, Bob promises, they will have everything they need to start society anew.\
  \ But Candace is carrying a secret she knows Bob will exploit. Should she escape\
  \ from her rescuers?<br /><br />A send-up and takedown of the rituals, routines,\
  \ and missed opportunities of contemporary life, Ling Ma\u2019s <i>Severance </i>is\
  \ a moving family story, a quirky coming-of-adulthood tale, and a hilarious, deadpan\
  \ satire. Most important, it\u2019s a heartfelt tribute to the connections that\
  \ drive us to do more than survive."
