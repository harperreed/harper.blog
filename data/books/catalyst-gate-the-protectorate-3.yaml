description: In the final book of this explosive Philip K. Dick Award-nominated space
  opera, the universe is under threat and an ancient alien intelligence threatens
  to bring humanity down - unless Major Sanda Greeve and her crew can stop it . .
  .<br /><br />The code has been cracked. The secrets of the Casimir gates have been
  revealed. But humanity still isn't safe. The alien intelligence known as Rainier
  and her clones are still out there, hell-bent on its destruction. And only Sanda
  can stop them.<br /><br />With the universe's most powerful ship under her command
  and some of the most skilled hackers, fighters and spies on her team, it will still
  take everything she has to find the key to taking down an immortal enemy with seemingly
  limitless bodies, resources and power.
