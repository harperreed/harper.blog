description: "Ben Gold lives in dangerous times. Two generations ago, a virulent disease\
  \ turned the population of most of North America into little more than beasts called\
  \ Ferals. Some of those who survived took to the air, scratching out a living on\
  \ airships and dirigibles soaring over the dangerous ground.\_<br /><br />Ben has\
  \ his own airship, a family heirloom, and has signed up to help a group of scientists\
  \ looking for a cure. But that's not as easy as it sounds, especially with a power-hungry\
  \ air city looking to raid any nearby settlements. To make matters worse, his airship,\
  \ the only home he's ever known, is stolen. Ben must try to survive on the ground\
  \ while trying to get his ship back.\_\_<br /><br />This brings him to Gastown,\
  \ a city in the air recently conquered by belligerent and expansionist pirates.\
  \ When events turn deadly, Ben must decide what really matters--whether to risk\
  \ it all on a desperate chance for a better future or to truly remain on his own."
