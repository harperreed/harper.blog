description: "Acclaimed author Emma Newman returns to the captivating universe she\
  \ created in Planetfall with a stunning science fiction mystery where one man\u2019\
  s murder is much more than it seems...<br /><br />Govcorp detective Carlos Moreno\
  \ was only a baby when Atlas left Earth to seek truth among the stars. But in that\
  \ moment, the course of Carlos\u2019s entire life changed. Atlas is what took his\
  \ mother away; what made his father lose hope; what led Alejandro Casales, leader\
  \ of the religious cult known as the Circle, to his door. And now, on the eve of\
  \ the fortieth anniversary of Atlas\u2019s departure, it\u2019s got something to\
  \ do why Casales was found dead in his hotel room\u2014and why Carlos is the man\
  \ in charge of the investigation.<br /><br />To figure out who killed one of the\
  \ most powerful men on Earth, Carlos is supposed to put aside his personal history.\
  \ But the deeper he delves into the case, the more he realizes that escaping the\
  \ past is not so easy. There\u2019s more to Casales\u2019s death than meets the\
  \ eye, and something much more sinister to the legacy of Atlas than anyone realizes..."
