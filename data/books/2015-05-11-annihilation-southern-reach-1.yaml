      description: "Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades,\
        \ explored only in a series of expeditions dispatched by a secret government\
        \ agency called the Southern Reach. So far these expeditions have returned\
        \ -- when they have returned -- with more questions than answers.\n    \n\
        \    At the beginning of the Southern Reach series, we join the twelfth expedition.\
        \ What unfolds in <i>Annihilation</i>, <i>Authority</i>, and <i>Acceptance</i>\
        \ is an exhilarating, disturbing, and all but unbearably suspenseful story\
        \ of humanity engaged in what might be an existential confrontation with nature.\
        \ The series is destined to become a classic of its kind.\n    \n    <i>Annihilation</i>\
        \ was the basis for the Paramount Pictures film of the same name starring\
        \ Natalie Portman.\n    \n    http://us.macmillan.com/series/TheSouthernReachSeries\n\
        \    \n    Also known as:\n    <i>Trilogia dell'Area X</i>\n    <i>Trilogia\
