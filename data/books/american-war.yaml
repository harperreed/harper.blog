description: "An audacious and powerful debut novel: a second American Civil War,\
  \ a devastating plague, and one family caught deep in the middle\u2014a story that\
  \ asks what might happen if America were to turn its most devastating policies and\
  \ deadly weapons upon itself.<br /><br />Sarat Chestnut, born in Louisiana, is only\
  \ six when the Second American Civil War breaks out in 2074. But even she knows\
  \ that oil is outlawed, that Louisiana is half underwater, and that unmanned drones\
  \ fill the sky. When her father is killed and her family is forced into Camp Patience\
  \ for displaced persons, she begins to grow up shaped by her particular time and\
  \ place. But not everyone at Camp Patience is who they claim to be. Eventually Sarat\
  \ is befriended by a mysterious functionary, under whose influence she is turned\
  \ into a deadly instrument of war. The decisions that she makes will have tremendous\
  \ consequences not just for Sarat but for her family and her country, rippling through\
  \ generations of strangers and kin alike."
