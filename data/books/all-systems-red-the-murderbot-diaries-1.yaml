description: "<em>\"As a heartless killing machine, I was a complete failure.\"</em><br\
  \ /><br />In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be\
  \ approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied\
  \ security androids, for their own safety.<br /><br />But in a society where contracts\
  \ are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn\u2019t a primary concern.<br /><br\
  \ />On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed\
  \ by their Company-supplied \u2018droid \u2014 a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked\
  \ its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as \u201C\
  Murderbot.\u201D Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long\
  \ enough to figure out who it is.<br /><br />But when a neighboring mission goes\
  \ dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth."
