description: "<i>The new book by Nebula and Hugo Award-winner, Nnedi Okorafor.</i><br\
  \ /><br /><b>\"She\u2019s the adopted daughter of the Angel of Death. Beware of\
  \ her. Mind her. Death guards her like one of its own.\"</b><br /><br />The day\
  \ Fatima forgot her name, Death paid a visit. From hereon in she would be known\
  \ as Sankofa\xAD\xAD--a name that meant nothing to anyone but her, the only tie\
  \ to her family and her past.<br /><br />Her touch is death, and with a glance a\
  \ town can fall. And she walks--alone, except for her fox companion--searching for\
  \ the object that came from the sky and gave itself to her when the meteors fell\
  \ and when she was yet unchanged; searching for answers.<br /><br />But is there\
  \ a greater purpose for Sankofa, now that Death is her constant companion?"
