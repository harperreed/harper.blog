description: "<b>When an Earth-like planet is discovered, a team of six teens, along\
  \ with three veteran astronauts, embark on a twenty-year trip to set up a planet\
  \ for human colonization\u2014but find that space is more deadly than they ever\
  \ could have imagined. </b><br /><br /><i>Have you ever hoped you could leave everything\
  \ behind?<br /> Have you ever dreamt of a better world?<br /> Can a dream sustain\
  \ a lifetime?</i><br /> <br />A century ago, an astronomer discovered an Earth-like\
  \ planet orbiting a nearby star. She predicted that one day humans would travel\
  \ there to build a utopia. Today, ten astronauts are leaving everything behind to\
  \ find it. Four are veterans of the twentieth century\u2019s space-race.<br /> <br\
  \ />And six are teenagers who\u2019ve trained for this mission most of their lives.<br\
  \ /> <br />It will take the team twenty-three years to reach Terra-Two. Twenty-three\
  \ years locked in close quarters. Twenty-three years with no one to rely on but\
  \ each other. Twenty-three years with no rescue possible, should something go wrong.<br\
  \ /> <br />And something always goes wrong."
