description: <b>The Lost Fleet continues its perilous journey home.</b> <br /><br
  /> Badly damaged and low on supplies, the Alliance Fleet is raiding Syndic mines
  for raw materials-and Captain "Black Jack" Geary hopes they can continue to remain
  one step ahead of their enemies. But the Syndics are the least of Geary's worries
  when he learns of the existence of aliens with the power to annihilate the human
  race.
