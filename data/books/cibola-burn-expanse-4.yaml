description: "<b>The fourth novel in James S.A. Corey\u2019s New York Times bestselling\
  \ Expanse series</b><br /><br />The gates have opened the way to thousands of habitable\
  \ planets, and the land rush has begun. Settlers stream out from humanity's home\
  \ planets in a vast, poorly controlled flood, landing on a new world. Among them,\
  \ the Rocinante, haunted by the vast, posthuman network of the protomolecule as\
  \ they investigate what destroyed the great intergalactic society that built the\
  \ gates and the protomolecule.<br /><br />But Holden and his crew must also contend\
  \ with the growing tensions between the settlers and the company which owns the\
  \ official claim to the planet. Both sides will stop at nothing to defend what's\
  \ theirs, but soon a terrible disease strikes and only Holden - with help from the\
  \ ghostly Detective Miller - can find the cure."
