description: The novel is set during World War II, from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows
  the life of Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier. Most
  of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th Squadron is based on the
  island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea, west of Italy. The novel looks into
  the experiences of Yossarian and the other airmen in the camp, who attempt to maintain
  their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return
  home.
