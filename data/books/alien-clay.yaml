description: "They travelled into the unknown and left themselves behind . . .<br\
  \ /><br />On the distant world of Kiln lie the ruins of an alien civilization. It\u2019\
  s the greatest discovery in humanity\u2019s spacefaring history \u2013 yet who were\
  \ its builders and where did they go?<br /><br />Professor Arton Daghdev had always\
  \ wanted to study alien life up close. Then his wishes become a reality in the worst\
  \ way. His political activism sees him exiled from Earth to Kiln\u2019s extrasolar\
  \ labour camp. There, he\u2019s condemned to work under an alien sky until he dies.<br\
  \ /><br />Kiln boasts a ravenous, chaotic ecosystem like nothing seen on Earth.\
  \ The monstrous alien life interacts in surprising, sometimes shocking ways with\
  \ the human body, so Arton will risk death on a daily basis. However, the camp\u2019\
  s oppressive regime might just kill him first. If Arton can somehow escape both\
  \ fates, the world of Kiln holds a wondrous, terrible secret. It will redefine life\
  \ and intelligence as he knows it, and might just set him free . . ."
