description: It is winter in Area X, the mysterious wilderness that has defied explanation
  for thirty years, rebuffing expedition after expedition, refusing to reveal its
  secrets. As Area X expands, the agency tasked with investigating and overseeing
  it--the Southern Reach--has collapsed on itself in confusion. Now one last, desperate
  team crosses the border, determined to reach a remote island that may hold the answers
  they've been seeking. If they fail, the outer world is in peril.<br /><br />Meanwhile,
  Acceptance tunnels ever deeper into the circumstances surrounding the creation of
  Area X--what initiated this unnatural upheaval? Among the many who have tried, who
  has gotten close to understanding Area X--and who may have been corrupted by it?<br
  /><br />In this last installment of Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy, the
  mysteries of Area X may be solved, but their consequences and implications are no
  less profound--or terrifying.
