        make #4.5 the spot for it. I think the #3.5 ordering is based on the time
        period of the main events of the novella, rather than the time period of the
        last events of the novella. However, I''m leaving it at #5.5 for now, since
        the chronology is unclear and reading it before Nemesis Games is a terrible
