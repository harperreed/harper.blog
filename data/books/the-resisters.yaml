  \ from the always inventive and exciting author of <i>The Love Wife</i> and <i>Who's\
  \ Irish</i></b><br /><br />The time: a not-so-distant future. The place: AutoAmerica.\
  \ The land: half under water. The Internet\u2014the new face of government\u2014\
  is \"Aunt Nettie\": a mix of artificial intelligence, surveillance technology, and\
  \ pesky maxims. The people have been divided, and no one is happy. The angel-fair\
  \ \"Netted\" still have jobs and literally occupy the high ground, while the mostly\
  \ coppertoned \"Surplus\" live on swampland if they're lucky, on the water if they're\
  \ not. <br />\_\_\_\_ The story: To a Surplus couple\u2014he <i>was</i> a professor,\
  \ she's still a lawyer\u2014is born a Blasian girl with a golden arm. At two, Gwen\
  \ is hurling her stuffed animals from the crib; by ten she can hit whatever target\
  \ she likes with a baseball; her teens find her playing happily in an underground\
  \ Surplus league. When AutoAmerica re-enters the Olympics\u2014with a special eye\
  \ on beating ChinRussia\u2014Gwen attracts interest. Soon she's at Net U, falling\
  \ in love with her coach and considering \"crossing over,\" even as her mother is\
  \ challenging the AutoAmerican Way with lawsuits that will prove very dangerous.<br\
  \ />\_\_\_\_ An astonishing story of an America that seems only too possible, and\
  \ of a family struggling to maintain its humanity in circumstances that threaten\
  \ their every value\u2014even their very existence."
