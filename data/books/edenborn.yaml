description: In the wake of the microbial plague that decimated the world, the bioengineered
  children of <i>Idlewild</i> have spent the last eighteen years raising the next
  generation to inherit the Earth-a generation both human and post-human, divided
  into factions by the genetics used to create them. But as the factions clash over
  the future of humanity, an even deadlier contagion rises from the ashes of the original
  virus.
