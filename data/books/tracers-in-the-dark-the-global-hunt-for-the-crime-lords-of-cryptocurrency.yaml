description: "Over the last decade, a single innovation has massively fueled digital\
  \ black markets: cryptocurrency. Crime lords inhabiting lawless corners of the internet\
  \ have operated more freely\u2014whether in drug dealing, money laundering, or human\
  \ trafficking\u2014than their analog counterparts could have ever dreamed of. By\
  \ transacting not in dollars or pounds but in currencies with anonymous ledgers,\
  \ overseen by no government and beholden to no bankers, these black marketeers have\
  \ sought to rob law enforcement of their chief method of cracking down on illicit\
  \ finance: following the money.<br /><br />But what if the centerpiece of this dark\
  \ economy held a secret, fatal flaw? What if their currency wasn\u2019t so cryptic\
  \ after all? An investigator using the right mixture of technical wizardry, financial\
  \ forensics, and old-fashioned persistence could uncover an entire world of wrongdoing.<br\
  \ /><br /><i>Tracers in the Dark</i> is a story of crime and pursuit unlike any\
  \ other. With unprecedented access to the major players in federal law enforcement\
  \ and private industry, veteran cybersecurity reporter Andy Greenberg tells an astonishing\
  \ saga of criminal empires built and destroyed. He introduces an IRS agent with\
  \ a defiant streak, a bitcoin-tracing Danish entrepreneur, and a colorful ensemble\
  \ of hard-boiled agents and prosecutors as they delve deep into the crypto-underworld.\
  \ The result is a thrilling, globe-spanning story of dirty cops, drug bazaars, trafficking\
  \ rings, and the biggest take-down of an online narcotics market in the history\
  \ of the internet.<br /><br />Utterly of our time, <i>Tracers in the Dark</i> is\
  \ a cat-and-mouse story and a tale of a technological one-upmanship. Filled with\
  \ canny maneuvering and shocking twists, it answers a provocative question: How\
  \ would some of the world\u2019s most brazen criminals behave if they were sure\
  \ they could never get caught?"
