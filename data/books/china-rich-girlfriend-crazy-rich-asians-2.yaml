description: '<b>Kevin Kwan, bestselling author of <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, is back
  with a wickedly funny new novel of social climbing, secret e-mails, art-world scandal,
  lovesick billionaires, and the outrageous story of what happens when Rachel Chu,
  engaged to marry Asia''s most eligible bachelor, discovers her birth father.<br
  /></b> <br />On the eve of her wedding to Nicholas Young, heir to one of the greatest
  fortunes in Asia, Rachel should be over the moon. She has a flawless Asscher-cut
  diamond from JAR, a wedding dress she loves more than anything found in the salons
  of Paris, and a fiance willing to sacrifice his entire inheritance in order to marry
  her. But Rachel still mourns the fact that her birth father, a man she never knew,
  won''t be able to walk her down the aisle. Until: a shocking revelation draws Rachel
  into a world of Shanghai splendor beyond anything she has ever imagined. Here we
  meet Carlton, a Ferrari-crashing bad boy known for Prince Harry-like antics; Colette,
  a celebrity girlfriend chased by fevered paparazzi; and the man Rachel has spent
  her entire life waiting to meet: her father. Meanwhile, Singapore''s It Girl, Astrid
  Leong, is shocked to discover that there is a downside to having a newly minted
  tech billionaire husband. <br /><br />A romp through Asia''s most exclusive clubs,
  auction houses, and estates, <i>China Rich Girlfriend</i> brings us into the elite
  circles of Mainland China, introducing a captivating cast of characters, and offering
  an inside glimpse at what it''s like to be gloriously, crazily, China-rich.'
