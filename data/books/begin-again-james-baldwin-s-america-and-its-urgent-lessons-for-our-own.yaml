description: "<b>James Baldwin grew disillusioned by the failure of the Civil Rights\
  \ movement to force America to confront its lies about race. In the era of Trump,\
  \ what can we learn from his struggle?</b><br /><br /><i>\"Not everything is lost.\
  \ Responsibility cannot be lost, it can only be abdicated. If one refuses abdication,\
  \ one begins again.\"</i> \u2014James Baldwin<br /><br />We live, according to Eddie\
  \ S. Glaude, Jr., in the <i>after times</i>, when the promise of Black Lives Matter\
  \ and the attempt to achieve a new America was met with the election of Donald Trump,\
  \ a racist president whose victory represents yet another failure of America to\
  \ face the lies it tells itself about race.<br /><br />We have been here before:\
  \ For James Baldwin, the after times came in the wake of the Civil Rights movement,\
  \ when a similar attempt to compel a national confrontation with the truth was answered\
  \ with the murders of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr. In these\
  \ years, spanning from the publication of <i>The Fire Next Time</i> in 1963 to that\
  \ of <i>No Name in the Street</i> in 1972, Baldwin was transformed into a more overtly\
  \ political writer, a change that came at great professional and personal cost.\
  \ But from that journey, Baldwin emerged with a sense of renewed purpose about the\
  \ necessity of pushing forward in the face of disillusionment and despair.<br /><br\
  \ />In the story of Baldwin's crucible, Glaude suggests, we can find hope and guidance\
  \ through our own after times, this Trumpian era of shattered promises and white\
  \ retrenchment. Mixing biography\u2014drawn partially from newly uncovered interviews\u2014\
  with history, memoir, and trenchant analysis of our current moment, <i>Begin Again</i>\
  \ is Glaude's attempt, following Baldwin, to bear witness to the difficult truth\
  \ of race in America today. It is at once a searing exploration that lays bare the\
  \ tangled web of race, trauma, and memory, and a powerful interrogation of what\
  \ we all must ask of ourselves in order to call forth a new America."
