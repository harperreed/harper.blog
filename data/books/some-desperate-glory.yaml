description: "A thrillingly told queer space opera about the wreckage of war, the\
  \ family you find, and who you must become when every choice is stripped from you,\
  \ Some Desperate Glory is Astounding Award Winner Emily Tesh\u2019s highly anticipated\
  \ debut novel. <br /><br />While we live, the enemy shall fear us. <br /><br />Since\
  \ she was born, Kyr has trained for the day she can avenge the murder of planet\
  \ Earth. Raised in the bowels of Gaea Station alongside the last scraps of humanity,\
  \ she readies herself to face the Wisdom, the powerful, reality-shaping weapon that\
  \ gave the majoda their victory over humanity.<br /><br />They are what\u2019s left.\
  \ They are what must survive. Kyr is one of the best warriors of her generation,\
  \ the sword of a dead planet. When Command assigns her brother to certain death\
  \ and relegates her to Nursery to bear sons until she dies trying, she knows she\
  \ must take humanity's revenge into her own hands.<br /><br />Alongside her brother\u2019\
  s brilliant but seditious friend and a lonely, captive alien, Kyr escapes from everything\
  \ she\u2019s known into a universe far more complicated than she was taught and\
  \ far more wondrous than she could have imagined.<br /><br />At the Publisher's\
  \ request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM)\
  \ applied."
