description: "<p>The story of the young sociologist who studied a Chicago crack-dealing\
  \ gang from the inside captured the world's attention when it was first described\
  \ in <i>Freakonomics</i>. <i>Gang Leader for a Day</i> is the fascinating full story\
  \ of how Sudhir Venkatesh managed to gain entr\xE9e into the gang, what he learned,\
  \ and how his method revolutionized the academic establishment. </p> <p> When Venkatesh\
  \ walked into an abandoned building in one of Chicago's most notorious housing projects,\
  \ he was looking for people to take a multiple-choice survey on urban poverty. A\
  \ first-year grad student, he would befriend a gang leader named JT and spend the\
  \ better part of the next decade inside the projects under JT's protection, documenting\
  \ what he saw there. </p> <p> Over the next seven years, Venkatesh observed JT and\
  \ the rest of the gang as they operated their crack selling business, conducted\
  \ PR within their community, and rose up or fell within the ranks of the gang's\
  \ complex organizational structure. </p> <p> <i>Gang Leader for a Day</i> is an\
  \ inside view into the morally ambiguous, highly intricate, often corrupt struggle\
  \ to survive in an urban war zone. It is also the story of a complicated friendship\
  \ between two young and ambitious men, a universe apart. </p>"
