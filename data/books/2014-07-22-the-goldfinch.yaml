description: 'Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction 2014<br /><br />Aged thirteen,
  Theo Decker, son of a devoted mother and a reckless, largely absent father, survives
  an accident that otherwise tears his life apart. Alone and rudderless in New York,
  he is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. He is tormented by an unbearable
  longing for his mother, and down the years clings to the thing that most reminds
  him of her: a small, strangely captivating painting that ultimately draws him into
  the criminal underworld. As he grows up, Theo learns to glide between the drawing
  rooms of the rich and the dusty antiques store where he works. He is alienated and
  in love - and his talisman, the painting, places him at the centre of a narrowing,
  ever more dangerous circle.<br /><br />The Goldfinch is a haunted odyssey through
  present-day America and a drama of enthralling power. Combining unforgettably vivid
  characters and thrilling suspense, it is a beautiful, addictive triumph - a sweeping
  story of loss and obsession, of survival and self-invention, of the deepest mysteries
  of love, identity and fate.'
