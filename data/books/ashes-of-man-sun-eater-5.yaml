description: 'The fifth novel of the galaxy-spanning Sun Eater series merges the best
  of space opera and epic fantasy, as Hadrian Marlowe continues down a path that can
  only end in fire.<br /><br />The galaxy is burning.<br /> <br />With the Cielcin
  united under one banner, the Sollan Empire stands alone after the betrayal of the
  Commonwealth. The Prophet-King of the Cielcin has sent its armies to burn the worlds
  of men, and worse, there are rumors...whispers that Hadrian Marlowe is dead, killed
  in the fighting.<br /> <br />But it is not so. Hadrian survived with the help of
  the witch, Valka, and together they escaped the net of the enemy having learned
  a terrible truth: the gods that the Cielcin worship are real and will not rest until
  the universe is dark and cold.<br /> <br />What is more, the Emperor himself is
  in danger. The Prophet-King has learned to track his movements as he travels along
  the borders of Imperial space. Now the Cielcin legions are closing in, their swords
  poised to strike off the head of all mankind.'
