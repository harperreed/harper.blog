description: Dylan Jones's engrossing, magisterial biography of David Bowie is unlike
  any Bowie story ever written. Drawn from over 180 interviews with friends, rivals,
  lovers, and collaborators, some of whom have never before spoken about their relationship
  with Bowie, this oral history weaves a hypnotic spell as it unfolds the story of
  a remarkable rise to stardom and an unparalleled artistic path. Tracing Bowie's
  life from the English suburbs to London to New York to Los Angeles, Berlin, and
  beyond, its collective voices describe a man profoundly shaped by his relationship
  with his schizophrenic half-brother Terry; an intuitive artist who could absorb
  influences through intense relationships and yet drop people cold when they were
  no longer of use; and a social creature equally comfortable partying with John Lennon
  and dining with Frank Sinatra. By turns insightful and deliciously gossipy, DAVID
  BOWIE is as intimate a portrait as may ever be drawn. It sparks with admiration
  and grievances, lust and envy, as the speakers bring you into studios and bedrooms
  they shared with Bowie, and onto stages and film sets, opening corners of his mind
  and experience that transform our understanding of both artist and art. Including
  illuminating, never-before-seen material from Bowie himself, drawn from a series
  of Jones's interviews with him across two decades, DAVID BOWIE is an epic, unforgettable
  cocktail-party conversation about a man whose enigmatic shapeshifting and irrepressible
  creativity produced one of the most sprawling, fascinating lives of our time.
