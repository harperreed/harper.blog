description: "<i>\u201COur Dragon doesn\u2019t eat the girls he takes, no matter what\
  \ stories they tell outside our valley. We hear them sometimes, from travelers passing\
  \ through. They talk as though we were doing human sacrifice, and he were a real\
  \ dragon. Of course that\u2019s not true: he may be a wizard and immortal, but he\u2019\
  s still a man, and our fathers would band together and kill him if he wanted to\
  \ eat one of us every ten years. He protects us against the Wood, and we\u2019re\
  \ grateful, but not that grateful.\u201D</i><br /><br />Agnieszka loves her valley\
  \ home, her quiet village, the forests and the bright shining river. But the corrupted\
  \ Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over\
  \ her life.<br /><br />Her people rely on the cold, driven wizard known only as\
  \ the Dragon to keep its powers at bay. But he demands a terrible price for his\
  \ help: one young woman handed over to serve him for ten years, a fate almost as\
  \ terrible as falling to the Wood.<br /><br />But Agnieszka fears the wrong things.\
  \ For when the Dragon comes, it is not Kasia he will choose."
