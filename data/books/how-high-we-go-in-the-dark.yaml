description: "<b>\"Haunting and luminous, <i>How High We Go in the Dark</i> orchestrates\
  \ its multitude of memorable voices into beautiful and lucid science fiction. An\
  \ astonishing debut.\" \u2014Alan Moore, creator of <i>Watchmen</i> and <i>V for\
  \ Vendetta</i><br /><br />\"Epic . . . Sequoia Nagamatsu is a writer whose imagination\
  \ is matched only by his compassion, the kind we need to light our way through the\
  \ dark.\" \u2014Chloe Benjamin, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The\
  \ Immortalists</i> <br /><br />Recommended by <i>New York Times Book Review</i>\
  \ \u2022 <i>Los Angeles Times</i> \u2022 <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> \u2022 <i>Esquire</i>\

  \ \u2022 <i>The Guardian</i> \u2022 PopSugar \u2022 Literary Hub \u2022 and many\
  \ more!<br /><br />For fans of <i>Cloud Atlas</i> and <i>Station Eleven</i>, a spellbinding\
  \ and profoundly prescient debut that follows a cast of intricately linked characters\
  \ over hundreds of years as humanity struggles to rebuild itself in the aftermath\
  \ of a climate plague\u2014a daring and deeply heartfelt work of mind-bending imagination\
  \ from a singular new voice.</b><br /><br />In 2030, a grieving archeologist arrives\
  \ in the Arctic Circle to continue the work of his recently deceased daughter at\
  \ the Batagaika Crater, where researchers are studying long-buried secrets now revealed\
  \ in melting permafrost, including the perfectly preserved remains of a girl who\
  \ appears to have died of an ancient virus.<br /><br />Once unleashed, the Arctic\
  \ plague will reshape life on Earth for generations to come, quickly traversing\
  \ the globe, forcing humanity to devise a myriad of moving and inventive ways to\
  \ embrace possibility in the face of tragedy. In a theme park designed for terminally\
  \ ill children, a cynical employee falls in love with a mother desperate to hold\
  \ on to her infected son. A heartbroken scientist searching for a cure finds a second\
  \ chance at fatherhood when one of his test subjects\u2014a pig\u2014develops the\
  \ capacity for human speech. A widowed painter and her teenaged granddaughter embark\
  \ on a cosmic quest to locate a new home planet. <br /><br />From funerary skyscrapers\
  \ to hotels for the dead to interstellar starships, Sequoia Nagamatsu takes readers\
  \ on a wildly original and compassionate journey, spanning continents, centuries,\
  \ and even celestial bodies to tell a story about the resilience of the human spirit,\
  \ our infinite capacity to dream, and the connective threads that tie us all together\
  \ in the universe.<br /><br /><b>\"Wondrous, and not just in the feats of imagination,\
  \ which are so numerous it makes me dizzy to recall them, but also in the humanity\
  \ and tenderness with which Sequoia Nagamatsu helps us navigate this landscape.\
  \ . . . This is a truly amazing book, one to keep close as we imagine the uncertain\
  \ future.\" \u2014Kevin Wilson, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Nothing\
  \ to See Here</i></b>"
