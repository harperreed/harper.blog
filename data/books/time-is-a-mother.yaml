description: "The highly anticipated collection of poems from the award-winning writer\
  \ Ocean Vuong<br /><br />How else do we return to ourselves but to fold<br />The\
  \ page so it points to the good part<br /><br />In this deeply intimate second poetry\
  \ collection, Ocean Vuong searches for life among the aftershocks of his mother\u2019\
  s death, embodying the paradox of sitting within grief while being determined to\
  \ survive beyond it. Shifting through memory, and in concert with the themes of\
  \ his novel On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous, Vuong contends with personal loss,\
  \ the meaning of family, and the cost of being the product of an American war in\
  \ America. At once vivid, brave, and propulsive, Vuong\u2019s poems circle fragmented\
  \ lives to find both restoration as well as the epicenter of the break.<br /><br\
  \ />The author of the critically acclaimed poetry collection Night Sky With Exit\
  \ Wounds, winner of the 2016 Whiting Award, the 2017 T. S. Eliot Prize, and a 2019\
  \ MacArthur fellow, Vuong writes directly to our humanity without losing sight of\
  \ the current moment. These poems represent a more innovative and daring experimentation\
  \ with language and form, illuminating how the themes we perennially live in and\
  \ question are truly inexhaustible. Bold and prescient, and a testament to tenderness\
  \ in the face of violence, Time Is a Mother is a return and a forging forth all\
  \ at once."
