description: "<b>An atmospheric tale of corruption and abduction set on Mars, from\
  \ the author of the award-winning science fiction novel <i>Altered Carbon, </i>now\
  \ an exciting new series from Netflix.</b><br /><b>\_</b><br /> From the moment\
  \ Richard K. Morgan\u2019s dazzling debut, <i>Altered Carbon,</i> burst onto the\
  \ scene, it was clear that a distinctive new voice had arrived to shake up science\
  \ fiction. His subsequent novels\u2014including the sequels <i>Broken Angels</i>\
  \ and <i>Woken Furies</i>\u2014confirmed him as a master of hard-boiled futuristic\
  \ thrillers. Now Morgan returns to the world of SF noir with a riveting tale of\
  \ crime, corruption, and deadly crisis on a planet teetering close to the edge.<br\
  \ /><br /> On a Mars where ruthless corporate interests violently collide with a\
  \ homegrown independence movement as Earth-based overlords battle for profits and\
  \ power, Hakan Veil is an ex\u2013professional enforcer equipped with military-grade\
  \ body tech that\u2019s made him a human killing machine. But he\u2019s had enough\
  \ of the turbulent red planet, and all he wants is a ticket back home\u2014which\
  \ is just what he\u2019s offered by the Earth Oversight organization, in exchange\
  \ for being the bodyguard for an EO investigator. It\u2019s a beyond-easy gig for\
  \ a heavy hitter like Veil . . . until it isn\u2019t.<br /><br /> When Veil\u2019\
  s charge, Madison Madekwe, starts looking into the mysterious disappearance of a\
  \ lottery winner, she stirs up a hornet\u2019s nest of intrigue and murder. And\
  \ the deeper Veil is drawn into the dangerous game being played, the more long-buried\
  \ secrets claw their way to the Martian surface. Now it\u2019s the expert assassin\
  \ on the wrong end of a lethal weapon\u2014as Veil stands targeted by powerful enemies\
  \ hellbent on taking him down, by any means necessary."
