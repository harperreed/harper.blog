description: "<b>The first book of the Scholomance trilogy is the story of an unwilling\
  \ dark sorceress who is destined to rewrite the rules of magic.</b><br /><br />I\
  \ decided that Orion Lake needed to die after the second time he saved my life.<br\
  \ /><br />Everyone loves Orion Lake. Everyone else, that is. Far as I\u2019m concerned,\
  \ he can keep his flashy combat magic to himself. I\u2019m not joining his pack\
  \ of adoring fans.<br /><br />I don\u2019t need help surviving the Scholomance,\
  \ even if they do. Forget the hordes of monsters and cursed artifacts, I\u2019m\
  \ probably the most dangerous thing in the place. Just give me a chance and I\u2019\
  ll level mountains and kill untold millions, make myself the dark queen of the world.<br\
  \ /><br />At least, that\u2019s what the world expects. Most of the other students\
  \ in here would be delighted if Orion killed me like one more evil thing that\u2019\
  s crawled out of the drains. Sometimes I think they want me to turn into the evil\
  \ witch they assume I am. The school certainly does.<br /><br />But the Scholomance\
  \ isn\u2019t getting what it wants from me. And neither is Orion Lake. I may not\
  \ be anyone\u2019s idea of the shining hero, but I\u2019m going to make it out of\
  \ this place alive, and I\u2019m not going to slaughter thousands to do it, either.<br\
  \ /><br />Although I\u2019m giving serious consideration to <i>just one.</i>"
