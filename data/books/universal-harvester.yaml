description: 'Jeremy works at the counter of Video Hut in Nevada, Iowa. It''s the
  1990s, pre-DVD, and the work is predictable and familiar; he likes his boss, and
  it gets him out of the house. But when a local schoolteacher comes in to return
  her copy of Targets, she has an odd complaint: ''There''s something on it,'' she
  says. Two days later, another customer brings back She''s All That and complains
  that something is wrong: ''There''s another movie on this tape.'' Curious, Jeremy
  takes a look. And what he sees on the videos is so strange and disturbing that it
  propels him out of his comfortable routine and into a search for the tapes'' creator.
  As the once-peaceful fields and barns of the Iowa landscape begin to seem sinister
  and threatening, Jeremy must come to terms with a truth that is as devastatingly
  sad as it is shocking.'
