description: 'When the planet of Moscow was annihilated, its few survivors launched
  a counter-attack against the most likely culprit: the neighboring system of New
  Dresden. But New Dresden wasn''t responsible, and as the deadly missiles approach
  their target, Rachel Mansour, agent for the interests of Old Earth, is assigned
  to find out who was. <br /><br /> And the one person who knows is a disaffected
  teenager who calls herself Wednesday Shadowmist. But Wednesday has no idea what
  she knows...'
