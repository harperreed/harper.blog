description: "When Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her boyfriend,\
  \ Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives to explore the\
  \ island, and quality time with the man she might one day marry. What she doesn't\
  \ know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace, that she'll ride\
  \ in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's most eligible bachelors\
  \ on her arm, <br /><br />Rachel might as well have a target on her back. Initiated\
  \ into a world of dynastic splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the\
  \ It Girl of Singapore society; Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages\
  \ of the Hong Kong socialite magazines; and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a\
  \ woman who has very strong feelings about who her son should--and should not--marry.\
  \ <br /><br />Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping opulence, <i>Crazy\
  \ Rich Asians</i> is an insider's look at the Asian JetSet; a perfect depiction\
  \ of the clash between old money and new money; between Overseas Chinese and Mainland\
  \ Chinese; and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously,\_\
  <i>crazily</i>\_rich."
