description: '<b>A timely and uncanny portrait of a world in the wake of fake news,
  diminished privacy, and a total shutdown of the Internet</b><br /><br />BEFORE:
  In Bristol''s center lies the Croft, a digital no-man''s-land cut off from the surveillance,
  Big Data dependence, and corporate-sponsored, globally hegemonic aspirations that
  have overrun the rest of the world. Ten years in, it''s become a center of creative
  counterculture. But it''s fraying at the edges, radicalizing from inside. How will
  it fare when its chief architect, Rushdi Mannan, takes off to meet his boyfriend
  in New York City--now the apotheosis of the new techno-utopian global metropolis?<br
  /><br />AFTER: An act of anonymous cyberterrorism has permanently switched off the
  Internet. Global trade, travel, and communication have collapsed. The luxuries that
  characterized modern life are scarce. In the Croft, Mary--who has visions of people
  presumed dead--is sought out by grieving families seeking connections to lost ones.
  But does Mary have a gift or is she just hustling to stay alive? Like Grids, who
  runs the Croft''s black market like personal turf. Or like Tyrone, who hoards music
  (culled from cassettes, the only medium to survive the crash) and tattered sneakers
  like treasure.<br /><br />The world of <i>Infinite Detail</i> is a small step shy
  of our own: utterly dependent on technology, constantly brokering autonomy and privacy
  for comfort and convenience. With <i>Infinite Detail</i>, Tim Maughan makes the
  hitherto-unimaginable come true: the End of the Internet, the End of the World as
  We Know It.'
