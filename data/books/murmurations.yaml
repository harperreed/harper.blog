description: "When a biological weapon decimates the population, Julie feels . . .\
  \ relieved. To her, the apocalypse doesn\u2019t seem any more dangerous than navigating\
  \ the world before, when she spent all her energy trying to avoid the treachery\
  \ of human beings. Years of abuse have left her broken in some way, unable to trust.\
  \ The dangers of the new world force her to barricade herself in the safety of her\
  \ house, which also feels familiar, since she\u2019s been doing the emotional equivalent\
  \ for years. Alone with her dog and the murmurations\u2014an inexplicable phenomenon\
  \ that\u2019s been with her as long as she can remember\u2014Julie gets by as she\
  \ always has, through a combination of luck and grit. But when her solitude is shattered\
  \ by the arrival of strangers, Julie is forced to decide if she wants to live rather\
  \ than just survive, and whether it\u2019s too late to unearth her humanity now\
  \ that most of humanity is gone."
