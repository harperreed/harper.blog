description: "Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission\u2014\
  and if he fails, humanity and the Earth itself will perish.<br /><br />Except that\
  \ right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his own name, let alone\
  \ the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.<br /><br />All he knows is\
  \ that he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened\
  \ to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for\
  \ company.<br /><br />His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, he realizes\
  \ that an impossible task now confronts him. Alone on this tiny ship that's been\
  \ cobbled together by every government and space agency on the planet and hurled\
  \ into the depths of space, it's up to him to conquer an extinction-level threat\
  \ to our species.<br /><br />And thanks to an unexpected ally, he just might have\
  \ a chance.<br /><br />Part scientific mystery, part dazzling interstellar journey,\
  \ <i>Project Hail Mary</i> is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to\
  \ rival <i>The Martian</i>--while taking us to places it never dreamed of going."
