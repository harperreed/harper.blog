description: '<b>In <i>A Psalm for the Wild-Built</i>, Hugo Award-winner Becky Chambers''s
  delightful new Monk and Robot series gives us hope for the future.</b><br /><br
  />It''s been centuries since the robots of Panga gained self-awareness and laid
  down their tools; centuries since they wandered, en masse, into the wilderness,
  never to be seen again; centuries since they faded into myth and urban legend.<br
  /><br />One day, the life of a tea monk is upended by the arrival of a robot, there
  to honor the old promise of checking in. The robot cannot go back until the question
  of "what do people need?" is answered. <br /><br />But the answer to that question
  depends on who you ask, and how.<br /><br />They''re going to need to ask it a <i>lot.</i><br
  /><br />Becky Chambers''s new series asks: in a world where people have what they
  want, does having more matter?'
