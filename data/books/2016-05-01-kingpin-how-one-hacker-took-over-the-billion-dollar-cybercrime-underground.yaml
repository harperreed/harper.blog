description: 'The true story of Max Butler, the master hacker who ran a billion dollar
  cyber crime network.<br /><br />The word spread through the hacking underground
  like some unstoppable new virus: an audacious crook had staged a hostile takeover
  of an online criminal network that siphoned billions of dollars from the US economy.<br
  /><br />The culprit was a brilliant programmer with a hippie ethic and a supervillain''s
  double identity. Max ''Vision'' Butler was a white-hat hacker and a celebrity throughout
  the programming world, even serving as a consultant to the FBI. But there was another
  side to Max. As the black-hat ''Iceman'', he''d seen the fraudsters around him squabble,
  their ranks riddled with infiltrators, their methods inefficient, and in their dysfunction
  was the ultimate challenge: he would stage a coup and steal their ill-gotten gains
  from right under their noses.<br /><br />Through the story of Max Butler''s remarkable
  rise, KINGPIN lays bare the workings of a silent crime wave affecting millions worldwide.
  It exposes vast online-fraud supermarkets stocked with credit card numbers, counterfeit
  cheques, hacked bank accounts and fake passports. Thanks to Kevin Poulsen''s remarkable
  access to both cops and criminals, we step inside the quiet,desperate battle that
  law enforcement fights against these scammers. And learn that the boy next door
  may not be all he seems.'
