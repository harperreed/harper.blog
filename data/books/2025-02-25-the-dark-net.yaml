description: At any given moment, 5% of the Internet is hidden from view - that's
  the Dark Net. It's a haven for criminals, spies, and nefarious hackers. For Max
  Caine it's also a death trap, where reality and the virtual world collide. Join
  Max and Betty3.5, and their virtual penguin Linus, as they explore the darkest recesses
  of the Internet. This cyber thriller will take you on a wild ride into the not-too-distant
  future where conveniences from auto-piloted cars to wearable computers and biometric
  ATMs ensure that everyone is online, one way or another, every waking moment. But
  continual connection has a price. As Max discovers in his journeys through the Dark
  Net -- you can log out any time you want, but you can never leave.
