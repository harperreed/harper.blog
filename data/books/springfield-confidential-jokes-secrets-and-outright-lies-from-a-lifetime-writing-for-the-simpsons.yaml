description: "<strong>In celebration of <em>The Simpsons</em> thirtieth anniversary,\
  \ the show\u2019s longest-serving writer and producer offers a humorous look at\
  \ the writing and making of the legendary Fox series that has become one of the\
  \ most revered artistic achievements in television history.</strong><br /><br />Four-time\
  \ Emmy winner Mike Reiss\u2014who has worked on<em> The Simpsons</em> continuously\
  \ since episode one in 1989\u2014shares stories, scandals, and gossip about working\
  \ with America\u2019s most iconic cartoon family ever. Reiss explains how the episodes\
  \ are created, and provides an inside look at the show\u2019s writers, animators,\
  \ actors and celebrity guests. He answers a range of questions from <em>Simpsons</em>\
  \ fans and die-hards, and reminisces about the making of perennially favorite episodes.<br\
  \ /><br />In his freewheeling, irreverent comic style, Reiss reflects on his lifetime\
  \ inside <em>The Simpsons</em>\u2014a personal highlights reel of his achievements,\
  \ observations, and favorite stories. <em>Springfield Confidential</em> exposes\
  \ why Matt Groening decided to make all of the characters yellow; dishes on what\
  \ it\u2019s like to be crammed in a room full of funny writers sixty hours a week;\
  \ and tells what Reiss learned after traveling to seventy-one countries where <em>The\
  \ Simpsons</em> is watched (ironic note: there\u2019s no electricity in many of\
  \ these places); and even reveals where Springfield is located! He features unique\
  \ interviews with Judd Apatow, who also provided the foreword,\_and Conan O'Brien,\
  \ as well as with Simpsons legends Al Jean, Nancy Cartwright, Dan Castellaneta,\
  \ and more.<br /><br />Like Cary Elwes\u2019 <em>As You Wish</em>, Jennifer Keishin\
  \ Armstrong\u2019s <em>Seinfeldia</em>, and Chris Smith\u2019s <em>The Daily Show:\
  \ An Oral History</em>, <em>Springfield Confidential</em> is a funny, informational,\
  \ and exclusive look at one of the most beloved programs in all of television land."
