description: Revising and updating his classic 1958 translation, Paul Roche captures
  the dramatic power and intensity, the subtleties of meaning, and the explosive emotions
  of Sophocles' great Theban trilogy. In vivid, poetic language, he presents the timeless
  story of a noble family moving toward catastrophe, dragged down from wealth and
  power by pride, cursed with incest, suicide, and murder.
