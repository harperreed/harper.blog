description: '"The tragedies keep coming. As we reel from the latest horror . . .
  " So begins a new epilogue, illustrating how Columbine became the template for nearly
  two decades of "spectacle murders." It is a false script, seized upon by a generation
  of new killers. In the wake of Newtown, Aurora, and Virginia Tech, the imperative
  to understand the crime that sparked this plague grows more urgent every year.<br
  /><br />What really happened April 20, 1999? The horror left an indelible stamp
  on the American psyche, but most of what we "know" is wrong. It wasn''t about jocks,
  Goths, or the Trench Coat Mafia. Dave Cullen was one of the first reporters on scene,
  and spent ten years on this book-widely recognized as the definitive account. With
  a keen investigative eye and psychological acumen, he draws on mountains of evidence,
  insight from the world''s leading forensic psychologists, and the killers'' own
  words and drawings-several reproduced in a new appendix. Cullen paints raw portraits
  of two polar opposite killers. They contrast starkly with the flashes of resilience
  and redemption among the survivors.'
