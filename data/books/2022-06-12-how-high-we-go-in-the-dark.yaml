description: Dr. Cliff Miyashiro arrives in the Arctic Circle to continue his recently
  deceased daughter's research, only to discover a virus, newly unearthed from melting
  permafrost. The plague unleashed reshapes life on earth for generations. Yet even
  while struggling to counter this destructive force, humanity stubbornly persists
  in myriad moving and ever inventive ways.<br /><br />Among those adjusting to this
  new normal are an aspiring comedian, employed by a theme park designed for terminally
  ill children, who falls in love with a mother trying desperately to keep her son
  alive; a scientist who, having failed to save his own son from the plague, gets
  a second chance at fatherhood when one of his test subjects-a pig-develops human
  speech; a man who, after recovering from his own coma, plans a block party for his
  neighbours who have also woken up to find that they alone have survived their families;
  and a widowed painter and her teenaged granddaughter who must set off on cosmic
  quest to locate a new home planet.<br /><br />From funerary skyscrapers to hotels
  for the dead, How High We Go in the Dark follows a cast of intricately linked characters
  spanning hundreds of years as humanity endeavours to restore the delicate balance
  of the world. This is a story of unshakable hope that crosses literary lines to
  give us a world rebuilding itself through an endless capacity for love, resilience
  and reinvention. Wonderful and disquieting, dreamlike and all too possible.
