description: "<b>The greatest dangers hide the brightest treasures in this bold, planet-hopping\
  \ science fiction adventure series.</b><b>\n  <br /></b>The crew of the legendary\
  \ Capricious are rich enough to retire in comfort for the rest of their days, but\
  \ none of it matters if the galaxy is still in danger. <br />Nilah and Boots, the\
  \ ship's newest crew-members hear the word of a mysterious cult that may have links\
  \ back to an ancient and all-powerful magic. To find it, hot-headed Nilah will have\
  \ to go undercover and find the source of their power without revealing her true\
  \ identity. Meanwhile, Boots is forced to confront the one person she'd hoped never\
  \ to see again: her old, turn-coat treasure-hunting partner.<b>\n  <br /></b><b>The\
  \ Salvagers</b><i>A Big Ship at the Edge of the Universe</i><i>A Bad Deal for the\
  \ Whole Galaxy</i><i>The Worst of All Possible Worlds</i>"
