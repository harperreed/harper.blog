description: "Earl\u2019s All-You-Can-Eat is home away from home for this inseparable\
  \ Plainview, Indiana, trio. Dubbed \u201Cthe Supremes\u201D by high school pals\
  \ in the tumultuous 1960s, they weather life\u2019s storms together for the next\
  \ four decades. Now, during their most challenging year yet, dutiful, proud, and\
  \ talented Clarice must struggle to keep up appearances as she deals with her husband\u2019\
  s humiliating infidelities. Beautiful, fragile Barbara Jean is rocked by the tragic\
  \ reverberations of a youthful love affair. And fearless Odette engages in the most\
  \ terrifying battle of her life while contending with the idea that she has inherited\
  \ more than her broad frame from her notorious pot-smoking mother, Dora.<br /><br\
  \ />Through marriage, children, happiness, and the blues, these strong, funny women\
  \ gather each Sundayat the same table at Earl\u2019s diner for delicious food, juicy\
  \ gossip, occasional tears, and uproarious banter."
