description: In a decadent world of cheap pleasures and easy death, Marid Audrian
  has kept his independence the hard way. Still, like everything else in the Budayeen,
  he's available....for a price. For a new kind of killer roams the streets of the
  Arab ghetto, a madman whose bootlegged personality cartridges range from a sinister
  James Bond to a sadistic disemboweler named Khan. And Marid Audrian has been made
  an offer he cant refuse. The two hundred-year-old godfather of the Budayeens underworld
  has enlisted Marid as his instrument of vengeance. But first Marid must undergo
  the most sophisticated of surgical implants before he dares to confront a killer
  who carries the power of every psychopath since the beginning of time. Wry, savage,
  and not to be ignored, When Gravity Fails was hailed as a classic by Effingers fellow
  SF writers on its original publication in 1987, and the sequence of Marid Audrian
  novels it began were the culmination of his career.
