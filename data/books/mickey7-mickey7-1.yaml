description: "<i>Dying isn\u2019t any fun\u2026but at least it\u2019s a living.</i><br\
  \ /><br />Mickey7 is an Expendable: a disposable employee on a human expedition\
  \ sent to colonize the ice world Niflheim. Whenever there\u2019s a mission that\u2019\
  s too dangerous\u2014even suicidal\u2014the crew turns to Mickey. After one iteration\
  \ dies, a new body is regenerated with most of his memories intact. After six deaths,\
  \ Mickey7 understands the terms of his deal\u2026and why it was the only colonial\
  \ position unfilled when he took it.<br /><br />On a fairly routine scouting mission,\
  \ Mickey7 goes missing and is presumed dead. By the time he returns to the colony\
  \ base, surprisingly helped back by native life, Mickey7\u2019s fate has been sealed.\
  \ There\u2019s a new clone, Mickey8, reporting for Expendable duties. The idea of\
  \ duplicate Expendables is universally loathed, and if caught, they will likely\
  \ be thrown into the recycler for protein.<br /><br />Mickey7 must keep his double\
  \ a secret from the rest of the colony. Meanwhile, life on Niflheim is getting worse.\
  \ The atmosphere is unsuitable for humans, food is in short supply, and terraforming\
  \ is going poorly. The native species are growing curious about their new neighbors,\
  \ and that curiosity has Commander Marshall very afraid. Ultimately, the survival\
  \ of both lifeforms will come down to Mickey7.<br /><br />That is, if he can just\
  \ keep from dying for good."
