description: "<p>Rin\u2019s story continues in this acclaimed sequel to <em>The Poppy\
  \ War</em>\u2014an epic fantasy combining the history of twentieth-century China\
  \ with a gripping world of gods and monsters.<br /><br /><em>The war is over.</em></p><p>\n\
  \  <em>The war has just begun.</em>\n</p><p>Three times throughout its history,\
  \ Nikan has fought for its survival in the bloody Poppy Wars. Though the third battle\
  \ has just ended, shaman and warrior Rin cannot forget the atrocity she committed\
  \ to save her people. Now she is on the run from her guilt, the opium addiction\
  \ that holds her like a vice, and the murderous commands of the fiery Phoenix\u2014\
  the vengeful god who has blessed Rin with her fearsome power. </p><p>Though she\
  \ does not want to live, she refuses to die until she avenges the traitorous Empress\
  \ who betrayed Rin\u2019s homeland to its enemies. Her only hope is to join forces\
  \ with the powerful Dragon Warlord, who plots to conquer Nikan, unseat the Empress,\
  \ and create a new republic. </p><p>But neither the Empress nor the Dragon Warlord\
  \ are what they seem. The more Rin witnesses, the more she fears her love for Nikan\
  \ will force her to use the Phoenix\u2019s deadly power once more. </p><p>Because\
  \ there is nothing Rin won\u2019t sacrifice to save her country . . . and exact\
  \ her vengeance.</p>"
