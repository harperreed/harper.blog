      description: "Brandon Sanderson's epic fantasy cycle tells the story of Roshar,\
        \ a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep\
        \ across the rocky terrain. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten\
        \ consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and\
        \ Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary\
        \ men into near-invincible warriors. As brutal wars rage over the control\
        \ of these magical weapons, an ancient text called The Way of Kings tells\
        \ of ancient times, the Knights Radiant, and perhaps the true cause of the\
        \ war. The Knights Radiant must stand again.\n    \n    https://us.macmillan.com/series/thestormlightarchive\n\
        \    \n    #0.5, <I>The Way of Kings Prime</I>, was written in 2002 and is\
        \ basically an alternate version of <I>The Way of Kings</I>, which was published\
        \ by Tor Books in 2010. <I>The Way of Kings Prime</I> is very different from\
        \ the published book. Think of it as set in a different universe with a completely\
        \ different plot. <B>If you haven\u2019t read the 2010 canonical version,\
        \ please read that one first.</B> -- from author's website (emphasis mine)\n\
        \    \n    One novel set in this world is the short story \"Rysn\" from the\
        \ anthology Epic - Legends of Fantasy. \n    \n    The Stormlight Archive\
        \ series will have 10 books: first five books will form first part sequence,\
        \ while other five books will form the second part of the series.\n    \n\
