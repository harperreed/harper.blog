      description: "\n\n    The trilogy is set in a universe with a wealth of worlds\
        \ and artificial orbiting colonies. The plot is centered on the souls of the\
        \ dead coming back from a hellish \"beyond\" to possess the living, and the\
        \ latter fighting back. It was followed by a companion to the series, The\
        \ Confederation Handbook, an informational book containing data about the\
        \ universe of the Night's Dawn trilogy. Hamilton re-set several earlier short\
        \ stories in the Confederation timeline, published as the collection A Second\
        \ Chance at Eden, including the newly written title novella.\n\n"
