description: "From idyllic small towns to claustrophobic urban landscapes, Mallory\
  \ Viridian is constantly embroiled in murder cases that only she has the insight\
  \ to solve. But outside of a classic mystery novel, being surrounded by death doesn\u2019\
  t make you a charming amateur detective, it makes you a suspect and a social pariah.\
  \ So when Mallory gets the opportunity to take refuge on a sentient space station,\
  \ she thinks she has the solution. Surely the murders will stop if her only company\
  \ is alien beings. At first her new existence is peacefully quiet\u2026and markedly\
  \ devoid of homicide.<br /> <br />But when the station agrees to allow additional\
  \ human guests, Mallory knows the break from her peculiar reality is over. After\
  \ the first Earth shuttle arrives, and aliens and humans alike begin to die, the\
  \ station is thrown into peril. Stuck smack-dab in the middle of an extraterrestrial\
  \ whodunit, and wondering how in the world this keeps happening to her anyway, Mallory\
  \ has to solve the crime\u2014and fast\u2014or the list of victims could grow to\
  \ include everyone on board\u2026."
