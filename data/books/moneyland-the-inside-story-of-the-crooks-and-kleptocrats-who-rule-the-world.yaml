description: "<p>\n  <b>\"If you want to know why international crooks and their eminently\
  \ respectable financial advisors walk tall and only the little people pay taxes,\
  \ this is the ideal book for you. Every politician and moneyman on the planet should\
  \ read it, but they won't because it's actually about them.\" \u2014John le Carr\xE9\
  , author of <i>A Legacy of Spies</i></b>\n  <br />\n  <b>\n    <i></i>\n  </b>\n\
  \  <br />\n  <b>\n    <i></i>\n  </b>\n  <i>An investigative journalist's deep dive\
  \ into the corrupt workings of the world's kleptocrats.</i>\n</p><p>From ruined\
  \ towns on the edge of Siberia, to Bond-villain lairs in London and Manhattan, something\
  \ has gone wrong. Kleptocracies, governments run by corrupt leaders that prosper\
  \ at the expense of their people, are on the rise.</p><p> Once upon a time, if an\
  \ official stole money, there wasn't much he could do with it. He could buy himself\
  \ a new car or build himself a nice house or give it to his friends and family,\
  \ but that was about it. If he kept stealing, the money would just pile up in his\
  \ house until he had no rooms left to put it in, or it was eaten by mice.</p><p>\
  \ And then some bankers had a bright idea.</p><p> Join the investigative journalist\
  \ Oliver Bullough on a journey into Moneyland \u2014 the secret country of the lawless,\
  \ stateless superrich.</p><p> Learn how the institutions of Europe and the United\
  \ States have become money-laundering operations, attacking the foundations of many\
  \ of the world's most stable countries. Meet the kleptocrats. Meet their awful children.\
  \ And find out how heroic activists around the world are fighting back.</p><p> This\
  \ is the story of wealth and power in the 21st century. It isn't too late to change\
  \ it.</p>"
