description: "A year ago a boy was found murdered at a girls\u02BC boarding school,\
  \ and the case was never solved. Detective Stephen Moran has been waiting for his\
  \ chance to join Dublin\u2019s Murder Squad when sixteen-year-old Holly Mackey arrives\
  \ in his office with a photo of the boy with the caption: \u201CI KNOW WHO KILLED\
  \ HIM.\u201D Stephen joins with Detective Antoinette Conway to reopen the case\u2014\
  beneath the watchful eye of Holly\u2019s father, fellow detective Frank Mackey.\
  \ With the clues leading back to Holly\u2019s close-knit group of friends, to their\
  \ rival clique, and to the tangle of relationships that bound them all to the murdered\
  \ boy, the private underworld of teenage girls turns out to be more mysterious and\
  \ more dangerous than the detectives imagined."
