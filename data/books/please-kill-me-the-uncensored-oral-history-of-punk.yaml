description: "<div>A <i>Time Out</i> and <i>Daily News</i> Top Ten Book of the Year\
  \ upon its initial release, <i>Please Kill Me</i> is the first oral history of the\
  \ most nihilist of all pop movements. Iggy Pop, Danny Fields, Dee Dee and Joey Ramone,\
  \ Malcom McLaren, Jim Carroll, and scores of other famous and infamous punk figures\
  \ lend their voices to this definitive account of that outrageous, explosive era.\
  \ From its origins in the twilight years of Andy Warhol\xE2\u20AC\u2122s New York\
  \ reign to its last gasps as eighties corporate rock, the phenomenon known as punk\
  \ is scrutinized, eulogized, and idealized by the people who were there and who\
  \ made it happen.<br /></div>"
