description: "<b>Propelled by the same superb instinct for storytelling that made\
  \ <i>The Kite Runner</i> a beloved classic, <i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is at\
  \ once an incredible chronicle of thirty years of Afghan history and a deeply moving\
  \ story of family, friendship, faith, and the salvation to be found in love. </b><br\
  \ /><br />After 103 weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list and with\
  \ four million copies of <i>The Kite Runner</i> shipped, Khaled Hosseini returns\
  \ with a beautiful, riveting, and haunting novel that confirms his place as one\
  \ of the most important literary writers today.<br /><br />Born a generation apart\
  \ and with very different ideas about love and family, Mariam and Laila are two\
  \ women brought jarringly together by war, by loss and by fate. As they endure the\
  \ ever escalating dangers around them-in their home as well as in the streets of\
  \ Kabul-they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and mother-daughter\
  \ to each other, and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own\
  \ lives but of the next generation. With heart-wrenching power and suspense, Hosseini\
  \ shows how a woman's love for her family can move her to shocking and heroic acts\
  \ of self-sacrifice, and that in the end it is love, or even the memory of love,\
  \ that is often the key to survival.A stunning accomplishment, <i>A Thousand Splendid\
  \ Suns</i> is a haunting, heartbreaking, compelling story of an unforgiving time,\
  \ an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love.<br /><br /><b>\n  <br /></b>"
