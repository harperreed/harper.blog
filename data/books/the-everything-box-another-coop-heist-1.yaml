description: "2000 B.C. <br />A beautiful, ambitious angel stands on a mountaintop,\
  \ surveying the world and its little inhabitants below. He smiles because soon,\
  \ the last of humanity who survived the great flood will meet its end, too. And\
  \ he should know. He\u2019s going to play a big part in it. Our angel usually doesn\u2019\
  t get to do field work, and if he does well, he\u2019s certain he\u2019ll be get\
  \ a big promotion. <br />And now it\u2019s time . . .<br />The angel reaches into\
  \ his pocket for the instrument of humanity\u2019s doom. <i>Must be in the other\
  \ pocket.</i> Then he frantically begins to pat himself down. Dejected, he realizes\
  \ he has lost the object. Looking over the Earth at all that could have been, the\
  \ majestic angel utters a single word.<br />\u201CCrap.\u201D<br /><br />2015 <br\
  \ />A thief named Coop-a specialist in purloining magic objects-steals and delivers\
  \ a small box to the mysterious client who engaged his services. Coop doesn\u2019\
  t know that his latest job could be the end of him-and the rest of the world. Suddenly\
  \ he finds himself in the company of the Department of Peculiar Science, a fearsome\
  \ enforcement agency that polices the odd and strange. The box isn\u2019t just a\
  \ supernatural heirloom with quaint powers, they tell him. <br /><br />It\u2019\
  s a doomsday device. They think. . .<br />And suddenly, everyone is out to get it."
