  \ bestselling author of <em>Dark Matter</em> and <em>Recursion</em> </strong><br\
  \ /><br />\u201CYou are the next step in human evolution.\u201D<br /><br />At first,\
  \ Logan Ramsay isn\u2019t sure if anything\u2019s different. He just feels a little\
  \ . . . sharper. Better able to concentrate. Better at multitasking. Reading a bit\

  \ can\u2019t deny Something\u2019s happening to his brain. To his body. He\u2019\

  in whole new ways.<br /><br />The truth is, Logan\u2019s genome has been hacked.\
  \ And there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s been targeted for this upgrade. A reason that\
