description: '<b>The second novel in a new fantasy trilogy by Hugo, Nebula &amp; World
  Fantasy Award nominated author N.K. Jemisin.</b><br /><br /><b>THIS IS THE WAY THE
  WORLD ENDS... FOR THE LAST TIME. </b><br /><br />The season of endings grows darker
  as civilization fades into the long cold night. Alabaster Tenring -- madman, world-crusher,
  savior -- has returned with a mission: to train his successor, Essun, and thus seal
  the fate of the Stillness forever.<br /><br />It continues with a lost daughter,
  found by the enemy.<br /><br />It continues with the obelisks, and an ancient mystery
  converging on answers at last.<br /><br />The Stillness is the wall which stands
  against the flow of tradition, the spark of hope long buried under the thickening
  ashfall. And it will not be broken.<br />'
