description: "<b>What will the next global conflict look like? Find out in this ripping,\
  \ near-futuristic thriller.</b><br /><br /> The United States, China, and Russia\
  \ eye each other across a twenty-first century version of the Cold War, which suddenly\
  \ heats up at sea, on land, in the air, in outer space, and in cyberspace. The fighting\
  \ involves everything from stealthy robotic\u2013drone strikes to old warships from\
  \ the navy\u2019s \u201Cghost fleet.\u201D Fighter pilots unleash a Pearl Harbor\u2013\
  style attack; American veterans become low-tech insurgents; teenage hackers battle\
  \ in digital playgrounds; Silicon Valley billionaires mobilize for cyber-war; and\
  \ a serial killer carries out her own vendetta. Ultimately, victory will depend\
  \ on blending the lessons of the past with the weapons of the future.<br /><br /><i>Ghost\
  \ Fleet</i> is a page-turning speculative thriller in the spirit of <i>The Hunt\
  \ for Red October</i>. The debut novel by two leading experts on the cutting edge\
  \ of national security, it is unique in that every trend and technology featured\
  \ in the novel \u2014 no matter how sci-fi it may seem \u2014 is real, or could\
  \ be soon.<br />\_<br /><br /> \_"
