description: "<i> \u201CIt may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes\
  \ even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime.\" </i><br /><br\
  \ />Amir is the son of a wealthy Kabul merchant, a member of the ruling caste of\
  \ Pashtuns. Hassan, his servant and constant companion, is a Hazara, a despised\
  \ and impoverished caste. Their uncommon bond is torn by Amir's choice to abandon\
  \ his friend amidst the increasing ethnic, religious, and political tensions of\
  \ the dying years of the Afghan monarchy, wrenching them far apart. But so strong\
  \ is the bond between the two boys that Amir journeys back to a distant world, to\
  \ try to right past wrongs against the only true friend he ever had.<br /><br />The\
  \ unforgettable, heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between a wealthy\
  \ boy and the son of his father\u2019s servant, <i>The Kite Runner</i> is a beautifully\
  \ crafted novel set in a country that is in the process of being destroyed. It is\
  \ about the power of reading, the price of betrayal, and the possibility of redemption;\
  \ and an exploration of the power of fathers over sons\u2014their love, their sacrifices,\
  \ their lies.<br /><br />A sweeping story of family, love, and friendship told against\
  \ the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years,\
  \ <i>The Kite Runner</i> is an unusual and powerful novel that has become a beloved,\
  \ one-of-a-kind classic."
