description: "They told David it was impossible\u2014that even the Reckoners had never\
  \ killed a High Epic. Yet, Steelheart\u2014invincible, immortal, unconquerable\u2014\
  is dead. And he died by David\u2019s hand.<br /><br />Eliminating Steelheart was\
  \ supposed to make life more simple. Instead, it only made David realize he has\
  \ questions. Big ones. And there\u2019s no one in Newcago who can give him the answers\
  \ he needs.<br /><br />Babylon Restored, the old borough of Manhattan, has possibilities,\
  \ though. Ruled by the mysterious High Epic, Regalia, David is sure Babylon Restored\
  \ will lead him to what he needs to find. And while entering another city oppressed\
  \ by a High Epic despot is a gamble, David\u2019s willing to risk it. Because killing\
  \ Steelheart left a hole in David\u2019s heart. A hole where his thirst for vengeance\
  \ once lived. Somehow, he filled that hole with another Epic\u2014Firefight. And\
  \ he\u2019s willing to go on a quest darker, and more dangerous even, than the fight\
  \ against Steelheart to find her, and to get his answers."
