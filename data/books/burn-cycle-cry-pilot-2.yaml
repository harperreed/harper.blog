description: "<b>An unbeatable enemy. A planet on the brink. And a squad with a taste\
  \ for revenge.\_</b><br /><br /><b>In this incendiary new military science fiction\
  \ novel, an infantry squad crisscrosses the globe on a search-and-destroy mission\
  \ against a relentless foe.</b><br /><br />After cry pilot Maseo Kaytu's white-knuckled\
  \ victory over the mysterious lampreys at Ayko Base, military command develops new\
  \ weapons and a new strategy. The updated mission is simple: pinpoint the Hatchery,\
  \ the \u201Cspawn point\u201D of the lampreys, and blast it into a fine powder.\
  \ Kaytu's battle-tested squad tracks the enemy from remote bases to elegant cities\
  \ to subterranean caverns, but the lampreys start hitting harder and faster. While\
  \ the squad is winning battles, Earth is losing the war.\_<br /><br />When the search\
  \ for the Hatchery shines a light on Kaytu's insurgent past, he faces a terrible\
  \ truth. There is no line he won't cross to protect his squad. Then a vicious counterattack\
  \ teaches him another lesson: you can't save everyone. In the end, all you can do\
  \ is the job."
