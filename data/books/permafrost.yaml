description: "Fix the past. Save the present. Stop the future. Alastair Reynolds unfolds\
  \ a time-traveling climate fiction adventure in Permafrost.<br /><br />2080: at\
  \ a remote site on the edge of the Arctic Circle, a group of scientists, engineers\
  \ and physicians gather to gamble humanity\u2019s future on one last-ditch experiment.\
  \ Their goal: to make a tiny alteration to the past, averting a global catastrophe\
  \ while at the same time leaving recorded history intact. To make the experiment\
  \ work, they just need one last recruit: an ageing schoolteacher whose late mother\
  \ was the foremost expert on the mathematics of paradox.<br /><br />2028: a young\
  \ woman goes into surgery for routine brain surgery. In the days following her operation,\
  \ she begins to hear another voice in her head... an unwanted presence which seems\
  \ to have a will, and a purpose, all of its own \u2013 one that will disrupt her\
  \ life entirely. The only choice left to her is a simple one.<br /><br />Does she\
  \ resist... or become a collaborator?"
