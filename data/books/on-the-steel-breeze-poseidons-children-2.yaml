description: It is a thousand years in the future. Mankind is making its way out into
  the universe on massive generation ships.<br /><br /><i>On the Steel Breeze</i>
  is the follow-up to <i>Blue Remembered Earth</i>. It is both a sequel and a standalone
  novel, which just happens to be set in the same universe and revolves around members
  of the Akinya family.<br /><br />The central character, Chiku, is totally new, although
  she is closely related to characters in the first book. The action involves a 220-year
  expedition to an extrasolar planet aboard a caravan of huge iceteroid 'holoships',
  the tension between human and artificial intelligence... and, of course, elephants.<br
  /><br />Lots of elephants.
