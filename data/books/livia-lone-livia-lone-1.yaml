description: "<p>Seattle PD sex-crimes detective Livia Lone knows the monsters she\
  \ hunts. Sold by her Thai parents along with her little sister, Nason; marooned\
  \ in America; abused by the men who trafficked them\u2026the only thing that kept\
  \ Livia alive as a teenager was her determination to find Nason.</p><p>Livia has\
  \ never stopped looking. And she copes with her failure to protect her sister by\
  \ doing everything she can to put predators in prison.</p><p>Or, when that fails,\
  \ by putting them in the ground.</p><p>But when a fresh lead offers new hope of\
  \ finding Nason and the men who trafficked them both, Livia will have to go beyond\
  \ just being a cop. Beyond even being a vigilante. She\u2019ll have to relive the\
  \ horrors of the past. Take on one of the most powerful men in the US government.\
  \ And uncover a conspiracy of almost unimaginable evil.</p><p>In every way, it\u2019\
  s an unfair fight. But Livia has two advantages: her unending love for Nason\u2014\
  </p><p>And a lifelong lust for vengeance.</p>"
