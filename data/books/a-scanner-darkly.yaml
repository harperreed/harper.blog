description: Substance D is not known as Death for nothing. It is the most toxic drug
  ever to find its way on to the streets of LA. It destroys the links between the
  brain's two hemispheres, causing, first, disorientation and then complete and irreversible
  brain damage.<br /><br />The undercover narcotics agent who calls himself Bob Arctor
  is desperate to discover the ultimate source of supply. But to find any kind of
  lead he has to pose as a user and, inevitably, without realising what is happening,
  Arctor is soon as addicted as the junkies he works among...
