description: August 1969 San Francisco. Ajax Penumbra seeks a book--the single surviving
  copy of the <i>Techne Tycheon</i>, a mysterious volume that has brought and lost
  great fortune for anyone who has owned it. Late one night, after another day of
  dispiriting dead ends, he stumbles across a 24-hour bookstore, and the possibilities
  before him expand exponentially.
