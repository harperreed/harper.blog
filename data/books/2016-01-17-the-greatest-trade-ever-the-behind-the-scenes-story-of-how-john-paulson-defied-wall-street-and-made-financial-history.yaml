description: "In 2006, hedge fund manager John Paulson realized something few others\
  \ suspected--that the housing market and the value of subprime mortgages were grossly\
  \ inflated and headed for a major fall.\_ Paulson's background was in mergers and\
  \ acquisitions, however, and he knew little about real estate or how to wager against\
  \ housing.\_ He had spent a career as an also-ran on Wall Street. But Paulson was\
  \ convinced this was his chance to make his mark. He just wasn't sure how to do\
  \ it.\_ Colleagues at investment banks scoffed at him and investors dismissed him.\_\
  \ Even pros skeptical about housing shied away from the complicated derivative investments\
  \ that Paulson was just learning about.\_ But Paulson and a handful of renegade\
  \ investors such as Jeffrey Greene and Michael Burry began to bet heavily against\
  \ risky mortgages and precarious financial companies. Timing is everything, though.\
  \ Initially, Paulson and the others lost tens of millions of dollars as real estate\
  \ and stocks continued to soar. Rather than back down, however, Paulson redoubled\
  \ his bets, putting his hedge fund and his reputation on the line.<br />\_\_\_\_\
  \ In the summer of 2007, the markets began to implode, bringing Paulson early profits,\
  \ but also sparking efforts to rescue real estate and derail him. By year's end,\
  \ though, John Paulson had pulled off the greatest trade in financial history, earning\
  \ more than $15 billion for his firm--a figure that dwarfed George Soros's billion-dollar\
  \ currency trade in 1992.\_ Paulson made billions more in 2008 by transforming his\
  \ gutsy move.\_ Some of the underdog investors who attempted the daring trade also\
  \ reaped fortunes. But others who got the timing wrong met devastating failure,\
  \ discovering that being early and right wasn't nearly enough.<br />\_\_\_\_ Written\
  \ by the prizewinning reporter who broke the story in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>,\
  \ <i>The Greatest Trade Ever </i>is a superbly written, fast-paced, behind-the-scenes\
