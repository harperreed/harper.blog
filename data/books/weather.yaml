description: '<b>From the author of the nationwide best seller <i>Dept. of Speculation</i>--one
  of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>''s Ten Best Books of the Year--a shimmering
  tour de force about a family, and a nation, in crisis</b><br /><br />Lizzie Benson
  slid into her job as a librarian without a traditional degree. But this gives her
  a vantage point from which to practice her other calling: she is a fake shrink.
  For years, she has tended to her God-haunted mother and her recovering addict brother.
  They have both stabilized for the moment, but Lizzie has little chance to spend
  her new free time with husband and son before her old mentor, Sylvia Liller, makes
  a proposal. She''s become famous for her prescient podcast, Hell and High Water,
  and wants to hire Lizzie to answer the mail she receives: from left-wingers worried
  about climate change and right wingers worried about the decline of western civilization.
  As Lizzie dives into this polarized world, she begins to wonder what it means to
  keep tending your own garden once you''ve seen the flames beyond its walls. When
  her brother becomes a father and Sylvia a recluse, Lizzie is forced to address the
  limits of her own experience--but still she tries to save everyone, using everything
  she''s learned about empathy and despair, conscience and collusion, from her years
  of wandering the library stacks...And all the while the voices of the city keep
  floating in- funny, disturbing, and increasingly mad.'
