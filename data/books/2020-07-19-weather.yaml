description: "<b>From the author of the nationwide best seller <i>Dept. of Speculation</i>\u2014\
  one of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>'s Ten Best Books of the Year\u2014\
  a shimmering tour de force about a family, and a nation, in crisis</b><br /><br\
  \ />Lizzie Benson slid into her job as a librarian without a traditional degree.\
  \ But this gives her a vantage point from which to practice her other calling: she\
  \ is a fake shrink. For years, she has tended to her God-haunted mother and her\
  \ recovering addict brother. They have both stabilized for the moment, but Lizzie\
  \ has little chance to spend her new free time with husband and son before her old\
  \ mentor, Sylvia Liller, makes a proposal. She's become famous for her prescient\
  \ podcast, Hell and High Water, and wants to hire Lizzie to answer the mail she\
  \ receives: from left-wingers worried about climate change and right wingers worried\
  \ about the decline of western civilization.<br /><br />As Lizzie dives into this\
  \ polarized world, she begins to wonder what it means to keep tending your own garden\
  \ once you've seen the flames beyond its walls. When her brother becomes a father\
  \ and Sylvia a recluse, Lizzie is forced to address the limits of her own experience\u2014\
  but still she tries to save everyone, using everything she's learned about empathy\
  \ and despair, conscience and collusion, from her years of wandering the library\
  \ stacks... And all the while the voices of the city keep floating in\u2014funny,\
  \ disturbing, and increasingly mad."
