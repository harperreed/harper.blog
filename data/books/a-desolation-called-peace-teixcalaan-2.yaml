      description: "\n\n    The action-packed space opera series from Arkady Martine,\
        \ Teixcalaan, blends mystery and adventure on an interstellar scale. \r\n\
        \    \r\n    In the first book,<i> A Memory Called Empire</i>, the new Ambassador\
        \ Mahit Dzmare arrives in the center of the ever-expanding Teixcalaanli Empire\
        \ only to realize that her predecessor's death, occurring at the height of\
        \ political instability, was no accident. Acclimatizing to an alien culture,\
        \ tracking down the murderer of the former ambassador to their small but independent\
        \ mining community, and saving herself from harm's way, makes for a riveting\
        \ debut that will leave readers \"utterly dazzled\" (<i>New York Times Book\
        \ Review</i>).\r\n    \r\n    https://us.macmillan.com/series/teixcalaan\n\
