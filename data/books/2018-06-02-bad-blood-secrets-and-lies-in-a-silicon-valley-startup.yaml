description: '<b>The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse
  of a multibillion-dollar startup, by the prize-winning journalist who first broke
  the story and pursued it to the end in the face of pressure and threats from the
  CEO and her lawyers.</b><br /><br />In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth
  Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose
  startup "unicorn" promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine
  that would make blood tests significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors
  such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round
  that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes''s worth at an estimated $4.7
  billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn''t work.<br /><br />For
  years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees.
  When Carreyrou, working at <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> got a tip from a former
  Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the <i>Journal</i>
  were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens
  of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company''s value was zero
  and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors. Here
  is the riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a disturbing cautionary
  tale set amid the bold promises and gold-rush frenzy of Silicon Valley.'
