description: "One of the quintessential and award-winning novels of the cyberpunk\
  \ genre returns in a striking new edition.<br /><br />India Carless, alias Trouble,\
  \ managed to stay one step ahead of the feds until she retired from life as a hacker\
  \ and settled down to run a small network for an artist\u2019s co-op. Now someone\
  \ has stolen her pseudonym and begun to use it for criminal hacking. So Trouble\
  \ returns. Once the fastest gun on the electronic frontier, she has been called\
  \ out of retirement for one last fight. And it\u2019s a killer.<br /><br />Less\
  \ than a hundred years from now, the forces of law and order crack down on the world\
  \ of the Internet. It is the closing of the frontier. The hip, noir adventurers\
  \ who got by on wit, bravado, and drugs, who haunt the virtual worlds of the shadows\
  \ of cyberspace are up against the edges of civilization. It\u2019s time to adapt\
  \ or die."
