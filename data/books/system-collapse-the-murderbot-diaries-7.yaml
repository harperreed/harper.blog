description: "<b>Everyone's favorite lethal SecUnit is back in the next installment\
  \ in Martha Wells's <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Murderbot Diaries</i> series.</b><br\
  \ /><br /><i>Am I making it worse? I think I'm making it worse.</i><br /><br />Everyone's\
  \ favorite lethal SecUnit is back.<br /><br />Following the events in <i>Network\
  \ Effect</i>, the Barish-Estranza corporation has sent rescue ships to a newly-colonized\
  \ planet in peril, as well as additional SecUnits. But if there\u2019s an ethical\
  \ corporation out there, Murderbot has yet to find it, and if Barish-Estranza can\u2019\
  t have the planet, they\u2019re sure as hell not leaving without <i>something</i>.\
  \ If that something just happens to be an entire colony of humans, well, a free\
  \ workforce is a decent runner-up prize.<br /><br />But there\u2019s something wrong\
  \ with Murderbot; it isn\u2019t running within normal operational parameters. ART\u2019\
  s crew and the humans from Preservation are doing everything they can to protect\
  \ the colonists, but with Barish-Estranza\u2019s SecUnit-heavy persuasion teams,\
  \ they\u2019re going to have to hope Murderbot figures out what\u2019s wrong with\
  \ itself, and fast!<br /><br /><i>Yeah, this plan is... not going to work.</i>"

      description: "\n\n    The Murderbot Diaries, by Martha Wells, is a series concerning\
        \ a violent, self-hacking cyborg searching for the meaning of life. <i>All\
        \ Systems Red</i>, the first book in the series, received the Hugo, Nebula,\
        \ and Locus Awards. It was a <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestseller.\r\
        \n    \r\n    Note the stories are novellas, except for a standalone Murderbot\
        \ novel (Network Effect) and two short stories:\r\n    \r\n    #0.5 \"The\
        \ Future of Work: Compulsory\" <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/future-of-work-compulsory-martha-wells/\"\

        _blank\"<i>Take Us to a Better Place</i></a>\r\n    \r\n    The publication\
        \ order is slightly different from the chronological order. #6, Fugitive Telemetry,\
        \ occurs chronologically before #5, Network Effect, and the short story Compulsory\
        \ (published after #4 Exit Strategy, is the earliest story chronologically).\r\
