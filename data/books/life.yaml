description: '<strong>The long-awaited autobiography of the guitarist, songwriter,
  singer, and founding member of the Rolling Stones. Ladies and gentlemen: Keith Richards.</strong><br
  /><br />With The Rolling Stones, Keith Richards created the songs that roused the
  world, and he lived the original rock and roll life.<br /><br />Now, at last, the
  man himself tells his story of life in the crossfire hurricane. Listening obsessively
  to Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records, learning guitar and forming a band with
  Mick Jagger and Brian Jones. The Rolling Stones''s first fame and the notorious
  drug busts that led to his enduring image as an outlaw folk hero. Creating immortal
  riffs like the ones in "Jumping Jack Flash" and "Honky Tonk Women." His relationship
  with Anita Pallenberg and the death of Brian Jones. Tax exile in France, wildfire
  tours of the U.S., isolation and addiction. Falling in love with Patti Hansen. Estrangement
  from Jagger and subsequent reconciliation. Marriage, family, solo albums and Xpensive
  Winos, and the road that goes on forever.<br /><br />With his trademark disarming
  honesty, Keith Richard brings us the story of a life we have all longed to know
  more of, unfettered, fearless, and true.'
