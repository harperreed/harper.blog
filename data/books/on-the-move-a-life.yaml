description: "<b>An impassioned, tender, and joyous memoir by the author of <i>Musicophilia</i>\
  \ and <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i>.</b>\_<br /><br />When Oliver\
  \ Sacks was twelve years old, a perceptive schoolmaster wrote in his report: \"\
  Sacks will go far, if he does not go too far.\" It is now abundantly clear that\
  \ Sacks has never stopped going. From its opening pages on his youthful obsession\
  \ with motorcycles and speed, <i>On the Move</i> is infused with his restless energy.\
  \ As he recounts his experiences as a young neurologist in the early 1960s, first\
  \ in California, where he struggled with drug addiction and then in New York, where\
  \ he discovered a long-forgotten illness in the back wards of a chronic hospital,\
  \ we see how his engagement with patients comes to define his life.<br /><br />With\
  \ unbridled honesty and humor, Sacks shows us that the same energy that drives his\
  \ physical passions--weight lifting and swimming--also drives his cerebral passions.\
  \ He writes about his love affairs, both romantic and intellectual; his guilt over\
  \ leaving his family to come to America; his bond with his schizophrenic brother;\
  \ and the writers and scientists--Thom Gunn, A. R. Luria, W. H. Auden, Gerald M.\
  \ Edelman,\_Francis Crick--who influenced him. <i>On the Move</i> is the story of\
  \ a brilliantly unconventional physician and writer--and of the man who has illuminated\
  \ the many ways that the brain makes us human."
