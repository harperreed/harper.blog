description: "<i>The Traitor Baru Cormorant</i> is an epic geopolitical fantasy about\
  \ one woman's mission to tear down an empire by learning how to rule it.<br /><br\
  \ />Tomorrow, on the beach, Baru Cormorant will look up from the sand of her home\
  \ and see red sails on the horizon.<br /><br />The Empire of Masks is coming, armed\
  \ with coin and ink, doctrine and compass, soap and lies. They'll conquer Baru\u2019\
  s island, rewrite her culture, criminalize her customs, and dispose of one of her\
  \ fathers. But Baru is patient. She'll swallow her hate, prove her talent, and join\
  \ the Masquerade. She will learn the secrets of empire. She\u2019ll be exactly what\
  \ they need. And she'll claw her way high enough up the rungs of power to set her\
  \ people free.<br /><br />In a final test of her loyalty, the Masquerade will send\
  \ Baru to bring order to distant Aurdwynn, a snakepit of rebels, informants, and\
  \ seditious dukes. Aurdwynn kills everyone who tries to rule it. To survive, Baru\
  \ will need to untangle this land\u2019s intricate web of treachery - and conceal\
  \ her attraction to the dangerously fascinating Duchess Tain Hu.<br /><br />But\
  \ Baru is a savant in games of power, as ruthless in her tactics as she is fixated\
  \ on her goals. In the calculus of her schemes, all ledgers must be balanced, and\
  \ the price of liberation paid in full."
