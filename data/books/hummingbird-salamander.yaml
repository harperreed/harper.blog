description: "From the author of <em>Annihilation</em>, a brilliant speculative thriller\
  \ of dark conspiracy, endangered species, and the possible end of all things.<br\
  \ /><br />Security consultant \u201CJane Smith\u201D receives an envelope with a\
  \ key to a storage unit that holds a taxidermied hummingbird and clues leading her\
  \ to a taxidermied salamander. Silvina, the dead woman who left the note, is a reputed\
  \ ecoterrorist and the daughter of an Argentine industrialist. By taking the hummingbird\
  \ from the storage unit, Jane sets in motion a series of events that quickly spin\
  \ beyond her control.<br /><br />Soon, Jane and her family are in danger, with few\
  \ allies to help her make sense of the true scope of the peril. Is the only way\
  \ to safety to follow in Silvina\u2019s footsteps? Is it too late to stop? As she\
  \ desperately seeks answers about why Silvina contacted her, time is running out\u2014\
  for her and possibly for the world.<br /><br /><em>Hummingbird Salamander</em> is\
  \ Jeff VanderMeer at his brilliant, cinematic best, wrapping profound questions\
  \ about climate change, identity, and the world we live in into a tightly plotted\
  \ thriller full of unexpected twists and elaborate conspiracy."
