description: 'Why hack computers when you can hack nature? Sterling''s Storm Troupe
  lives in a post-greenhouse world ravaged by monster storms and finds itself hacking
  the ultimate storm: the F-6 tornado. No one in the Troupe, not even it''s brilliant,
  driven leader, guesses the real nature of the F-6 or the shadowy forces unleashed
  in its twisting fury. Not until it is too late...'
