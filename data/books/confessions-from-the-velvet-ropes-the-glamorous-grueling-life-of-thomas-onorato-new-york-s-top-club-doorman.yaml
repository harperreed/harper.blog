description: 'New York''s top doorman, Thomas Onorato, raises the ropes and gives
  readers a sneak peak into some of the world''s most exclusive parties.<br /><br
  />"If you are not on the guest list or if I don''t know you or if I don''t like
  you, you are NOT GETTING INTO THIS PARTY!"<br />The doorman. The gatekeeper of the
  night. These silent observers see it all and yet say nothing. Until now. In <i>Confessions
  from the Velvet Ropes, </i>New York''s top club doorman, Thomas Onorato, lifts the
  ropes and lets ordinary readers into this exciting world. The book is an entertaining
  and hilarious collection of tales from the worlds of nightlife, fashion shows and
  celebrity parties. Highlights include: The night Madonna DJed at an intimate downtown
  club, Courtney Love''s surprise concert that ended in her arrest, the crazed stalker
  who attacked Pulp''s Jarvis Cocker, the aerial attack on Adrien Brody''s birthday
  party, Diddy''s surprise appearance at an electro-punk event and more. Onorato was
  always on hand and brings his insider info and nightlife wisdom to readers of <i>Confessions
  from the Velvet Ropes. </i>Combining elements of juicy gossip columns, rock star
  fan memoirs and nightlife social studies, <i>Confessions from the Velvet Ropes </i>is
  a tell-all with style, including humorous side-bars and tips on how readers might
  make it past the velvet ropes.<br /><br />'
