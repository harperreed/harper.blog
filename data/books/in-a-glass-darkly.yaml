description: 'This remarkable collection of stories, first published in 1872, includes
  <i>Green Tea, The Familiar, Mr. Justice Harbottle, The Room in the Dragon Volant</i>,
  and <i>Carmilla</i>. The five stories are purported to be cases by Dr. Hesselius,
  a ''metaphysical'' doctor, who is willing to consider the ghosts both as real and
  as hallucinatory obsessions. The reader''s doubtful anxiety mimics that of the protagonist,
  and each story thus creates that atmosphere of mystery which is the supernatural
  experience. This new annotated edition includes an introduction, notes on the text,
  and explanatory notes.<br /><br />NB: <i>The Familiar</i> is a revision of <i>The
  Watcher</i>; <i>Mr. Justice Harbottle</i> is a revision of <i>An Account of Some
  Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street</i>.'
