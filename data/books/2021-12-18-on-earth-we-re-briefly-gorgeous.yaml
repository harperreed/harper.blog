description: "<strong>Named one of the most anticipated books of 2019 by <em>Vulture</em>,\

  \ /><br />Poet Ocean Vuong\u2019s debut novel is a shattering portrait of a family,\
  \ a first love, and the redemptive power of storytelling</strong><br /><br /><em>On\
  \ Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous</em> is a letter from a son to a mother who\
  \ cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the\
  \ letter unearths a family\u2019s history that began before he was born \u2014 a\
  \ history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam \u2014 and serves as a doorway into\
  \ parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable\
  \ revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single\
  \ mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and\
  \ masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are\
  \ in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness,\
  \ <em>On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous</em> is as much about the power of telling\
  \ one\u2019s own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.\
  \ <br /><br />With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught\
  \ between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without\
  \ forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a\
  \ kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years."
