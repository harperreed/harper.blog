description: "Zack Lightman has spent his life dreaming. Dreaming that the real world\
  \ could be a little more like the countless science-fiction books, movies, and videogames\
  \ he\u2019s spent his life consuming. Dreaming that one day, some fantastic, world-altering\
  \ event will shatter the monotony of his humdrum existence and whisk him off on\
  \ some grand space-faring adventure.<br /> <br />But hey, there\u2019s nothing wrong\
  \ with a little escapism, right? After all, Zack tells himself, he knows the difference\
  \ between fantasy and reality. He knows that here in the real world, aimless teenage\
  \ gamers with anger issues don\u2019t get chosen to save the universe.<br /> <br\
  \ />And then he sees the flying saucer.<br /> <br />Even stranger, the alien ship\
  \ he\u2019s staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a\
  \ hugely popular online flight simulator called <i>Armada</i>\u2014in which gamers\
  \ just happen to be protecting the earth from alien invaders. <br /> <br />No, Zack\
  \ hasn\u2019t lost his mind. As impossible as it seems, what he\u2019s seeing is\
  \ all too real. And his skills\u2014as well as those of millions of gamers across\
  \ the world\u2014are going to be needed to save the earth from what\u2019s about\
  \ to befall it.<br /> <br />It\u2019s Zack\u2019s chance, at last, to play the hero.\
  \ But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can\u2019t help thinking back\
  \ to all those science-fiction stories he grew up with, and wondering: Doesn\u2019\
  t something about this scenario seem a little\u2026familiar?<br /> <br />At once\
  \ gleefully embracing and brilliantly subverting science-fiction conventions as\
  \ only Ernest Cline could, <i>Armada</i> is a rollicking, surprising thriller, a\
  \ classic coming of age adventure, and an alien invasion tale like nothing you\u2019\
  ve ever read before\u2014one whose every page is infused with the pop-culture savvy\
  \ that has helped make <i>Ready Player One</i> a phenomenon."
