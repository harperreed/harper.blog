description: "<b><i>Mulan</i> meets <i>The Song of Achilles</i>; an accomplished,\
  \ poetic debut of war and destiny, sweeping across an epic alternate China.</b><br\
  \ /><br />\u201CI refuse to be nothing\u2026\u201D<br /><br />In a famine-stricken\
  \ village on a dusty yellow plain, two children are given two fates. A boy, greatness.\
  \ A girl, nothingness\u2026<br /><br />In 1345, China lies under harsh Mongol rule.\
  \ For the starving peasants of the Central Plains, greatness is something found\
  \ only in stories. When the Zhu family\u2019s eighth-born son, Zhu Chongba, is given\
  \ a fate of greatness, everyone is mystified as to how it will come to pass. The\
  \ fate of nothingness received by the family\u2019s clever and capable second daughter,\
  \ on the other hand, is only as expected.<br /><br />When a bandit attack orphans\
  \ the two children, though, it is Zhu Chongba who succumbs to despair and dies.\
  \ Desperate to escape her own fated death, the girl uses her brother's identity\
  \ to enter a monastery as a young male novice. There, propelled by her burning desire\
  \ to survive, Zhu learns she is capable of doing whatever it takes, no matter how\
  \ callous, to stay hidden from her fate.<br /><br />After her sanctuary is destroyed\
  \ for supporting the rebellion against Mongol rule, Zhu uses takes the chance to\
  \ claim another future altogether: her brother's abandoned greatness."
