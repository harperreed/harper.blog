description: <b>Wunder is gathering in Nevermoor ...</b><br /><br />Morrigan Crow
  may have defeated her deadly curse, passed the dangerous trials and joined the mystical
  Wundrous Society, but her journey into Nevermoor and all its secrets has only just
  begun. And she is fast learning that not all magic is used for good.<br /><br />Morrigan
  Crow has escaped her deadly fate and found a new home in the fantastical city of
  Nevermoor. She has also discovered that she has a strange and magical ability. But
  will her unique talent be a blessing or another curse?<br /><br />Now that Morrigan
  and her best friend Hawthorne are proud scholars in the elite Wundrous Society,
  she is sure that she's found a place to belong at last, but life is far from perfect.
  Can Morrigan prove that she deserves to be in the Society - or will an unexpected
  new enemy ruin her new life?<br /><br /><b>Return to the magical world of Nevermoor!
  Morrigan Crow's perilous adventures continue in the most anticipated sequel of the
  year, a treat for all fans of magic and Wunder.</b>
