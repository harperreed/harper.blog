description: "<b>Brimming with Chambers' signature blend of heart-warming character\
  \ relationships and dazzling adventure,\_<em>Record of a Spaceborn</em> few is the\
  \ third standalone installment of the <em>Wayfarers</em> series, set\_in the sprawling\
  \ universe of the Galactic Commons,\_and following\_a new motley crew on a journey\
  \ to another corner corner of the cosmos\u2014one often mentioned, but not yet explored.</b><p>Return\
  \ to the sprawling universe of the Galactic Commons, as humans, artificial intelligence,\
  \ aliens, and some beings yet undiscovered explore what it means to be a community\
  \ in this exciting third adventure in the acclaimed and multi-award-nominated science\
  \ fiction Wayfarers series, brimming with heartwarming characters and dazzling space\
  \ adventure.</p><p>Hundreds of years ago, the last humans on Earth boarded the Exodus\
  \ Fleet in search of a new home among the stars. After centuries spent wandering\
  \ empty space, their descendants were eventually accepted by the well-established\
  \ species that govern the Milky Way.</p><p>But that was long ago. Today, the Exodus\
  \ Fleet is a living relic, the birthplace of many, yet a place few outsiders have\
  \ ever visited. While the Exodans take great pride in their original community and\
  \ traditions, their culture has been influenced by others beyond their bulkheads.\
  \ As many Exodans leave for alien cities or terrestrial colonies, those who remain\
  \ are left to ponder their own lives and futures: What is the purpose of a ship\
  \ that has reached its destination? Why remain in space when there are habitable\
  \ worlds available to live? What is the price of sustaining their carefully balanced\
  \ way of life\u2014and is it worth saving at all?</p><p>A young apprentice, a lifelong\
  \ spacer with young children, a planet-raised traveler, an alien academic, a caretaker\
  \ for the dead, and an Archivist whose mission is to ensure no one\u2019s story\
  \ is forgotten, wrestle with these profound universal questions. The answers may\
  \ seem small on the galactic scale, but to these individuals, it could mean everything.</p>"
