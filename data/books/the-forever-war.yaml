description: "<b>Series Info:</b><br />This is the first part of the \"Forever War\"\
  \ series, however it can be read as a standalone.<br /><br /><b>Book Description:</b><br\
  \ />The Earth's leaders have drawn a line in the interstellar sand\u2014despite\
  \ the fact that the fierce alien enemy that they would oppose is inscrutable, unconquerable,\
  \ and very far away. A reluctant conscript drafted into an elite Military unit,\
  \ Private William Mandella has been propelled through space and time to fight in\
  \ the distant thousand-year conflict; to perform his duties and do whatever it takes\
  \ to survive the ordeal and return home. But \"home\" may be even more terrifying\
  \ than battle, because, thanks to the time dilation caused by space travel, Mandella\
  \ is aging months while the Earth he left behind is aging centuries."
