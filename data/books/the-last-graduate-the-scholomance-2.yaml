description: "<b>The specter of graduation looms large as Naomi Novik\u2019s trilogy\
  \ continues in the sequel to <i>A Deadly Education</i>.</b><br /><br /><i>In Wisdom,\
  \ Shelter</i>. That\u2019s the official motto of the Scholomance. I suppose you\
  \ could even argue that it\u2019s true\u2014only the wisdom is hard to come by,\
  \ so the shelter\u2019s rather scant. <br /> <br />Our beloved school does its best\
  \ to devour all its students\u2014but now that I\u2019ve reached my senior year\
  \ and have actually won myself a handful of allies, it\u2019s suddenly developed\
  \ a very particular craving for me. And even if I somehow make it through the endless\
  \ waves of maleficaria that it keeps throwing at me in between grueling homework\
  \ assignments, I haven\u2019t any idea how my allies and I are going to make it\
  \ through the graduation hall alive. <br /> <br />Unless, of course, I finally accept\
  \ my foretold destiny of dark sorcery and destruction. That would certainly let\
  \ me sail straight out of here. The course of wisdom, surely.<br /> <br />But I\u2019\
  m not giving in\u2014not to the mals, not to fate, and especially not to the Scholomance.\
  \ I\u2019m going to get myself and my friends out of this hideous place for good\u2014\
  even if it\u2019s the last thing I do."
