description: '<b>Catherynne M. Valente, the bestselling and award-winning creator
  of <i>Space Opera</i> and <i>The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland</i> returns
  with <i>The Past is Red</i>, the enchanting, dark, funny, angry story of a girl
  who made two terrible mistakes: she told the truth and she dared to love the world.<br
  /></b><br />The future is blue. Endless blue...except for a few small places that
  float across the hot, drowned world left behind by long-gone fossil fuel-guzzlers.
  One of those patches is a magical place called Garbagetown.<br /><br />Tetley Abednego
  is the most beloved girl in Garbagetown, but she''s the only one who knows it. She''s
  the only one who knows a lot of things: that Garbagetown is the most wonderful place
  in the world, that it''s full of hope, that you can love someone and 66% hate them
  all at the same time.<br /><br />But Earth is a terrible mess, hope is a fragile
  thing, and a lot of people are very angry with her. Then Tetley discovers a new
  friend, a terrible secret, and more to her world than she ever expected.'
