description: "<i>Against the backdrop of a totalitarian </i><i>North Korea</i><i>,\
  \ one man unwillingly uncovers the truth behind series of murders, and wagers his\
  \ life in the process.</i><i></i><br /><i>Sit on a quiet hillside at dawn among\
  \ the wildflowers; take a picture of a car coming up a deserted highway from the\
  \ south</i>. Simple orders for Inspector O, until he realizes they have led him\
  \ far, far off his department's turf and into a maelstrom of betrayal and death.\
  \ North Korea's leaders are desperate to hunt down and eliminate anyone who knows\
  \ too much about a series of decades-old kidnappings and murders--and Inspector\
  \ O discovers too late he has been sent into the chaos.<br />This is a world where\
  \ nothing works as it should, where the crimes of the past haunt the present, and\
  \ where even the shadows are real. A corpse in Pyongyang's main hotel---the Koryo---pulls\
  \ Inspector O into a confrontation of bad choices between the devils he knows and\
  \ those he doesn't want to meet. A blue button on the floor of a hotel closet, an\
  \ ice blue Finnish lake, and desperate efforts by the North Korean leadership set\
  \ Inspector O on a journey to the edge of a reality he almost can't survive. <br\
  \ />Like Philip Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy and the Inspector Arkady Renko novels,\
  \ <i>A Corpse in the Koryo</i> introduces another unfamiliar world, a perplexing\
  \ universe seemingly so alien that the rules are an enigma to the reader and even,\
  \ sometimes, to Inspector O. Author James Church weaves a story with beautifully\
  \ spare prose and layered descriptions of a country and a people he knows by heart\
  \ after decades as an intelligence officer. This is a chilling portrayal that, in\
  \ the end, leaves us wondering if what at first seemed unknowable may simply be\
  \ too familiar for comfort.\_Critical Acclaim for <i>The Corpse in the Koryo</i><br\
  \ />\_<br />\"This is a fine, intelligent, and exciting story that takes us into\
  \ the netherworld of contemporary North Korean communism. It evokes the gray milieu\
  \ without ever overstepping its mark, allowing us to see it from the inside rather\
  \ than the outside, wherein the humanity of all the characters, both good and evil,\
  \ is apparent. Inspector O is a particularly wonderful creation, a true mensch attempting\
  \ to hold on to his humanity in a world where humanism is under constant attack.\
  \ Subtlety is the method, and the result is fantastic work that should mark the\
  \ beginning of a brilliant career for James Church.\" <br />---Olen Steinhauer,\
  \ author of <i>Liberation Movements</i><br />\_<br />\"For over fifty years Americans\
  \ have tried to understand the world of North Korea. James Church does a better\
  \ job of describing the isolated, impoverished, corrupt, and out- of-touch life\
  \ in the North than anything I have seen. This novel is a must-read for anyone who\
  \ would understand how precarious the dictatorship is.\"<br />---Newt Gingrich,\
  \ author of <i>Winning Back the Future</i> and <i>Never Call Retreat</i><br />\_\
  <br />\"A gripping story of mystery and intrigue. The laconic Inspector O follows\
  \ in the traditions of Inspector Arkady Renko, operating in a world of complexity\
  \ and danger we're meeting here for the first time.\" <br />---Don Oberdorfer, author\
  \ of <i>Tet!</i> <br /><br />\"Church's debut thriller breaks new ground. O is an\
  \ original. This is an expert take on a complex, brutal, and mystifying society.\
  \ Immerse yourself in it.\" <br />---Marshall Browne, author of <i>Eye of the Abyss</i>\
  \ and the Inspector Anders series <br />\_<br />\"<i>The Corpse in the Koryo</i>\
  \ is a spellbinder. Bloody and chilling, yet subtle in its psychological detail,\
  \ with an amazing understanding of North Korea.\" <br />---Ezra F. Vogel, Henry\
  \ Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences, Harvard University Asia Center<br />\_\
  <br />\"The (pseudonymous) author, a veteran intelligence officer, has intimate\
  \ knowledge of Asian life and politics, and it shows: He gives the North Korea setting\
  \ a feeling of palpable reality, depicting the nature of daily life under a totalitarian\
  \ government not just with broad sociopolitical descriptions but also with specific\
  \ everyday details. . . . There is also a little of Martin Cruz Smith's early Arkady\
  \ Renko novels here. The writing is superb, too, well above the level usually associated\
  \ with a first novel, richly layered and visually evocative.\" <br /><i>---Booklist</i>\
