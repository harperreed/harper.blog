description: "<b>An exhilarating, thoughtful, and beautifully written debut memoir\
  \ by musician, songwriter, and lead singer-lyricist of Grammy award-winning metal\
  \ band, System Of A Down, Serj Tankian</b> \_ Serj Tankian will be the first to\
  \ admit that his band, System Of A Down, was \u201Cunlikely a chart-topper as had\
  \ ever existed in modern music a band of Armenian-Americans playing a practically\
  \ unclassifiable clash of wildly aggressive metal riffs, unconventional tempo-twisting\
  \ rhythms, and Armenian folk melodies, with me alternately growling, screaming,\
  \ and crooning lyrics that could pivot from avant-garde silliness to raging socio-political\
  \ rants in the space of a single line.\u201D After all, as Serj concedes, \u201C\
  it\u2019s not easy listening.\u201D \_ Even so, there\u2019s no doubt that System\u2019\
  s music had struck a chord with millions of listeners across the globe ever since\
  \ they burst on the scene in the mid-1990s. With nearly 40 million album sales,\
  \ three albums topping the Billboard charts, and a devoted legion of fans, the band\
  \ dominated the alt-rock and metal scenes just as the world hurtled into a new millennium,\
  \ redefining the very idea of what rockstars could and couldn\u2019t talk about,\
  \ could and couldn\u2019t do, could and couldn\u2019t represent.\_ \_ In\_DOWN WITH\
  \ THE SYSTEM,\_Serj presents readers with a memoir that is far more than just a\_\
  rock 'n' roll fable. It's an immigrant's tale, it\u2019s an activist's awakening,\
  \ and it's a spiritual journey from darkness toward light. And all of this comes\
  \ down to the fact that Serj himself has had the chance to live an extraordinary\
  \ life\u2014thanks to a combination of luck, circumstance, struggle, talent, and\
  \ spiritual awakening. Born to Armenian parents in Beirut, Serj grows up hearing\
  \ bombs drop outside his childhood home during the country\u2019s civil war, before\
  \ moving to Los Angeles at the age of seven. As a young man, he is immersed in the\
  \ SoCal community of \u201CLittle Armenia,\u201D learning more and more about the\
  \ brutal genocide faced by his ancestors while helping his parents adapt to the\
  \ constraints and contradictions of the American Dream. Then, during a pivotal drive\
  \ home from an LSAT class, Serj decides to turn away from a promising future in\
  \ business and law to make music instead\u2014a decision that leads him to touring\
  \ five continents as the lead singer of a hugely popular rock band, hitting number\
  \ #1 on the Billboard album charts the morning of 9/11, and then having the hit\
  \ single from the same album banned from radio two days later. In the years that\
  \ follow, his uniquely singular story continues, as he\_evades glass bottles hurled\
  \ at a cancelled show by angry Slayer fans, teams up with Tom Morello to push social\
  \ justice causes on unsuspecting metalheads, argues with LAPD officers over the\
  \ best way to quell rioting fans, and defines new sounds and singing tactics with\
  \ Rick Rubin.\_ \_ Braiding together Serj\u2019s thought-provoking insight with\
  \ heartfelt and poetic prose,\_DOWN WITH THE SYSTEM retraces\_Serj\u2019s remarkable\
  \ and unlikely journey, and explores what it\u2019s taught him\u2014about music,\
  \ about art, about activism, and about himself. It\u2019s an unforgettable ride\
  \ that will leave you breathless\u2014and an absolute delight for new fans and old\
  \ ones alike.\_"
