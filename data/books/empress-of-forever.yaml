description: "A feminist Guardians of the Galaxy\u2014a smart, swashbuckling, wildly\
  \ imaginative adventure of a rag-tag team of brilliant misfits, dangerous renegades,\
  \ and enhanced outlaws in a war-torn future.<br /><br />A wildly successful innovator\
  \ to rival Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, Vivian Liao is prone to radical thinking, quick\
  \ decision-making, and reckless action. On the eve of her greatest achievement,\
  \ she's trying to outrun those who are trying to steal her success.<br /><br />In\
  \ the chilly darkness of a Boston server farm, Viv sets her ultimate plan into motion.\
  \ A terrifying instant later, Vivian Liao is catapulted through space and time to\
  \ a far future where she confronts a destiny stranger and more deadly than she could\
  \ ever imagine. <br /><br />The end of time is ruled by an ancient, powerful Empress\
  \ who blesses or blasts entire planets with a single thought. Rebellion is literally\
  \ impossible to consider--until Vivian arrives. Trapped between the Pride, a ravening\
  \ horde of sentient machines, and a fanatical sect of warrior monks who call themselves\
  \ the Mirrorfaith, Viv must rally a strange group of allies to confront the Empress\
  \ and find a way back to the world and life she left behind.<br /><br />A magnificent\
  \ work of vivid imagination and universe-spanning action, Empress of Forever is\
  \ a feminist Guardians of the Galaxy crossed with Star Wars and spiced with the\
  \ sensibility and spirit of Iain M. Banks and William Gibson."
