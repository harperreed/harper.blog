description: 'Great Britain circa 1985: time travel is routine, cloning is a reality
  (dodos are the resurrected pet of choice), and literature is taken very, very seriously.
  Baconians are trying to convince the world that Francis Bacon really wrote Shakespeare,
  there are riots between the Surrealists and Impressionists, and thousands of men
  are named John Milton, an homage to the real Milton and a very confusing situation
  for the police. Amidst all this, Acheron Hades, Third Most Wanted Man In the World,
  steals the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit and kills a minor character,
  who then disappears from every volume of the novel ever printed! But that''s just
  a prelude . . .<br /><br />Hades'' real target is the beloved Jane Eyre, and it''s
  not long before he plucks her from the pages of Bronte''s novel. Enter Thursday
  Next. She''s the Special Operative''s renowned literary detective, and she drives
  a Porsche. With the help of her uncle Mycroft''s Prose Portal, Thursday enters the
  novel to rescue Jane Eyre from this heinous act of literary homicide. It''s tricky
  business, all these interlopers running about Thornfield, and deceptions run rampant
  as their paths cross with Jane, Rochester, and Miss Fairfax. Can Thursday save Jane
  Eyre and Bronte''s masterpiece? And what of the Crimean War? Will it ever end? And
  what about those annoying black holes that pop up now and again, sucking things
  into time-space voids . . .<br /><br />Suspenseful and outlandish, absorbing and
  fun, The Eyre Affair is a caper unlike any other and an introduction to the imagination
  of a most distinctive writer and his singular fictional universe.'
