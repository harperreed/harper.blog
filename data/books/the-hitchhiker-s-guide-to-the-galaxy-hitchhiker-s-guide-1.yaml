description: '<i>An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7799247-the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy"
  rel="nofollow">here</a></i><br /><br />Seconds before the Earth is demolished to
  make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend
  Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker''s Guide to
  the Galaxy who, for the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor.<br
  /><br />Together this dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes
  from The Hitchhiker''s Guide ("A towel is about the most massively useful thing
  an interstellar hitchhiker can have") and a galaxy-full of fellow travelers: Zaphod
  Beeblebrox--the two-headed, three-armed ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president
  of the galaxy; Trillian, Zaphod''s girlfriend (formally Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur
  tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid,
  brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student
  who is obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens he bought over
  the years.<br /><br />Where are these pens? Why are we born? Why do we die? Why
  do we spend so much time between wearing digital watches? For all the answers stick
  your thumb to the stars. And don''t forget to bring a towel!'
