description: '<b>From #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Brandon Sanderson,
  <i>The Way of Kings</i>, Book One of the Stormlight Archive begins an incredible
  new saga of epic proportion.</b><br /><br />Roshar is a world of stone and storms.
  Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently
  that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees
  pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built
  only where the topography offers shelter.<br /><br />It has been centuries since
  the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades
  and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary
  men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were
  fought for them, and won by them.<br /><br />One such war rages on a ruined landscape
  called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship
  for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war
  that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he
  struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<br
  /><br />Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother,
  the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called <i>The Way of Kings</i>.
  Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has
  begun to doubt his own sanity.<br /><br />Across the ocean, an untried young woman
  named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar''s
  niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan''s motives are less
  than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets
  of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<br /><br />The result of over
  ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings</i> is but
  the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<br
  /><br />Speak again the ancient oaths:<br /><br /><b>Life before death.</b><br /><b></b><b>Strength
  before weakness.</b><br /><b></b><b>Journey before Destination.</b><br /><b></b><br
  /><b></b>and return to men the Shards they once bore.<br /><br />The Knights Radiant

        \ across the rocky terrain. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten\
        \ consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and\
        \ Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary\
        \ men into near-invincible warriors. As brutal wars rage over the control\
        \ of these magical weapons, an ancient text called The Way of Kings tells\
        \ of ancient times, the Knights Radiant, and perhaps the true cause of the\
        \ war. The Knights Radiant must stand again.\n    \n    https://us.macmillan.com/series/thestormlightarchive\n\
