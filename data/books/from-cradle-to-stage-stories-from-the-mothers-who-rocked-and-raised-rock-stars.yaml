description: "While the Grohl family had always been musical\u2014the family sang\
  \ together on long car trips, harmonizing to Motown and David Bowie\u2014Virginia\
  \ never expected her son to become a musician, let alone a rock star. But when she\
  \ saw him perform in front of thousands of screaming fans for the first time, she\
  \ knew that rock stardom was meant to be for her son. And as Virginia watched her\
  \ son's star rise, she often wondered about the other mothers who raised sons and\
  \ daughters who became rock stars. Were they as surprised as she was about their\
  \ children's fame? Did they worry about their children's livelihood and wellbeing\
  \ in an industry fraught with drugs and other dangers? Did they encourage their\
  \ children's passions despite the odds against success, or attempt to dissuade them\
  \ from their grandiose dreams? Do they remind their kids to pack a warm coat when\
  \ they go on tour?<br /><br />Virginia decided to seek out other rock star mothers\
  \ to ask these questions, and so began a two-year odyssey in which she interviewed\
  \ such women as Verna Griffin, Dr. Dre's mother; Marianne Stipe, Michael Stipe of\
  \ REM's mother; Janis Winehouse, Amy Winehouse's mother; Patsy Noah, Adam Levine's\
  \ mother; Donna Haim, mother of the Haim sisters; Hester Diamond, Mike D of The\
  \ Beastie Boys' mother. <br /><br />With exclusive family photographs and a foreword\
  \ by Dave Grohl, <em>From Cradle to Stage</em> will appeal to mothers and rock fans\
  \ everywhere."
