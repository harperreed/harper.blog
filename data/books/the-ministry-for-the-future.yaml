description: <i>The Ministry for the Future </i>is a masterpiece of the imagination,
  using fictional eyewitness accounts to tell the story of how climate change will
  affect us all. Its setting is not a desolate, postapocalyptic world, but a future
  that is almost upon us. Chosen by Barack Obama as one of his favorite books of the
  year, this extraordinary novel from visionary science fiction writer Kim Stanley
  Robinson will change the way you think about the climate crisis.
