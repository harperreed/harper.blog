description: "<i>Keep your eyes peeled for a small black iron door.</i><br /><br />Down\
  \ the road from a working-class British pub, along the brick wall of a narrow alley,\
  \ if the conditions are exactly right, you\u2019ll find the entrance to <i>Slade\
  \ House</i>. A stranger will greet you by name and invite you inside. At first,\
  \ you won\u2019t want to leave. Later, you\u2019ll find that you can\u2019t. Every\
  \ nine years, the house\u2019s residents\u2014an odd brother and sister\u2014extend\
  \ a unique invitation to someone who\u2019s different or lonely: a precocious teenager,\
  \ a recently divorced policeman, a shy college student. But what really goes on\
  \ inside <i>Slade House</i>? For those who find out, it\u2019s already too late.\
  \ . . .<br /><br />Spanning five decades, from the last days of the 1970s to the\
  \ present, leaping genres, and barreling toward an astonishing conclusion, this\
  \ intricately woven novel will pull you into a reality-warping new vision of the\
  \ haunted house story\u2014as only David Mitchell could imagine it."
