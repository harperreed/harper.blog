description: Right from the start, Bigger Thomas had been headed for jail. It could
  have been for assault or petty larceny; by chance, it was for murder and rape. <i>Native
  Son</i> tells the story of this young black man caught in a downward spiral after
  he kills a young white woman in a brief moment of panic.<br /><br />Set in Chicago
  in the 1930s, Wright's powerful novel is an unsparing reflection on the poverty
  and feelings of hopelessness experienced by people in inner cities across the country
  and of what it means to be black in America.
