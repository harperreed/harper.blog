description: 'The mystery of a missing translator sets three lives on a collision
  course that will have a ripple effect across the stars.<br /><br />Qven was created
  to be a Presger translator. The pride of their Clade, they always had a clear path
  before them: learn human ways, and eventually, make a match and serve as an intermediary
  between the dangerous alien Presger and the human worlds. The realization that they
  might want something else isn''t "optimal behavior". I''s the type of behavior that
  results in elimination.<br /><br />But Qven rebels. And in doing so, their path
  collides with those of two others. Enae, a reluctant diplomat whose dead grandmaman
  has left hir an impossible task as an inheritance: hunting down a fugitive who has
  been missing for over 200 years. And Reet, an adopted mechanic who is increasingly
  desperate to learn about his genetic roots--or anything that might explain why he
  operates so differently from those around him.<br /><br />As a Conclave of the various
  species approaches--and the long-standing treaty between the humans and the Presger
  is on the line--the decisions of all three will have ripple effects across the stars.<br
  /><br />Masterfully merging space adventure and mystery, and a poignant exploration
  about relationships and belonging, Translation State is a triumphant new standalone
  story set in Leckie''s celebrated Imperial Radch universe.'
