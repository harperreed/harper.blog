description: Humanity has colonized the solar system - Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid
  Belt and beyond - but the stars are still out of our reach.<br /><br />Jim Holden
  is XO of an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the mining stations
  of the Belt. When he and his crew stumble upon a derelict ship, "The Scopuli," they
  find themselves in possession of a secret they never wanted. A secret that someone
  is willing to kill for - and kill on a scale unfathomable to Jim and his crew. War
  is brewing in the system unless he can find out who left the ship and why.<br /><br
  />Detective Miller is looking for a girl. One girl in a system of billions, but
  her parents have money and money talks. When the trail leads him to "The Scopuli"
  and rebel sympathizer Holden, he realizes that this girl may be the key to everything.<br
  /><br />Holden and Miller must thread the needle between the Earth government, the
  Outer Planet revolutionaries, and secretive corporations - and the odds are against
  them. But out in the Belt, the rules are different, and one small ship can change
  the fate of the universe.

        it to be sure, but I think it might end just before Nemesis Games, which would
        make #4.5 the spot for it. I think the #3.5 ordering is based on the time
        period of the main events of the novella, rather than the time period of the
        last events of the novella. However, I''m leaving it at #5.5 for now, since
        the chronology is unclear and reading it before Nemesis Games is a terrible
        idea.'
