  /><br /><i>Mother Night</i> is a daring challenge to our moral sense. American Howard
  W. Campbell, Jr., a spy during World War II, is now on trial in Israel as a Nazi
  war criminal. But is he really guilty? In this brilliant book rife with true gallows
  humor, Vonnegut turns black and white into a chilling shade of gray with a verdict
  that will haunt us all.'
