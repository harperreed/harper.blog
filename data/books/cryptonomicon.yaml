description: With this extraordinary first volume in what promises to be an epoch-making
  masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and the
  private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the forces that shaped
  this century.<br /><br />In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius
  and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit
  so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people
  have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Waterhouse and Detatchment
  2702 - commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe - is to keep the Nazis ignorant
  of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code.
  It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart,
  translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.<br /><br />Fast-forward
  to the present, where Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting
  to create a "data haven" in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be
  stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals
  attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails grandaughter,
  Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the
  dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy
  with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa.
  And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and
  digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn.<br /><br />A breathtaking
  tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's most accomplished and affecting work to date,
  <i>Cryptonomicon</i> is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it
  leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all
  the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow. It is a work of great art, thought, and
  creative daring; the product of a truly iconoclastic imagination working with white-hot
  intensity.<br /><br />
