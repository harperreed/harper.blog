description: "<b>The searing, post-apocalyptic novel about a father and son\u2019\
  s fight to survive.</b><br /><br />A father and his son walk alone through burned\
  \ America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is\
  \ cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark.\
  \ Their destination is the coast, although they don\u2019t know what, if anything,\
  \ awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against\
  \ the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of\
  \ scavenged food\u2014and each other.<br /><br /><em>The Road</em> is the profoundly\
  \ moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains,\
  \ but in which the father and his son, \u201Ceach the other\u2019s world entire,\u201D\
  \ are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching\
  \ meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness,\
  \ desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face\
  \ of total devastation."
