description: "<b>Alternative Cover Edition can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13568401-a-deepness-in-the-sky\"\
  \ rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. <br /></b><br />After thousands of years searching,\
  \ humans stand on the verge of first contact with an alien race. Two human groups:\
  \ the Qeng Ho, a culture of free traders, and the Emergents, a ruthless society\
  \ based on the technological enslavement of minds.<br /><br />The group that opens\
  \ trade with the aliens will reap unimaginable riches. But first, both groups must\
  \ wait at the aliens' very doorstep for their strange star to relight and for their\
  \ planet to reawaken, as it does every two hundred and fifty years....<br /><br\
  \ />Then, following terrible treachery, the Qeng Ho must fight for their freedom\
  \ and for the lives of the unsuspecting innocents on the planet below, while the\
  \ aliens themselves play a role unsuspected by the Qeng Ho and Emergents alike.<br\
  \ /><br />More than just a great science fiction adventure, <i>A Deepness in the\
  \ Sky </i>is a universal drama of courage, self-discovery, and the redemptive power\
  \ of love.<br /><i></i>\_<br /><br /><i>A Deepness in the Sky</i> is a 1999 Nebula\
  \ Award Nominee for Best Novel and the winner of the 2000 Hugo Award for Best Novel."

      description: "\n\n    Thousands of years from now, a mind's potential is determined\
        \ by its location in space\u2014from superintelligent entities in the Transcend,\
        \ to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures\
        \ and technology can function. Nobody knows what strange force partitioned\
        \ space into these \"regions of thought,\" but when the warring Straumli realm\
        \ use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash\
        \ an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural\
        \ and artificial intelligence.\r\n    \r\n    Vernor Vinge first used the\
        \ concepts of <i>\"Zones of Thought\"</i> in a 1988 novella, <i>\"The Blabber\"\
        </i>, which occurs after Fire. Vinge's novel, <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>,\
        \ is a prequel to <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> set 20,000 years earlier and\
        \ featuring Pham Nuwen. Vinge's <i>Children of the Sky</i> is \"a near-term\
        \ sequel to A Fire Upon the Deep\", set ten years later.\r\n    \r\n    Vinge's\
        \ former wife, Joan D. Vinge, has also written stories in the Zones of Thought\
        \ universe, based on his notes. These include <i>\"The Outcasts of Heaven\
        \ Belt\"</i> and <i>\"Legacy\"</i>.\r\n    \r\n    Vernor Vinge won a Hugo\
        \ Award for <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i>. He also won a Hugo, a John W. Campbell\
        \ and a Prometheus Award for <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>.\r\n    \r\n   \
        \ \r\n    Publication order is as follows:\r\n    \r\n    A Fire Upon the\
        \ Deep\r\n    A Deepness in the Sky\r\n    The Children of the Sky\r\n   \
        \ \r\n    \r\n    Chronological order is:\r\n    \r\n    A Deepness in the\
        \ Sky\r\n    A Fire Upon the Deep\r\n    The Children of the Sky\r\n    \r\
        \n    Some say \"The first book can be read as a stand-alone. Book 3 is the\
        \ continuation of book 1, and has less of the space opera element. Book 2\
        \ can be skipped from the story, or can be read as it's own book. In the timeline\
        \ it is a prequel but it is loosely related to book 1.\"\n\n"
