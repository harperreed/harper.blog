description: "\u201COne night when she was four and sleeping in the bottom bunk of\
  \ her bunk bed, Ruth Cole woke to the sound of lovemaking\u2014it was coming from\
  \ her parents\u2019 bedroom.\u201D<br /><br />This sentence opens John Irving\u2019\
  s ninth novel, A Widow for One Year, a story of a family marked by tragedy. Ruth\
  \ Cole is a complex, often self-contradictory character\u2014a \u201Cdifficult\u201D\
  \ woman. By no means is she conventionally \u201Cnice,\u201D but she will never\
  \ be forgotten.<br /><br />Ruth\u2019s story is told in three parts, each focusing\
  \ on a critical time in her life. When we first meet her\u2014on Long Island, in\
  \ the summer of 1958\u2014Ruth is only four.<br /><br />The second window into Ruth\u2019\
  s life opens on the fall of 1990, when she is an unmarried woman whose personal\
  \ life is not nearly as successful as her literary career. She distrusts her judgment\
  \ in men, for good reason.<br /><br />A Widow for One Year closes in the autumn\
  \ of 1995, when Ruth Cole is a forty-one-year-old widow and mother. She\u2019s about\
  \ to fall in love for the first time.<br /><br />Richly comic, as well as deeply\
  \ disturbing, A Widow for One Year is a multilayered love story of astonishing emotional\
  \ force. Both ribald and erotic, it is also a brilliant novel about the passage\
  \ of time and the relentlessness of grief.<br />Source: john-irving.com"
