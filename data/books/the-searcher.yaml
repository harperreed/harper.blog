description: <b>A spellbinding, propulsive new novel from the bestselling mystery
  writer who "is in a class by herself." (The New York Times)</b><br /><br />Cal Hooper
  thought a fixer-upper in a bucolic Irish village would be the perfect escape. After
  twenty-five years in the Chicago police force and a bruising divorce, he just wants
  to build a new life in a pretty spot with a good pub where nothing much happens.
  But when a local kid whose brother has gone missing arm-twists him into investigating,
  Cal uncovers layers of darkness beneath his picturesque retreat, and starts to realize
  that even small towns shelter dangerous secrets.<br /><br />"One of the greatest
  crime novelists writing today" (Vox) weaves a masterful, atmospheric tale of suspense,
  asking what we sacrifice in our search for truth and justice, and what we risk if
  we don't.
