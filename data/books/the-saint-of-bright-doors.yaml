description: "Nestled at the head of a supercontinent, framed by sky and sea, lies\
  \ Luriat, the city of bright doors. The doors are everywhere in the city, squatting\
  \ in walls where they don\u2019t belong, painted in vivid warning. They watch over\
  \ a city of art and avarice, of plagues and pogroms, and silently refuse to open.\
  \ No one knows what lies beyond them, but everyone has their own theory and their\
  \ own relationship to the doors. Researchers perform tests and take samples, while\
  \ supplicants offer fruit and flowers and hold prayer circles. Many fear the doors\
  \ as the source of hauntings from unspeakable realms. To a rare unchosen few, though,\
  \ the doors are both a calling and a bane. Fetter is one of those few.<br /><br\
  \ />When Fetter was born, his mother tore his shadow from him. She raised him as\
  \ a weapon to kill his sainted father and destroy the religion rising up in his\
  \ sacred footsteps. Now Fetter is unchosen, lapsed in his devotion to both his parents.\
  \ He casts no shadow, is untethered by gravity, and sees devils and antigods everywhere\
  \ he goes. With no path to follow, Fetter would like to be anything but himself.\
  \ Does his answer wait on the other side of one of Luriat\u2019s bright doors?"
