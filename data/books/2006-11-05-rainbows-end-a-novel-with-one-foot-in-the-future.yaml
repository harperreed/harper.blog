description: 'Four time Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge has taken readers to the depths
  of space and into the far future in his bestselling novels <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i>
  and <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>. Now, he has written a science-fiction thriller
  set in a place and time as exciting and strange as any far-future world: San Diego,
  California, 2025.<br /><br />Robert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer''s patient. The
  world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties
  through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers
  that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet.
  Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger,
  and he''s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts . Living
  with his son''s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information
  age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality
  built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice.
  But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old
  granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless access--through nodes designed
  into <i>smart</i> clothes--and to see the digital context--through <i>smart</i>
  contact lenses. <br /><br />With knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train
  at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri
  and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy
  to use technology as a tool for world domination. <br /><br />In a world where every
  computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that
  baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert''s son and
  daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts
  to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot. <br /><br />As Robert
  becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical
  change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide,
  would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to
  join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San
  Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique
  and satisfying as it is unexpected. This is science fiction at its very best, by
  a master storyteller at his peak.<br />'
