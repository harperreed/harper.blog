description: "Machines roam the desert in search of purpose; works of art can be deadlier\
  \ than weapons, and improbable love transcends the sands of time. From the multiaward-winning\
  \ universe of Central Station, a complex desert-city of the future\u2019s inhabitants\
  \ rediscover passion while at the brink of revolution.<br /><br />\u201CCan we just\
  \ all admit now that Lavie Tidhar\u2019s a genius?\u201D<br />\u2014Daryl Gregory,\
  \ award-winning author of Spoonbenders<br /><br />The city known as Neom is many\
  \ things to many beings, human or otherwise. Neom is a tech wonderland for the rich\
  \ and beautiful; an urban sprawl along the Red Sea; and a port of call between Earth\
  \ and the stars.<br /><br />In the desert, young orphan Saleh has joined a caravan,\
  \ hoping to earn his passage off-world from Central Station. But the desert is full\
  \ of mechanical artefacts, some unexplained and some unexploded. Recently, a wry,\
  \ unnamed robot has unearthed one of the region\u2019s biggest mysteries: the vestiges\
  \ of a golden man.<br /><br />In Neom, childhood affection is rekindling between\
  \ loyal shurta-officer Nasir and hardworking flower-seller Mariam. But Nasu, a deadly\
  \ terrorartist, has come to the city with missing memories and unfinished business.<br\
  \ /><br />Just one robot can change a city\u2019s destiny with a single rose\u2014\
  especially when that robot is in search of lost love."
