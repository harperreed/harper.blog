description: "A spectacular new space opera that sees humanity fighting for its survival\
  \ in a war as old as the universe itself.<br /><br />How humanity came to the planet\
  \ called Anjiin is lost in the fog of history, but that history is about to end.\
  \ The Carryx \u2013 part empire, part hive \u2013 have waged wars of conquest for\
  \ centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy. \_Now, they are\
  \ facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may rest with the\
  \ humans of Anjiin. \_ Caught up in academic intrigue and affairs of the heart,\
  \ Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist and his\
  \ celebrated research team. \_Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating the human\
  \ population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away to serve on\
  \ the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them. They are dropped in\
  \ the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition against\
  \ the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure. \_Only Dafyd\
  \ and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the deeper game\
  \ that they must play to learning to understand \u2013 and manipulate \u2013 the\
  \ Carryx themselves. With a noble but suicidal human rebellion on one hand and strange\
  \ and murderous enemies on the other, the team pays a terrible price to become the\
  \ trusted servants of their new rulers. Dafyd Alkhor is a simple man swept up in\
  \ events that are beyond his control and more vast than his imagination. \_He will\
  \ become the champion of humanity and its betrayer, the most hated man in history\
  \ and the guardian of his people. This is where his story begins."
