description: "<b>The last known human searches the galaxy for companionship in a brilliant\
  \ standalone novel from the legendary author of the Pip &amp; Flinx series.</b><br\
  \ /><br /><b>\"A provocative read.\"--<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br /><br />Once\
  \ <i>Homo sapiens</i> reigned supreme, spreading from star system to star system\
  \ in an empire that encountered no alien life and thus knew no enemy . . . save\
  \ itself. As had happened many times before, the basest, most primal human instincts\
  \ rose up, only this time armed with the advanced scientific knowledge to create\
  \ a genetically engineered smart virus that quickly wiped out humanity to the last\
  \ man.<br /><br />That man is Ruslan, the sole known surviving human being in the\
  \ universe. Rescued from the charnel house of his home planet by the Myssari--an\
  \ intelligent alien race--Ruslan spends his days as something of a cross between\
  \ a research subject and a zoo attraction. Though the Myssari are determined to\
  \ resurrect the human race, using Ruslan's genetic material, all he wants for himself\
  \ and his species is oblivion. But then the Myssari make Ruslan an extraordinary\
  \ offer: In exchange for his cooperation, they will do everything in their considerable\
  \ power to find the lost home world of his species--an all-but-mythical place called\
  \ Earth--and, perhaps, another living human.<br /><br />Thus begins an epic journey\
  \ of adventure, danger, heartbreak, and hope, as Ruslan sets out in search of a\
  \ place that may no longer exist--drawn by the slimmest yet most enduring hope.<br\
  \ /><br /><b>Praise for <i>Relic</i></b><br /><br />\"<i>Relic</i> is a thrilling\
  \ and thoughtful epic. With Alan Dean Foster's trademark invention in both the psychology\
  \ and physiology of his aliens, he also enriches the narrative with their complex\
  \ cultures. The plot spans galaxies!\"<b>--Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author\
  \ Greg Bear</b><br /><br />\"The stunning plot of Foster's stand-alone novel will\
  \ intrigue readers for not only the 'last man in the universe' trope but also the\
  \ well-developed alien species. A true first contact novel on many different levels.\"\
  <b>--<i>Library Journal</i></b><br /><br />\"Foster's sympathetic novel successfully\
  \ surveys human frailty, the tendency not to learn from history, and an enduring\
  \ capacity for adaptation and emotional attachment.\"<b>\n  <i>--Publishers Weekly\
  \ </i>\n</b><br /><br />\"Foster's high-concept novel is a gripping tale of serenity\
  \ amid sorrow.\"<b>--World Magazine </b>"
