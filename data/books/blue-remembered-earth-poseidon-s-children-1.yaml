  \ Akinya wants only one thing: to be left in peace, so that he can continue his\
  \ long-running studies into the elephants of the Amboseli basin. But Geoffrey\u2019\
  s family, which controls the vast Akinya business empire, has other plans for him.\
  \ After the death of his grandmother Eunice\u2014the erstwhile space explorer and\
  \ entrepreneur\u2014something awkward has come to light on the Moon, so Geoffrey\
  \ is dispatched there to ensure the family name remains untarnished.<br /><br />But\
  \ the secrets Eunice died with are about to be revealed\u2014secrets that could\
  \ change everything...or tear this near utopia apart."
