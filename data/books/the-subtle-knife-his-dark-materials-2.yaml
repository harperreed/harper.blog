description: "Here is the highly anticipated second installment of Philip Pullman's\
  \ epic fantasy trilogy, begun with the critically acclaimed <i>The Golden Compass</i>.\
  \ Lyra and Will, her newfound friend, tumble separately into the strange tropical\
  \ otherworld of Citt\xE0gazze, \"the city of magpies,\" where adults are curiously\
  \ absent and children run wild. Here their lives become inextricably entwined when\
  \ Lyra's alethiometer gives her a simple command:\_\_find Will's father. Their search\
  \ is plagued with obstacles--some familiar and some horribly new and unfathomable--but\
  \ it eventually brings them closer to Will's father and to the Subtle Knife, a deadly,\
  \ magical, ancient tool that cuts windows between worlds. Through it all, Will and\
  \ Lyra find themselves hurtling toward the center of a fierce battle against a force\
  \ so awesome that leagues of mortals, witches, beasts, and spirits from every world\
  \ are uniting in fear and anger against it. This breathtaking sequel will leave\
  \ readers eager for the third and final volume of <i>His Dark Materials</i>.\_\_"
