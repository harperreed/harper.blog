description: 'Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers
  and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?
  How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent
  crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.<br
  /><br />These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But
  Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies
  the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and
  child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on
  its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question.
  Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly
  freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.<br
  /><br />Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen
  J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people
  get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same
  thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything.
  The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths
  of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets
  of the Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />What unites all these stories is a belief that the
  modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit,
  is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked
  -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking.
  Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see
  through all the clutter.<br /><br />Freakonomics establishes this unconventional
  premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics
  represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will
  be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But
  Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view
  the modern world.<br />(front flap)'
