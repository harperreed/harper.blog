description: "<i>'Not everybody knows how I killed old Phillip Mathers, smashing his\
  \ jaw in with my spade'.</i> So begins <i>\n  <b>The Third Policeman</b>\n</i> -\
  \ straightforward enough you might think until you discover the comic nightmare\
  \ that ensues. After a botched murder, the anti-hero of Flann O'Brien's hilariously\
  \ dark novel finds himself in a surreal world where logic is suspended, a man has\
  \ a love affair with a female bicycle, impressed by 'the simple dignity of her quiet\
  \ way', blindfolded policemen ambush bands of one-legged men, mangles convert light\
  \ into sound, and eternity is balanced by a complex system of levers and clock-like\
  \ dials.<br /><br />But as well as being a rotter and a killer, our hero is also\
  \ something of a scholar, his hero an eccentric polymath called De Selby. Unfolded\
  \ in footnotes, this parallel story gloriously parodies the arcane wrangling between\
  \ academics.<br /><br />'When you are writing about the world of the dead - and\
  \ the damned', Flann O'Brien wrote to a friend after finishing this novel, 'there\
  \ is any amount of scope for back-chat and funny cracks'. At once a thriller, a\
  \ fantastic allegory of the absurd and a brilliant satire on time and reality, guilt,\
  \ damnation and death, <i>\n  <b>The Third Policeman</b>\n</i> reveals his unique\
  \ genius. Yet, it is a curiosity worthy of O'Brien himself that the comic masterpiece\
  \ of an author now recognised, along with Joyce and Beckett, as one of the greats\
  \ of Irish literature, was rejected by his publisher and lay unheeded on a sideboard\
  \ for twenty-seven years. But then, as O'Brien himself tells us, when it comes to\
  \ life, there is <i>'nothing so dangerous, you can't smoke it, nobody will give\
  \ you tuppence-halfpenny for the half of it and it kills you in the wind up'.</i>"
