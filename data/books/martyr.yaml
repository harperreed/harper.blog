description: "<b>Kaveh Akbar\u2019s <i>Martyr!</i> is a paean to how we spend our\
  \ lives seeking meaning\u2014in faith, art, ourselves, others\u2014in which a newly\
  \ sober, orphaned son of Iranian immigrants, guided by the voices of artists, poets,\
  \ and kings, embarks on a search that leads him to a terminally ill painter living\
  \ out her final days in the Brooklyn Museum.</b><br /><br />Cyrus Shams is a young\
  \ man grappling with an inheritance of violence and loss: his mother\u2019s plane\
  \ was shot down over the skies of Tehran in a senseless accident; and his father\u2019\
  s life in America was circumscribed by his work killing chickens at a factory farm\
  \ in the Midwest. Cyrus is a drunk, an addict, and a poet, whose obsession with\
  \ martyrs leads him to examine the mysteries of his past\u2014toward an uncle who\
  \ rode through Iranian battlefields dressed as the Angel of death to inspire and\
  \ comfort the dying, and toward his mother, through a painting discovered in a Brooklyn\
  \ art gallery that suggests she may not have been who or what she seemed. <br /><br\
  \ />Electrifying, funny, wholly original, and profound, <i>Martyr!</i> heralds the\
  \ arrival of a blazing and essential new voice in contemporary fiction."
