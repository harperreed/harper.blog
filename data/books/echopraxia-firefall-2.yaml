description: "Prepare for a different kind of singularity in this follow-up to the\
  \ Hugo-nominated novel Blindsight <br /><br />It's the eve of the twenty-second\
  \ century: a world where the dearly departed send postcards back from Heaven and\
  \ evangelicals make scientific breakthroughs by speaking in tongues; where genetically\
  \ engineered vampires solve problems intractable to baseline humans and soldiers\
  \ come with zombie switches that shut off self-awareness during combat. And it\u2019\
  s all under surveillance by an alien presence that refuses to show itself.<br /><br\
  \ />Daniel Bruks is a living fossil: a field biologist in a world where biology\
  \ has turned computational, a cat's-paw used by terrorists to kill thousands. Taking\
  \ refuge in the Oregon desert, he\u2019s turned his back on a humanity that shatters\
  \ into strange new subspecies with every heartbeat. But he awakens one night to\
  \ find himself at the center of a storm that will turn all of history inside-out.\
  \ <br /><br />Now he\u2019s trapped on a ship bound for the center of the solar\
  \ system. To his left is a grief-stricken soldier, obsessed by whispered messages\
  \ from a dead son. To his right is a pilot who hasn\u2019t yet found the man she's\
  \ sworn to kill on sight. A vampire and its entourage of zombie bodyguards lurk\
  \ in the shadows behind. And dead ahead, a handful of rapture-stricken monks takes\
  \ them all to a meeting with something they will only call \u201CThe Angels of the\
  \ Asteroids.\u201D<br /><br />Their pilgrimage brings Dan Bruks, the fossil man,\
  \ face-to-face with the biggest evolutionary breakpoint since the origin of thought\
  \ itself."
