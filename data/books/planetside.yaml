description: "<strong>\n  <em>A seasoned military officer uncovers a deadly conspiracy\
  \ on a distant, war-torn planet\u2026</em>\n</strong><br /><br />War heroes aren't\
  \ usually called out of semi-retirement and sent to the far reaches of the galaxy\
  \ for a routine investigation. So when Colonel Carl Butler answers the call from\
  \ an old and powerful friend, he knows it's something big\u2014and he's not being\
  \ told the whole story. A high councilor's son has gone MIA out of Cappa Base, the\
  \ space station orbiting a battle-ravaged planet. The young lieutenant had been\
  \ wounded and evacuated\u2014but there's no record of him having ever arrived at\
  \ hospital command.\_<br /><br />The colonel quickly finds Cappa Base to be a labyrinth\
  \ of dead ends and sabotage: the hospital commander stonewalls him, the Special\
  \ Ops leader won't come off the planet, witnesses go missing, radar data disappears,\
  \ and that\u2019s before he encounters the alien enemy. Butler has no choice but\
  \ to drop down onto a hostile planet\u2014because someone is using the war zone\
  \ as a cover. The answers are there\u2014Butler just has to make it back alive\u2026"
