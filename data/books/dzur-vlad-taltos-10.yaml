description: <div><b>In which Vlad Taltos confronts the Left Hand of the Jhereg...and
  discovers the game has more players than he thought</b><br /><br />Vlad Taltos,
  short-statured, short-lived human in an Empire of tall, long-lived Dragaerans, has
  always had to keep his wits about him. Long ago, he made a place for himself as
  a captain of the Jhereg, the noble house that runs the rackets in the great imperial
  city of Adrilankha. But love, revolution, betrayal, and revenge ensued, and for
  years now Vlad has been a man on the run, struggling to stay a step ahead of the
  Jhereg who would kill him without hesitation.<br /><br />Now Vlad's back in Adrilankha.
  The rackets he used to run are now under the control of the mysterious "Left Hand
  of the Jhereg"--a secretive cabal of women who report to no man. His ex-wife needs
  his help. His old enemies aren't sure whether they want to kill him, or talk to
  him and then kill him. A goddess may be playing tricks with his memory. And the
  Great Weapon he's carrying seems to have plans of its own...<br /><br />Picking
  up directly where <i>Issola</i> left off, <i>Dzur</i> gives us Vlad Taltos at his
  best--swashbuckling storytelling with a wry and gritty edge.<br /></div>

        \ world.</a>\r\n    \r\n    Of the ordering, the author notes:<blockquote>One\
        \ of the questions I'm most often asked is: \"In what order would you recommend\
        \ reading these books?\" Unfortunately, I'm just exactly the wrong guy to\
        \ ask. I made every effort to write them so that they could be read in any\
        \ order. I am aware that, in some measure at least, I have failed (I certainly\
        \ wouldn't recommend starting with <i>Teckla</i>, for example), but the fact\
        \ that I was trying makes me incapable of giving an answer.\r\n    \r\n  \
        \  Many people whose opinion I respect believe publication order is best .\
        \ . . The choice, I daresay, is yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy them.\r\
        \n    \r\n    --Steven Brust, 1999, in the notes for <i>The Book of Jhereg</i></blockquote>The\
        \ books are numbered in publication order;  here is a rough guide to chronological\
        \ order:\r\n    \r\n        Taltos (1988)\r\n        Dragon (1998)\r\n   \
        \     Yendi (1984)\r\n        Tiassa, section 1 (2011)\r\n        Jhereg (1983)\r\
        \n        Teckla (1987)\r\n        Phoenix (1990)\r\n        Jhegaala (2008)\r\
        \n        Athyra (1993)\r\n        Orca (1996)\r\n        Issola (2001)\r\n\
