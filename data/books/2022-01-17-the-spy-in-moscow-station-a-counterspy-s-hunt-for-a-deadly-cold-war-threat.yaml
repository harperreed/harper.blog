description: <b>The thrilling, true story of the race to find a leak in the United
  States Embassy in Moscow--before more American assets are rounded up and killed.
  </b><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Foreword by Gen. Michael V. Hayden (Retd.), Former
  Director of NSA &amp; CIA</b><br /><br />In the late 1970s, the National Security
  Agency still did not officially exist--those in the know referred to it dryly as
  the No Such Agency. So why, when NSA engineer Charles Gandy filed for a visa to
  visit Moscow, did the Russian Foreign Ministry assert with confidence that he was
  a spy?<br /><br />Outsmarting honey traps and encroaching deep enough into enemy
  territory to perform complicated technical investigations, Gandy accomplished his
  mission in Russia, but discovered more than State and CIA wanted him to know.<br
  /><br />Eric Haseltine's<i> The Spy in Moscow Station </i>tells of a time when--much
  like today--Russian spycraft had proven itself far beyond the best technology the
  U.S. had to offer. The perils of American arrogance mixed with bureaucratic infighting
  left the country unspeakably vulnerable to ultra-sophisticated Russian electronic
  surveillance and espionage.<br /><br />This is the true story of unorthodox, underdog
  intelligence officers who fought an uphill battle against their own government to
  prove that the KGB had pulled off the most devastating penetration of U.S. national
  security in history. If you think The Americans isn't riveting enough, you'll love
  this toe-curling nonfiction thriller.
