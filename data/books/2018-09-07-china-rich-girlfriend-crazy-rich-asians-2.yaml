description: '<b>Kevin Kwan, bestselling author of <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>, is back
  with a wickedly funny new novel of social climbing, secret e-mails, art-world scandal,
  lovesick billionaires, and the outrageous story of what happens when Rachel Chu,
  engaged to marry Asia''s most eligible bachelor, discovers her birth father.<br
  /></b> <br />On the eve of her wedding to Nicholas Young, heir to one of the greatest
  fortunes in Asia, Rachel should be over the moon. She has a flawless Asscher-cut
  diamond from JAR, a wedding dress she loves more than anything found in the salons
  of Paris, and a fiance willing to sacrifice his entire inheritance in order to marry
  her. But Rachel still mourns the fact that her birth father, a man she never knew,
  won''t be able to walk her down the aisle. Until: a shocking revelation draws Rachel
  into a world of Shanghai splendor beyond anything she has ever imagined. Here we
  meet Carlton, a Ferrari-crashing bad boy known for Prince Harry-like antics; Colette,
  a celebrity girlfriend chased by fevered paparazzi; and the man Rachel has spent
  her entire life waiting to meet: her father. Meanwhile, Singapore''s It Girl, Astrid
  Leong, is shocked to discover that there is a downside to having a newly minted
  tech billionaire husband. <br /><br />A romp through Asia''s most exclusive clubs,
  auction houses, and estates, <i>China Rich Girlfriend</i> brings us into the elite
  circles of Mainland China, introducing a captivating cast of characters, and offering
  an inside glimpse at what it''s like to be gloriously, crazily, China-rich.'

      description: When Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her
        boyfriend, Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives
        to explore the island, and quality time with the man she might one day marry.
        What she doesn't know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace,
        that she'll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's
        most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on
        her back.
