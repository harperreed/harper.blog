description: "Enter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders\
  \ from USA Today bestselling author Rebecca Yarros <br /><br />Twenty-year-old Violet\
  \ Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among\
  \ books and history. Now, the commanding general\u2014also known as her tough-as-talons\
  \ mother\u2014has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to\
  \ become the elite of Navarre: dragon riders. <br /><br />But when you\u2019re smaller\
  \ than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because\
  \ dragons don\u2019t bond to \u201Cfragile\u201D humans. They incinerate them. <br\
  \ /><br />With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet\
  \ to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being\
  \ her mother\u2019s daughter\u2014like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless\
  \ wingleader in the Riders Quadrant. <br /><br />She\u2019ll need every edge her\
  \ wits can give her just to see the next sunrise. <br /><br />Yet, with every day\
  \ that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards\
  \ are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to\
  \ suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret. <br /><br />Friends, enemies,\
  \ lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda\u2014because once you enter,\
  \ there are only two ways out: graduate or die ."
