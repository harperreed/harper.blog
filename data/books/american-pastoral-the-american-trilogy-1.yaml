description: "As the American century draws to an uneasy close, Philip Roth gives\
  \ us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all our century's promises\
  \ of prosperity, civic order, and domestic bliss. Roth's protagonist is Swede Levov,\
  \ a legendary athlete at his Newark high school, who grows up in the booming postwar\
  \ years to marry a former Miss New Jersey, inherit his father's glove factory, and\
  \ move into a stone house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. And then one day\
  \ in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.<br /><br />For Swede's adored\
  \ daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical\
  \ teenager\u2014a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism.\
  \ And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longer-for American pastoral and into\
  \ the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage,\
  \ and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece."
