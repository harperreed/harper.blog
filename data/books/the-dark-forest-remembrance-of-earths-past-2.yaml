description: "This is the second novel in the \"Remembrance of Earth\u2019s Past\"\
  \ near-future trilogy. Written by the China's multiple-award-winning science fiction\
  \ author, Cixin Liu. <br /><br />In <i>Dark Forest</i>, Earth is reeling from the\
  \ revelation of a coming alien invasion\u2014four centuries in the future. The aliens'\
  \ human collaborators have been defeated, but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic\
  \ particles that allow Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means\
  \ that Earth's defense plans are exposed to the enemy. Only the human mind remains\
  \ a secret. <br /><br />This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a daring\
  \ plan that grants four men enormous resources to design secret strategies, hidden\
  \ through deceit and misdirection from Earth and Trisolaris alike. Three of the\
  \ Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists, but the fourth is a total\
  \ unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer and sociologist, is baffled\
  \ by his new status. All he knows is that he's the one Wallfacer that Trisolaris\
  \ wants dead."
