description: "\"Never before, in the entire history of the American theater, has so\
  \ much of the truth of black people's lives been seen on the stage,\" observed James\
  \ Baldwin shortly before <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i> opened on Broadway in 1959.<br\
  \ /><br />Indeed Lorraine Hansberry's award-winning drama about the hopes and aspirations\
  \ of a struggling, working-class family living on the South Side of Chicago connected\
  \ profoundly with the psyche of black America--and changed American theater forever.\_\
  \_The play's title comes from a line in Langston Hughes's poem \"Harlem,\" which\
  \ warns that a dream deferred might \"dry up/like a raisin in the sun.\"<br /><br\
  \ />\"The events of every passing year add resonance to <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>,\"\
  \ said <i>The New York Times</i>.\_\_\"It is as if history is conspiring to make\
  \ the play a classic.\"\_\_This Modern Library edition presents the fully restored,\
  \ uncut version of Hansberry's landmark work with an introduction by Robert Nemiroff."
