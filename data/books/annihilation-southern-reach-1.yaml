description: "Area X has been cut off from the rest of the continent for decades.\
  \ Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition\
  \ returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; all the members of the\
  \ second expedition committed suicide; the third expedition died in a hail of gunfire\
  \ as its members turned on one another; the members of the eleventh expedition returned\
  \ as shadows of their former selves, and within months of their return, all had\
  \ died of aggressive cancer.<br /><br />This is the twelfth expedition.<br /><br\
  \ />Their group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist,\
  \ the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the\
  \ terrain and collect specimens; to record all their observations, scientific and\
  \ otherwise, of their surroundings and of one another; and, above all, to avoid\
  \ being contaminated by Area X itself.<br /><br />They arrive expecting the unexpected,\
  \ and Area X delivers\u2014they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life\
  \ forms that surpass understanding\u2014but it\u2019s the surprises that came across\
  \ the border with them, and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from\
  \ one another, that change everything."
