description: "Somewhere on the outer rim of the universe, a mass of decaying world-ships\
  \ known as the Legion is traveling in the seams between the stars.\_For generations,\
  \ a\_war for control of the Legion has been waged, with no clear resolution. \_\
  As worlds continue to die, a desperate plan is put into motion.<br /><br />Zan wakes\
  \ with no memory, prisoner of a people who say they are her family. She is told\
  \ she is their salvation - the only person capable of boarding the Mokshi, a world-ship\
  \ with the power to leave the Legion. But Zan's new family is not the only one desperate\
  \ to gain control of the prized ship. Zan finds that she must choose sides in a\
  \ genocidal campaign that will take her from the edges of the Legion's gravity well\
  \ to the very belly of the world.<br /><br />Zan will soon learn that she carries\
  \ the seeds of the Legion's destruction - and its possible salvation. But can she\
  \ and\_her ragtag band of followers\_survive the horrors of the Legion and its people\
  \ long enough to deliver it?<br /><br />In the tradition of\_<i>The Fall of Hyperion</i>\_\
  and\_<i>Dune</i>,\_<i>The Stars are Legion</i>\_is an epic and thrilling tale about\
  \ tragic love, revenge, and war as imagined by one of the genre's most celebrated\
  \ new writers."
