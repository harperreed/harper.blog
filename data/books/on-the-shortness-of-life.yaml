description: On the Shortness of Life in English is a moral essay written by Seneca
  the Younger in 49 AD, a Roman Stoic philosopher, to his father-in-law Paulinus.
  The philosopher brings up many Stoic principles on the nature of time, namely that
  men waste much of it in meaningless pursuits. According to the essay, nature gives
  man enough time to do what is really important and the individual must allot it
  properly. In general, time can be best used in the study of philosophy, according
  to Seneca. <br /> <br />The same title is also given to a different letter, number
  49 in the Letters to Lucilius. <br />
