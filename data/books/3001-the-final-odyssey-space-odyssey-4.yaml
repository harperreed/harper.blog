description: One thousand years after the Jupiter mission to explore the mysterious
  Monolith had been destroyed, after Dave Bowman was transformed into the Star Child,
  Frank Poole drifted in space, frozen and forgotten, leaving the supercomputer HAL
  inoperable. But now Poole has returned to life, awakening in a world far different
  from the one he left behind--and just as the Monolith may be stirring once again
  . . .
