description: "Creeper, a scrappy young teen, is done living on the streets of New\
  \ Orleans. Instead, she wants to <i>soar</i>, and her sights are set on securing\
  \ passage aboard the smuggler airship <i>Midnight Robber</i>. Her ticket: earning\
  \ Captain Ann-Marie\u2019s trust using a secret about a kidnapped Haitian scientist\
  \ and a mysterious weapon he calls The Black God\u2019s Drums.<br /><br />But Creeper\
  \ keeps another secret close to heart--Oya, the African orisha of the wind and storms,\
  \ who speaks inside her head and grants her divine powers. And Oya has her <i>own\
  \ </i>priorities concerning Creeper and Ann-Marie\u2026"
