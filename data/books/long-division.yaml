description: "<b>From Kiese Laymon, author of the critically acclaimed memoir <i>Heavy</i>,\
  \ comes a debut novel about Black teenagers that is a satirical exploration of celebrity,\
  \ authorship, violence, religion, and coming of age in post-Katrina Mississippi.\
  \ </b><br /><br />Written in a voice that\u2019s alternately humorous, lacerating,\
  \ and wise, <i>Long Division</i> features two interwoven stories. In the first,\
  \ it\u2019s 2013: after an on-stage meltdown during a nationally televised quiz\
  \ contest, fourteen-year-old Citoyen \u201CCity\u201D Coldson becomes an overnight\
  \ YouTube celebrity. The next day, he\u2019s sent to stay with his grandmother in\
  \ the small coastal community of Melahatchie, where a young girl named Baize Shephard\
  \ has recently disappeared.<br /> <br />Before leaving, City is given a strange\
  \ book without an author called <i>Long Division</i>. He learns that one of the\
  \ book\u2019s main characters is also named City Coldson\u2014but <i>Long Division</i>\
  \ is set in 1985. This 1985-version of City, along with his friend and love interest,\
  \ Shalaya Crump, discovers a way to travel into the future, and steals a laptop\
  \ and cellphone from an orphaned teenage rapper called...Baize Shephard. They ultimately\
  \ take these items with them all the way back to 1964, to help another time-traveler\
  \ they meet to protect his family from the Ku Klux Klan.<br /> <br />City\u2019\
  s two stories ultimately converge in the work shed behind his grandmother\u2019\
  s house, where he discovers the key to Baize\u2019s disappearance."
