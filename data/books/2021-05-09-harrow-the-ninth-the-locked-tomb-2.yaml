      description: "The Locked Tomb Series, by Tamsyn Muir, follows the dread adventures\
        \ of Gideon Nav, Harrowhark Nonagesimus, and a host of other goths. These\
        \ epic science fantasy novels mix funny tone with dark subject matter, and\
        \ contain swashbuckling action, waves of bones, and lesbian necromancers in\
        \ space. The series has earned enormous critical praise and rabid reader engagement,\
        \ with the USA Today Best Selling first novel Gideon the Ninth receiving an\
        \ amazing five starred reviews.\n    \n    \u201CUnlike anything I\u2019ve\
        \ ever read. Muir\u2019s writing is as sharp as a broken tooth, and just as\
        \ unsettling. This book is visceral, vivid, and downright violent. In short,\
        \ absolutely marvelous.\u201D \u2014V.E. Schwab, #1 New York Times Bestselling\
