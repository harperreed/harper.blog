description: 'Alternate Cover Edition <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37857551-the-name-of-the-wind"
  rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br /><br />The riveting first-person narrative of a young
  man who grows to be the most notorious magician his world has ever seen. From his
  childhood in a troupe of traveling players, to years spent as a near-feral orphan
  in a crime- ridden city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a legendary
  school of magic, <i>The Name of the Wind</i> is a masterpiece that transports readers
  into the body and mind of a wizard. It is a high-action novel written with a poet''s
  hand, a powerful coming-of-age story of a magically gifted young man, told through
  his eyes: to read this book is to be the hero.'
