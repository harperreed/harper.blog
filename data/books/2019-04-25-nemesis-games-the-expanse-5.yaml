description: The fifth novel in Corey's New York Times bestselling Expanse series--now
  being produced for television by the SyFy Channel!<br /><br />A thousand worlds
  have opened, and the greatest land rush in human history has begun. As wave after
  wave of colonists leave, the power structures of the old solar system begin to buckle.<br
  /><br />Ships are disappearing without a trace. Private armies are being secretly
  formed. The sole remaining protomolecule sample is stolen. Terrorist attacks previously
  considered impossible bring the inner planets to their knees. The sins of the past
  are returning to exact a terrible price.<br /><br />And as a new human order is
  struggling to be born in blood and fire, James Holden and the crew of the Rocinante
  must struggle to survive and get back to the only home they have left.

      note: 'Not entirely sure where to put The Vital Abyss. I would have to re-read
        it to be sure, but I think it might end just before Nemesis Games, which would
        make #4.5 the spot for it. I think the #3.5 ordering is based on the time
        period of the main events of the novella, rather than the time period of the
        last events of the novella. However, I''m leaving it at #5.5 for now, since
        the chronology is unclear and reading it before Nemesis Games is a terrible
        idea.'
