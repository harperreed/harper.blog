description: Perhaps the most important work of philosophy written in the twentieth
  century, the <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> first appeared in 1921 and
  was the only philosophical work that Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) published during
  his lifetime. Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme compression
  and brilliance, it immediately convinced many of its readers and captivated the
  imagination of all. Its chief influence, at first, was on the Logical Positivists
  of the 1920s and 30s, but many other philosophers were stimulated by its philosophy
  of language, finding attractive, if ultimately unsatisfactory, its view that propositions
  were pictures of reality. Perhaps most of all, Wittgenstein himself, after his return
  to philosophy in the late 1920s, was fascinated by its vision of an inexpressible,
  crystalline world of logical relationships. The posthumous publication of other
  writings has, therefore, only served to reawaken interest in the <em>Tractatus</em>
  and to illuminate its more neglected aspects.<br />David Pears and Brian McGuinness
  revised their translation in the light of Wittgenstein's own suggestions and comments
  in his correspondence with C.K. Ogden about the first translation. In addition,
  this edition contains the introduction by Bertrand Russell which appeared in the
  original English translation.
