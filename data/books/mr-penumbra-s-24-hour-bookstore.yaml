description: The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon away from life as a San
  Francisco web-design drone and into the aisles of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore,
  but after a few days on the job, Clay discovers that the store is more curious than
  either its name or its gnomic owner might suggest. The customers are few, and they
  never seem to buy anything; instead, they "check out" large, obscure volumes from
  strange corners of the store. Suspicious, Clay engineers an analysis of the clientele's
  behavior, seeking help from his variously talented friends, but when they bring
  their findings to Mr. Penumbra, they discover the bookstore's secrets extend far
  beyond its walls.
