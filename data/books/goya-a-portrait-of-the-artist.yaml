description: "<b>The first major English-language biography of Francisco Goya y Lucientes,\
  \ who ushered in the modern era</b><br /><br />The life of Francisco Goya (1746\u2013\
  1828) coincided with an age of transformation in Spanish history that brought upheavals\
  \ in the country\u2019s politics and at the court which Goya served, changes in\
  \ society, the devastation of the Iberian Peninsula in the war against Napoleon,\
  \ and an ensuing period of political instability. In this revelatory biography,\
  \ Janis Tomlinson draws on a wide range of documents\u2014including letters, court\
  \ papers, and a sketchbook used by Goya in the early years of his career\u2014to\
  \ provide a nuanced portrait of a complex and multifaceted painter and printmaker,\
  \ whose art is synonymous with compelling images of the people, events, and social\
  \ revolution that defined his life and era.<br /><br />Tomlinson challenges the\
  \ popular image of the artist as an isolated figure obsessed with darkness and death,\
  \ showing how Goya\u2019s likeability and ambition contributed to his success at\
  \ court, and offering new perspectives on his youth, rich family life, extensive\
  \ travels, and lifelong friendships. She explores the full breadth of his imagery\u2014\
  from scenes inspired by life in Madrid to visions of worlds without reason, from\
  \ royal portraits to the atrocities of war. She sheds light on the artist\u2019\
  s personal trials, including the deaths of six children and the onset of deafness\
  \ in middle age, but also reconsiders the conventional interpretation of Goya\u2019\
  s late years as a period of disillusion, viewing them instead as years of liberated\
  \ artistic invention, most famously in the murals on the walls of his country house,\
  \ popularly known as the \u201Cblack\u201D paintings.<br /><br />A monumental achievement,\
  \ <em>Goya: A Portrait of the Artist</em> is the definitive biography of an artist\
  \ whose faith in his art and his genius inspired paintings, drawings, prints, and\
  \ frescoes that continue to captivate, challenge, and surprise us two centuries\
  \ later."
