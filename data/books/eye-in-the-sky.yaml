description: "While sightseeing at the Belmont Bevatron, Jack Hamilton, along with\
  \ seven others, is caught in a lab accident. When he regains consciousness, he is\
  \ in a fantasy world of Old Testament morality gone awry\u2014a place of instant\
  \ plagues, immediate damnations, and death to all perceived infidels. Hamilton figures\
  \ out how he and his compatriots can escape this world and return to their own,\
  \ but first they must pass through three other vividly fantastical worlds, each\
  \ more perilous and hilarious than the one before.<br /><br />Winner of both the\
  \ Hugo and John W. Campbell awards for best novel, widely regarded as the premiere\
  \ science fiction writer of his day, and the object of cult-like adoration from\
  \ his legions of fans, Philip K. Dick has come to be seen in a literary light that\
  \ defies classification in much the same way as Borges and Calvino. With breathtaking\
  \ insight, he utilizes vividly unfamiliar worlds to evoke the hauntingly and hilariously\
  \ familiar in our society and ourselves."
