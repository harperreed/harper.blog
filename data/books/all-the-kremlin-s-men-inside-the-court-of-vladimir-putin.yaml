description: "Charting the transformation of Vladimir Putin from a passionate fan\
  \ of the West and a liberal reformer into a hurt and introverted outcast, <i>All\
  \ the Kremlin\u2019s Men</i> is a historical detective story, full of intrigue and\
  \ conspiracy. This is the story of the political battles that have taken place in\
  \ the court of Vladimir Putin since his rise to power, and a chronicle of friendship\
  \ and hatred between the Russian leader and his foreign partners and opponents.<br\
  \ /><br />Russia's most prominent independent journalist Mikhail Zygar has had unprecedented\
  \ access to people who are either currently or were formerly allied with Putin,\
  \ but have only now agreed to reveal their impressions of the powerful president\
  \ and his circle of power. Zygar's in-depth interviews include Putin\u2019s press\
  \ secretary Dmitry Peskov, Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, former finance minister\
  \ Alexei Kudrin, former Kremlin chief of staff Alexander Voloshin, former mayor\
  \ of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, former presidential candidate Mikhail Prokhorov, opposition\
  \ leader Alexei Navalny, former mresidents of Ukraine and Georgia Viktor Yushchenko\
  \ and Mikhail Saakashvili, and many other key Russian and Western politicians and\
  \ diplomats. For many people from Putin\u2019s closest circle, it was the first\
  \ time they could tell their stories.<br /><br />Each chapter has a main character,\
  \ who gives an insight into the origins of Vladimir Putin\u2019s transformation.\
  \ Cumulatively, <i>All the Kremlin\u2019s Men</i> explains to the English-speaking\
  \ audience what has happened to Russia, what the role of the West is in its destiny,\
  \ and how this destiny could play out going forward. It is a delicious portrait\
  \ of the strangeness of modern Russia, a country swirling with intrigue and paranoia,\
  \ peppered with fateful missteps and confusion, and the brooding, volatile, magnificently\
  \ unpredictable figure of Vladimir Putin.<br />"
