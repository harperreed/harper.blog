description: <b>A bestselling, prizewinning novel of obsession and psychological intrigue
  about two enigmatic unmarried women, one of whom manipulates the other from afar,
  by one of Japan's most acclaimed young writers</b><br /><br />Almost every day,
  the Woman in the Purple Skirt buys a single cream bun and goes to the park, where
  she sits on a bench to eat it as the local children taunt her. She is observed at
  all times by the undetected narrator, the Woman in the Yellow Cardigan. From a distance
  the Woman in the Purple Skirt looks like a schoolgirl, but there are age spots on
  her face, and her hair is dry and stiff. Like the Woman in the Yellow Cardigan,
  she is single, she lives in a small, run-down apartment, and she is short on money.
  The Woman in the Yellow Cardigan lures her to a job where she herself works, as
  a hotel housekeeper; soon the Woman in the Purple Skirt is having an affair with
  the boss. Unfortunately, no one knows or cares about the Woman in the Yellow Cardigan.
  That's the difference between her and the Woman in the Purple Skirt.<br /><br />Studiously
  deadpan, highly original, and unsettling, <i>The Woman in the Purple Skirt</i> explores
  the dynamics of envy, the mechanisms of power in the workplace, and the vulnerability
  of unmarried women in a taut, voyeuristic narrative about the sometimes desperate
  desire to be seen.
