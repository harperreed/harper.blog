description: Created to die - determined to live . . .Jack Four - one of twenty human
  clones - has been created to be sold. His purchasers are the alien prador and they
  only want him for their experimentation program. But there is something different
  about Jack. No clone should possess the knowledge that's been loaded into his mind.
  And no normal citizen of humanity's Polity worlds would have this information. The
  prador's king has been mutated by the Spatterjay virus into a creature even more
  monstrous than the prador themselves. And his children, the King's Guard, have undergone
  similar changes. They were infected by the virus during the last humans-versus-prador
  war, now lapsed into an uneasy truce. But the prador are always looking for new
  weapons - and their experimentation program might give them the edge they seek.
  Suzeal trades human slaves out of the Stratogaster Space Station, re-engineering
  them to serve the prador. She thinks the rewards are worth the risks, but all that
  is about to change. The Station was once a zoo, containing monsters from across
  known space. All the monsters now dwell on the planet below, but they aren't as
  contained as they seem. And a vengeful clone may be the worst danger of all.
