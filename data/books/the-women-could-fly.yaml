description: "Reminiscent of the works of Margaret Atwood, Shirley Jackson, and Octavia\
  \ Butler, a biting social commentary from the acclaimed author of Lakewood that\
  \ speaks to our times\u2014a piercing dystopian novel about the unbreakable bond\
  \ between a young woman and her mysterious mother, set in a world in which witches\
  \ are real and single women are closely monitored.<br /><br />Josephine Thomas has\
  \ heard every conceivable theory about her mother's disappearance. That she was\
  \ kidnapped. Murdered. That she took on a new identity to start a new family. That\
  \ she was a witch. This is the most worrying charge because in a world where witches\
  \ are real, peculiar behavior raises suspicions and a woman\u2014especially a Black\
  \ woman\u2014can find herself on trial for witchcraft. <br /><br />But fourteen\
  \ years have passed since her mother\u2019s disappearance, and now Jo is finally\
  \ ready to let go of the past. Yet her future is in doubt. The State mandates that\
  \ all women marry by the age of 30\u2014or enroll in a registry that allows them\
  \ to be monitored, effectively forfeiting their autonomy. At 28, Jo is ambivalent\
  \ about marriage. With her ability to control her life on the line, she feels as\
  \ if she has her never understood her mother more. When she\u2019s offered the opportunity\
  \ to honor one last request from her mother's will, Jo leaves her regular life to\
  \ feel connected to her one last time.<br /><br />In this powerful and timely novel,\
  \ Megan Giddings explores the limits women face\u2014and the powers they have to\
  \ transgress and transcend them."
