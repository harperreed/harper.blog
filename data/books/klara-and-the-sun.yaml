description: "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<br />A GOOD MORNING AMERICA Book Club Pick!<br\
  \ /><br />A magnificent new novel from the Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro\u2014author\
  \ of Never Let Me Go and the Booker Prize-winning The Remains of the Day.<br /><br\
  \ />Klara and the Sun, the first novel by Kazuo Ishiguro since he was awarded the\
  \ Nobel Prize in Literature, tells the story of Klara, an Artificial Friend with\
  \ outstanding observational qualities, who, from her place in the store, watches\
  \ carefully the behavior of those who come in to browse, and of those who pass on\
  \ the street outside. She remains hopeful that a customer will soon choose her.<br\
  \ /><br />Klara and the Sun is a thrilling book that offers a look at our changing\
  \ world through the eyes of an unforgettable narrator, and one that explores the\
  \ fundamental question: what does it mean to love?"
