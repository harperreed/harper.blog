  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31686251-the-martian\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></i><br\
  \ /><br />Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to\
  \ walk on Mars. <br /><br />Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there.<br\
  \ /><br />After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while\
  \ thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way\
  \ to even signal Earth that he\u2019s alive\u2014and even if he could get word out,\
  \ his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. <br /><br />Chances\
  \ are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving\
  \ environment, or plain-old \"human error\" are much more likely to kill him first.\
  \ <br /><br />But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his\
  \ engineering skills\u2014and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit\u2014he steadfastly\
  \ confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness\
  \ be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?"
