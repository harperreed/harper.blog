description: <p>A revolution brewing for generations has begun in fire. It will end
  in blood.</p><p>The Free Navy - a violent group of Belters in black-market military
  ships - has crippled the Earth and begun a campaign of piracy and violence among
  the outer planets. The colony ships heading for the thousand new worlds on the far
  side of the alien ring gates are easy prey, and no single navy remains strong enough
  to protect them.</p><p>James Holden and his crew know the strengths and weaknesses
  of this new force better than anyone. Outnumbered and outgunned, the embattled remnants
  of the old political powers call on the <i>Rocinante </i>for a desperate mission
  to reach Medina Station at the heart of the gate network. </p><p>But the new alliances
  are as flawed as the old, and the struggle for power has only just begun. As the
  chaos grows, an alien mystery deepens. Pirate fleets, mutiny and betrayal may be
  the least of the <i>Rocinante</i>'s problems. And in the uncanny spaces past the
  ring gates, the choices of a few damaged and desperate people may determine the
  fate of more than just humanity.</p>

      note: 'Not entirely sure where to put The Vital Abyss. I would have to re-read
        it to be sure, but I think it might end just before Nemesis Games, which would
        make #4.5 the spot for it. I think the #3.5 ordering is based on the time
        period of the main events of the novella, rather than the time period of the
        last events of the novella. However, I''m leaving it at #5.5 for now, since
        the chronology is unclear and reading it before Nemesis Games is a terrible
        idea.'
