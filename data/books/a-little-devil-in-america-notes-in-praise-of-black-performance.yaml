description: "<b>A stirring meditation on Black performance in America from the New\
  \ York Times bestselling author of <em>Go Ahead in the Rain</em></b><br /><br />At\
  \ the March on Washington in 1963, Josephine Baker was fifty-seven years old, well\
  \ beyond her most prolific days. But in her speech she was in a mood to consider\
  \ her life, her legacy, her departure from the country she was now triumphantly\
  \ returning to. \u201CI was a devil in other countries, and I was a little devil\
  \ in America, too,\u201D she told the crowd. Inspired by these few words, Hanif\
  \ Abdurraqib has written a profound and lasting reflection on how Black performance\
  \ is inextricably woven into the fabric of American culture. Each moment in every\
  \ performance he examines\u2014whether it\u2019s the twenty-seven seconds in \u201C\
  Gimme Shelter\u201D in which Merry Clayton wails the words \u201Crape, murder,\u201D\
  \ a schoolyard fistfight, a dance marathon, or the instant in a game of spades right\
  \ after the cards are dealt\u2014has layers of resonance in Black and white cultures,\
  \ the politics of American empire, and Abdurraqib\u2019s own personal history of\
  \ love, grief, and performance.<br /><br />Abdurraqib writes prose brimming with\
  \ jubilation and pain, infused with the lyricism and rhythm of the musicians he\
  \ loves. With care and generosity, he explains the poignancy of performances big\
  \ and small, each one feeling intensely familiar and vital, both timeless and desperately\
  \ urgent. Filled with sharp insight, humor, and heart, <em>A Little Devil in America</em>\
  \ exalts the Black performance that unfolds in specific moments in time and space\u2014\
  from midcentury Paris to the moon, and back down again to a cramped living room\
  \ in Columbus, Ohio."
