description: "Join Kiela the librarian and her assistant, Caz the sentient spider\
  \ plant, as they navigate the low stakes market of illegal spellmaking and the high\
  \ risk business of starting over. <br /><br />Kiela has always had trouble dealing\
  \ with people. Thankfully, as librarian at the Great Library of Alyssium, she hasn\u2019\
  t had to. <br /><br />She and her assistant, Caz, a magically sentient spider plant,\
  \ have spent the last eleven years sequestered among the empire\u2019s most precious\
  \ spellbooks, preserving their magic for the city\u2019s elite. But when a revolution\
  \ begins and the library goes up in flames, she and Caz save as many books as they\
  \ can carry and flee to a faraway island Kiela was sure she\u2019d never return\
  \ to: her childhood home. Kiela hopes to lay low in the overgrown and rundown cottage\
  \ her late parents left her and figure out a way to survive without drawing the\
  \ attention of either the empire or the revolutionaries. Much to her dismay, in\
  \ addition to a nosy\u2014and very handsome\u2014neighbor, she finds the town neglected\
  \ and in a state of disrepair. <br /><br />The empire, for all its magic and power,\
  \ has been neglecting for years the people who depend on magical intervention to\
  \ maintain healthy livestock and crops. Not only that, but the very magic that should\
  \ be helping them has been creating destructive storms that have taken a toll on\
  \ the island. Due to her past role at the library, Kiela feels partially responsible\
  \ for this, and now she\u2019s determined to find a way to make things right: by\
  \ opening the island\u2019s first-ever secret spellshop. <br /><br />Her plan comes\
  \ with risks\u2014the consequence of sharing magic with commoners is death. And\
  \ as Kiela comes to make a place for herself among the kind and quirky townspeople\
  \ of her former home, she realizes that in order to make a life for herself, she\
  \ must learn to break down the walls she has built up so high."
