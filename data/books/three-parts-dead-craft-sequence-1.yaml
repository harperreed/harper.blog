description: "A god has died, and it\u2019s up to Tara, first-year associate in the\
  \ international necromantic firm of Kelethres, Albrecht, and Ao, to bring Him back\
  \ to life before His city falls apart.<br /><br />Her client is Kos, recently deceased\
  \ fire god of the city of Alt Coulumb. Without Him, the metropolis\u2019s steam\
  \ generators will shut down, its trains will cease running, and its four million\
  \ citizens will riot.<br /><br />Tara\u2019s job: resurrect Kos before chaos sets\
  \ in. Her only help: Abelard, a chain-smoking priest of the dead god, who\u2019\
  s having an understandable crisis of faith.<br /><br />When Tara and Abelard discover\
  \ that Kos was murdered, they have to make a case in Alt Coulumb\u2019s courts\u2014\
  and their quest for the truth endangers their partnership, their lives, and Alt\
  \ Coulumb\u2019s slim hope of survival.<br /><br />Set in a phenomenally built world\
  \ in which justice is a collective force bestowed on a few, craftsmen fly on lightning\
  \ bolts, and gargoyles can rule cities, <i>Three Parts Dead</i> introduces readers\
  \ to an ethical landscape in which the line between right and wrong blurs."
