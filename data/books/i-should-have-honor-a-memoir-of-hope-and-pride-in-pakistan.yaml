description: <b>A fearless memoir about tribal life in Pakistan--and the act of violence
  that inspired one ambitious young woman to pursue a life of activism and female
  empowerment.</b><br /><br />From a young age, Khalida Brohi was raised to believe
  in the sanctity of arranged marriage. Her mother was forced to marry a thirteen-year-old
  boy when she was only nine; Khalida herself was promised as a bride before she was
  even born. But her father refused to let her become a child bride. He was a man
  who believed in education, not just for himself but for his daughters, and Brohi
  grew up thinking she would become the first female doctor in her small village.
  Brohi thought her life was proceeding on an unusual track for a woman of her circumstances,
  but one whose path was orderly and straightforward.<br /><br />Everything shifted
  for Brohi when she found out her beloved cousin had been murdered by her uncle in
  a tradition known as an honor killing. Her cousin's crime? She had fallen in love
  with a man who was not her betrothed. This moment ignited the spark in Brohi that
  inspired a globe-spanning career as an activist at the age of sixteen. From a tiny
  cement-roofed room in Karachi where she was allowed ten minutes of computer use
  per day, Brohi created a Facebook campaign that went viral. From there, she created
  a foundation focused on empowering the lives of women in rural communities through
  education and employment opportunities, while crucially working to change the minds
  of their male partners, fathers, and brothers. This book is the story of how Brohi,
  while only a girl herself, shined her light on the women and girls of Pakistan,
  despite the hurdles and threats she faced along the way. And ultimately, she learned
  that the only way to eradicate the parts of a culture she despised was to fully
  embrace the parts of it that she loved.
