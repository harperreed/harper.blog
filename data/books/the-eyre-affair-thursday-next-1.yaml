description: 'Suspenseful and outlandish, absorbing and fun - a novel unlike any other
  and an introduction to the imagination of a most distinctive writer and his singular
  fictional universe.<br /><br />Great Britain circa 1985: time travel is routine,
  cloning is a reality (dodos are the resurrected pet of choice), and literature is
  taken very, very seriously. Baconians are trying to convince the world that Francis
  Bacon really wrote Shakespeare, there are riots between the Surrealists and Impressionists,
  and thousands of men are named John Milton, an homage to the real Milton and a very
  confusing situation for the police. Amidst all this, Acheron Hades, Third Most Wanted
  Man In the World, steals the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit and kills
  a minor character, who then disappears from every volume of the novel ever printed!
  But that''s just a prelude . . .<br /><br />Hades'' real target is the beloved Jane
  Eyre, and it''s not long before he plucks her from the pages of Bronte''s novel.
  Enter Thursday Next. She''s the Special Operative''s renowned literary detective,
  and she drives a Porsche. With the help of her uncle Mycroft''s Prose Portal, Thursday
  enters the novel to rescue Jane Eyre from this heinous act of literary homicide.
  It''s tricky business, all these interlopers running about Thornfield, and deceptions
  run rampant as their paths cross with Jane, Rochester, and Miss Fairfax. Can Thursday
  save Jane Eyre and Bronte''s masterpiece? And what of the Crimean War? Will it ever
  end? And what about those annoying black holes that pop up now and again, sucking
  things into time-space voids . . .<br /><br />Suspenseful and outlandish, absorbing
  and fun, The Eyre Affair is a caper unlike any other and an introduction to the
  imagination of a most distinctive writer and his singular fictional universe.'
