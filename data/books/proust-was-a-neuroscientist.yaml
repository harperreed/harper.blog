description: "In this technology-driven age, it\u2019s tempting to believe that science\
  \ can solve every mystery. After all, science has cured countless diseases and even\
  \ sent humans into space. But as Jonah Lehrer argues in this sparkling debut, science\
  \ is not the only path to knowledge. In fact, when it comes to understanding the\
  \ brain, art got there first.<br />Taking a group of artists \u2014 a painter, a\
  \ poet, a chef, a composer, and a handful of novelists \u2014 Lehrer shows how each\
  \ one discovered an essential truth about the mind that science is only now rediscovering.\
  \ We learn, for example, how Proust first revealed the fallibility of memory; how\
  \ George Eliot discovered the brain\u2019s malleability; how the French chef Escoffier\
  \ discovered umami (the fifth taste); how C\xE9zanne worked out the subtleties of\
  \ vision; and how Gertrude Stein exposed the deep structure of language \u2014 a\
  \ full half-century before the work of Noam Chomsky and other linguists. It\u2019\
  s the ultimate tale of art trumping science.<br />More broadly, Lehrer shows that\
  \ there is\_a cost to reducing everything to atoms and acronyms and genes. Measurement\
  \ is not the same as understanding, and art knows this better than science does.\
  \ An ingenious blend of biography, criticism, and first-rate science writing, Proust\
  \ Was a Neuroscientist urges science and art to listen more closely to each other,\
  \ for willing minds can combine the best of both, to brilliant effect."
