description: In <i>Waiting,</i> PEN/Hemingway Award-winning author Ha Jin draws on
  his intimate knowledge of contemporary China to create a novel of unexpected richness
  and feeling. This is the story of Lin Kong, a man living in two worlds, struggling
  with the conflicting claims of two utterly different women as he moves through the
  political minefields of a society designed to regulate his every move and stifle
  the promptings of his innermost heart.<br /><br />For more than seventeen years,
  this devoted and ambitious doctor has been in love with an educated, clever, modern
  woman, Manna Wu. But back in the traditional world of his home village lives the
  wife his family chose for him when he was young--a humble and touchingly loyal woman,
  whom he visits in order to ask, again and again, for a divorce. In a culture in
  which the ancient ties of tradition and family still hold sway and where adultery
  discovered by the Party can ruin lives forever, Lin's passionate love is stretched
  ever more taut by the passing years. Every summer, his compliant wife agrees to
  a divorce but then backs out. This time, Lin promises, will be different.<br /><br
  />Tracing these lives through their summer of decision and beyond, Ha Jin vividly
  conjures the texture of daily life in a place where the demands of human longing
  must contend with the weight of centuries of custom. Waiting charms and startles
  us with its depiction of a China that remains hidden to Western eyes even as it
  moves us with its piercing vision of the universal<br />complications of love.
