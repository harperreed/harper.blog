description: "What would happen if the world were ending?<br /><br />A catastrophic\
  \ event renders the earth a ticking time bomb. In a feverish race against the inevitable,\
  \ nations around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the\
  \ survival of humanity far beyond our atmosphere, in outer space.<br /><br />But\
  \ the complexities and unpredictability of human nature coupled with unforeseen\
  \ challenges and dangers threaten the intrepid pioneers, until only a handful of\
  \ survivors remain . . .<br /><br />Five thousand years later, their progeny\u2014\
  seven distinct races now three billion strong\u2014embark on yet another audacious\
  \ journey into the unknown . . . to an alien world utterly transformed by cataclysm\
  \ and time: Earth.<br /><br />A writer of dazzling genius and imaginative vision,\
  \ Neal Stephenson combines science, philosophy, technology, psychology, and literature\
  \ in a magnificent work of speculative fiction that offers a portrait of a future\
  \ that is both extraordinary and eerily recognizable. As he did in Anathem, Cryptonomicon,\
  \ the Baroque Cycle, and Reamde, Stephenson explores some of our biggest ideas and\
  \ perplexing challenges in a breathtaking saga that is daring, engrossing, and altogether\
  \ brilliant."
