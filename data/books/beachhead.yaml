description: Sam Houston Kellington had from boyhood known that he would someday fly
  to Mars. But what children dream of is often far different in reality from what
  one could ever imagine. Having been chosen as one of a select crew Kelligan does
  go to Mars, only to be marooned with a crippled spacecraft, afflicted with a debilitating
  illness, and abandoned by crewmates. Aided by one brave woman Kelligan must somehow
  find a way to survive the rigors of the hostile planet and return to Earth before
  the members of the first manned mission to Mars have all succumbed.
