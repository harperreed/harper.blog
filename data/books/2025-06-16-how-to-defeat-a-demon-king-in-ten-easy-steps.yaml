description: "For thousands of years, there has been a cycle: a Demon King rises and\
  \ conquers, and a Hero is reborn a hundred years later to defeat him. Each time,\
  \ civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon King's hordes, but humanity\
  \ has remained secure in the belief that a Hero of legend will always save them.\
  \ There's just one slight problem. It's only been 23 years since the Demon King's\
  \ latest rise, and this time, he's already conquered more than half the world. If\
  \ humanity simply waits for the Hero's return, there may be no world left for him\
  \ to save.<br /><br />And so, Yui Shaw sets out with an ambitious plan. A 10-step\
  \ plan.<br /><br />She'll find a way to obtain the Hero's legendary sword. She'll\
  \ earn obscure classes, gain levels, and increase her skills. She'll travel to the\
  \ meticulously-crafted dungeons that seem designed for one specific Hero to complete.\
  \ And, if she's truly (un)fortunate, she might even find a fairy.<br /><br />She\
  \ might not be a Hero\u2014but if she can fake it long enough, she might still be\
  \ able to save the world.<br /><br />***<br /><br />This book is an affectionate\
  \ parody of classic Japanese games like The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and\
  \ Dragon Quest. It's also a work in the LitRPG/GameLit subgenres. Game mechanics\
  \ exist in the world of the story and characters are aware of their existence."
