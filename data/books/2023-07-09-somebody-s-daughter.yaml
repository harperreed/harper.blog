description: "<b>One of the most prominent voices of her generation debuts with an\
  \ extraordinarily powerful memoir: the story of a childhood defined by the ever\
  \ looming absence of her incarcerated father and the path we must take to both honor\
  \ and overcome our origins. </b><br /><br />For as long as she could remember, Ashley\
  \ has put her father on a pedestal. Despite having only vague memories of seeing\
  \ him face-to-face, she believes he's the only person in the entire world who understands\
  \ her. She thinks she understands him too. He's sensitive like her, an artist, and\
  \ maybe even just as afraid of the dark. She's certain that one day they'll be reunited\
  \ again, and she'll finally feel complete. There are just a few problems: he's in\
  \ prison, and she doesn't know what he did to end up there.<br /><br />Through poverty,\
  \ puberty, and a fraught relationship with her mother, Ashley returns to her image\
  \ of her father for hope and encouragement. She doesn't know how to deal with the\
  \ incessant worries that keep her up at night, or how to handle the changes in her\
  \ body that draw unwanted attention from men. In her search for unconditional love,\
  \ Ashley begins dating a boy her mother hates; when the relationship turns sour,\
  \ he assaults her. Still reeling from the rape, which she keeps secret from her\
  \ family, Ashley finally finds out why her father is in prison. And that's where\
  \ the story really begins.<br /><br /><i>Somebody\u2019s Daughter</i> steps into\
  \ the world of growing up a poor Black girl, exploring how isolating and complex\
  \ such a childhood can be. As Ashley battles her body and her environment, she provides\
  \ a poignant coming-of-age recollection that speaks to finding the threads between\
  \ who you are and what you were born into, and the complicated familial love that\
  \ often binds them."
