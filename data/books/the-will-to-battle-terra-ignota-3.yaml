description: "The long years of near-utopia have come to an abrupt end.<br /><br />Peace\
  \ and order are now figments of the past. Corruption, deception, and insurgency\
  \ hum within the once steadfast leadership of the Hives, nations without fixed location.<br\
  \ /><br />The heartbreaking truth is that for decades, even centuries, the leaders\
  \ of the great Hives bought the world\u2019s stability with a trickle of secret\
  \ murders, mathematically planned. So that no faction could ever dominate. So that\
  \ the balance held.<br /><br />The Hives\u2019 fa\xE7ade of solidity is the only\
  \ hope they have for maintaining a semblance of order, for preventing the public\
  \ from succumbing to the savagery and bloodlust of wars past. But as the great secret\
  \ becomes more and more widely known, that fa\xE7ade is slipping away.<br /><br\
  \ />Just days earlier, the world was a pinnacle of human civilization. Now everyone\u2014\
  Hives and hiveless, Utopians and sensayers, emperors and the downtrodden, warriors\
  \ and saints\u2014scrambles to prepare for the seemingly inevitable war."
