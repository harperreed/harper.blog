description: He coined the term "cyberspace..."He envisioned both the Internet and
  virtual reality before either existed...<br /><br />Now, the <b>New York Times </b>bestselling
  author of <b>Neuromancer </b>returns with his hero from <b>Idoru</b>, in a startling
  novel of a shift in time--and cyberspace...<br /><br />"<b>All Tomorrow's Parties
  </b>is immensely engaging, alive on every page and as enjoyable a weekend entertainment
  as one could want."--<b>The Washington Post Book World </b><br /><br />"<b>William
  Gibson</b>'s rich protopointillism coins a wireless future where reality is only
  proxy and proviso. Made all the more beautiful and frightening by its probability,
  and by characters who somehow tweeze hope from the polymer." --<b>Chris Carter</b>,
  creator of <b>The X-Files</b><br /><br />"One of science fiction's greatest literary
  stylists...Gibson wouldn't be Gibson if he spelled it out, if he eliminated all
  the ambiguity. His specialty is hanging on to that fractal edge without ever going
  over the brink." --<b>Wired Magazine</b>
