description: "<b>Seth Dickinson's epic fantasy series which began with <i>The Traitor\
  \ Baru Cormorant</i>, returns with the third book, <i>The Tyrant Baru Cormorant</i>.</b><br\
  \ /><br />The hunt is over. After fifteen years of lies and sacrifice, Baru Cormorant\
  \ has the power to destroy the Imperial Republic of Falcrest that she pretends to\
  \ serve. The secret society called the Cancrioth is real, and Baru is among them.<br\
  \ /><br />But the Cancrioth's weapon cannot distinguish the guilty from the innocent.\
  \ If it escapes quarantine, the ancient hemorrhagic plague called the Kettling will\
  \ kill hundreds of millions...not just in Falcrest, but all across the world. History\
  \ will end in a black bloodstain.<br /><br />Is that justice? Is this really what\
  \ Tain Hu hoped for when she sacrificed herself?<br /><br />Baru's enemies close\
  \ in from all sides. Baru's own mind teeters on the edge of madness or shattering\
  \ revelation. Now she must choose between genocidal revenge and a far more difficult\
  \ path\u2014a conspiracy of judges, kings, spies and immortals, puppeteering the\
  \ world's riches and two great wars in a gambit for the ultimate prize.<br /><br\
  \ />If Baru had absolute power over the Imperial Republic, she could force Falcrest\
  \ to abandon its colonies and make right its crimes."
