description: "An epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history\
  \ of China\u2019s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic.<br /><br\
  \ />When Rin aced the Keju\u2014the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth\
  \ to learn at the Academies\u2014it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials,\
  \ who couldn\u2019t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without\
  \ cheating; to Rin\u2019s guardians, who believed they\u2019d finally be able to\
  \ marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized\
  \ she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence.\
  \ That she got into Sinegard\u2014the most elite military school in Nikan\u2014\
  was even more surprising.<br /><br />But surprises aren\u2019t always good.<br /><br\
  \ />Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing\
  \ at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty,\
  \ and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power\u2014an aptitude\
  \ for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with\
  \ the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns\
  \ that gods long thought dead are very much alive\u2014and that mastering control\
  \ over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.<br /><br />For while\
  \ the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow\
  \ sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First\
  \ Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of\
  \ the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third\
  \ Poppy War is just a spark away . . .<br /><br />Rin\u2019s shamanic powers may\
  \ be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that\
  \ has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost\
  \ her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late."
