description: In <i>The Man Who Japed</i>, a world that has survived a nuclear holocaust
  has given way to a rigid system of oppressive morality. Highly mobile and miniature
  robots monitor the behavior ot every citizen, and the slightest transgression can
  spell personal doom. Allen Purcell is one of the few people who has the capacity
  to literally change the way of the world, and once he's offered a high-profile job
  that acts as guardian of public ethics, he sets out to do precisely that, but first
  he has to deal with the head in his closet.<br /><br />
