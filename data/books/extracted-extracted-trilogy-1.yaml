  \ his past. But his good intentions turn catastrophic when an early test reveals\

  \ Recruit three heroes, ordinary humans capable of extraordinary things, and change\
  \ the future.<br /><br />Safa Patel is an elite police officer, on duty when Downing\
  \ Street comes under terrorist attack. As armed men storm through the breach, she\
  \ dispatches them all.<br /><br />'Mad' Harry Madden is a legend of the Second World\
  \ War. Not only did he complete an impossible mission\u2014to plant charges on a\
  \ heavily defended submarine base\u2014but he also escaped with his life.<br /><br\
  \ />Ben Ryder is just an insurance investigator. But as a young man he witnessed\
  \ a gang assaulting a woman and her child. He went to their rescue, and killed all\
  \ five.<br /><br />Can these three heroes, extracted from their timelines at the\
  \ point of death, save the world?"
