description: 'The brash and outrageously funny autobiography of music legend Frank
  Zappa--now in trade paperback. Here is the real story of how he became the state
  of the art in weirdness, as only he can tell it: wild rock ''n'' roll road stories,
  confrontations with bureaucratic idiocy, and more. Black-and-white photographs and
  line drawings throughout.'
