description: "<b>Brandon Sanderson's The Stormlight Archive sequence began in 2010\
  \ with the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Way of Kings</i>. Now, the eagerly\
  \ anticipated <i>Words of Radiance</i> continues the epic story and answers many\
  \ of your questions.</b><br /><br />Six years ago, the Assassin in White, a hireling\
  \ of the inscrutable Parshendi, assassinated the Alethi king on the very night a\
  \ treaty between men and Parshendi was being celebrated. So began the Vengeance\
  \ Pact among the highprinces of Alethkar and the War of Reckoning against the Parshendi.<br\
  \ /><br />Now the Assassin is active again, murdering rulers all over the world\
  \ of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers.\
  \ Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind\
  \ the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the\
  \ Assassin's master has much deeper motives.<br /><br />Expected by his enemies\
  \ to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command\
  \ of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status \"darkeyes.\"\
  \ Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the\
  \ distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master\
  \ remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.<br /><br\
  \ />Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being\
  \ broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow\
  \ prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation\
  \ that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains,\
  \ but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.<br\
  \ /><br />Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making\
  \ an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever\
  \ shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything\
  \ on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible\
  \ consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as\
  \ dangerous as they are incalculable.<br /><br />The doors of the Stormlight Archive\
  \ first opened to us with <i>The Way of Kings</i>. Read that book \u2013 now available\
  \ in all formats \u2013 and then Words of Radiance, and you can be part of the adventure\
  \ every dazzling step of the way.<br /><br />At the Publisher's request, this title\
  \ is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied."

      description: "\n\n    Brandon Sanderson's epic fantasy cycle tells the story\
        \ of Roshar, a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power\
        \ sweep across the rocky terrain. It has been centuries since the fall of\
        \ the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades\
        \ and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform\
        \ ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. As brutal wars rage over the\
        \ control of these magical weapons, an ancient text called The Way of Kings\
        \ tells of ancient times, the Knights Radiant, and perhaps the true cause\
        \ of the war. The Knights Radiant must stand again.\r\n    \r\n    https://us.macmillan.com/series/thestormlightarchive\r\
        \n    \r\n    #0.5, <I>The Way of Kings Prime</I>, was written in 2002 and\
        \ is basically an alternate version of <I>The Way of Kings</I>, which was\
        \ published by Tor Books in 2010. <I>The Way of Kings Prime</I> is very different\
        \ from the published book. Think of it as set in a different universe with\
        \ a completely different plot. <B>If you haven\u2019t read the 2010 canonical\
        \ version, please read that one first.</B> -- from author's website (emphasis\
        \ mine)\r\n    \r\n    One novel set in this world is the short story \"Rysn\"\
        \ from the anthology Epic - Legends of Fantasy. \r\n    \r\n    The Stormlight\
        \ Archive series will have 10 books: first five books will form first part\
        \ sequence, while other five books will form the second part of the series.\r\
