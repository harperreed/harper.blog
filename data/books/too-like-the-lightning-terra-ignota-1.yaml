description: "Mycroft Canner is a convict. For his crimes he is required, as is the\
  \ custom of the 25th century, to wander the world being as useful as he can to all\
  \ he meets. Carlyle Foster is a sensayer \u2013 a spiritual counselor in a world\
  \ that has outlawed the public practice of religion, but which also knows that the\
  \ inner lives of humans cannot be wished away.<br /><br />The world into which Mycroft\
  \ and Carlyle have been born is as strange to our 21st-century eyes as ours would\
  \ be to a native of the 1500s. It is a hard-won utopia built on technologically-generated\
  \ abundance, and also on complex and mandatory systems of labelling all public writing\
  \ and speech. What seem to us normal gender distinctions are now distinctly taboo\
  \ in most social situations. And most of the world's population is affiliated with\
  \ globe-girdling clans of the like-minded, whose endless economic and cultural competition\
  \ is carefully managed by central planners of inestimable subtlety. To us it seems\
  \ like a mad combination of heaven and hell. To them, it seems like normal life.<br\
  \ /><br />And in this world, Mycroft and Carlyle have stumbled on the wild card\
  \ that may destablize the system: the boy Bridger, who can effortlessly make his\
  \ wishes come true. Who can, it would seem, bring inanimate objects to life..."

      description: "\n\n    Science fiction often has asked contemporary questions\
        \ of an imagined future.  In the four-volume Terra Ignota novel series, author\
        \ Ada Palmer has reflected this tradition back upon itself, exploring the\
        \ questions the brilliant world of 2454 might ask when faced with its own\
        \ unknowable future.  After citizenship and religion, family and language,\
        \ law and freedom have been utterly reformed over half a century of war and\
        \ three centuries of peace, where do the denizens of a near-Utopia turn for\
        \ answers when their world order faces upheaval?  A notorious criminal genius\
        \ is the historian of the world\u2019s remaking; a mysterious spiritual counselor\
        \ seeks truth in a world that has atomized religion; carnality and high politics\
        \ join to preserve the old order as a rumored god, an omnipotent child, a\
        \ celebrity assassin and a living myth struggle to shape the future as a rediscovered\
        \ orator calls for inevitable war.\n\n"
