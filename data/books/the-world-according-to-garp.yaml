description: 'This is the life of T.S. Garp, the bastard son of Jenny Fields--a feminist
  leader ahead of her time. This is the life and death of a famous mother and her
  almost-famous son; theirs is a world of sexual extremes--even of sexual assassinations.
  It is a novel rich with "lunacy and sorrow"; yet the dark, violent events of the
  story do not undermine a comedy both ribald and robust. In more than forty countries--with
  more than ten million copies in print--this novel provides almost cheerful, even
  hilarious evidence of its famous last line: "In the world according to Garp, we
  are all terminal cases."'
