description: "The year is 2052. Climate change has had a predictably devastating effect:\
  \ Venice submerged, cyclones in Oklahoma, megafires in South America. Yet it could\
  \ be much worse. Two decades earlier, the global protest movement known as the Upheavals\
  \ helped break the planet\u2019s fossil fuel dependency, and the subsequent Nuremberg-like\
  \ Toronto Trials convicted the most powerful oil executives and lobbyists for crimes\
  \ against the environment. Not all of them. A few executives escaped arrest and\
  \ went into hiding, including pipeline mastermind Robert Cave.<br /> <br />Now,\
  \ a Pacific Northwest journalist named Jack Henry who works for a struggling media\
  \ company has received a tip that Cave is living in Mexico. Hoping the story will\
  \ save his job, he travels south and, using a fake identity, makes contact with\
  \ the fugitive. The two men strike up an unexpected friendship, leaving Jack torn\
  \ about exposing Cave\u2014an uncertainty further compounded by the diagnosis of\
  \ a life-threatening illness and a new romance with an old acquaintance. Who will\
  \ really benefit from the unmasking? What is the nature of justice and punishment?\
  \ How does one contend with mortality when the planet itself is dying?<br /> <br\
  \ /><i>Denial</i> is both a page-turning speculative suspense novel and a powerful\
