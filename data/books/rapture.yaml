description: "After years in exile, Nyxnissa so Dasheem is once more a bel dame, part\
  \ of a sisterhood of elite government assassins trained to a cut a target\u2019\
  s head off without remorse. But the end of a centuries-long war has thrown her native\
  \ land of Nasheen into turmoil. A huge influx of unemployed\u2013and unemployable\u2013\
  young soldiers have brought Nasheen to the brink of civil war, even as an alien\
  \ spaceship stations itself in orbit above the capital.<br /><br />With aliens in\
  \ the sky and revolution on the ground, Nyx figures it\u2019s a good time to get\
  \ the hell out of Nasheen, so she assembles a team of renegades, shape-shifters,\
  \ magicians, and mercenaries to rescue a missing political leader who may be the\
  \ difference between peace and bloodshed.<br /><br />Just one problem: the politician\
  \ is an old enemy whom Nyx once left to die in a ditch . ."
