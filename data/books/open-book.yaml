description: Jessica tells of growing up in 1980s Texas where she was sexually abused
  by the daughter of a family friend, and of unsuccessfully auditioning for the Mickey
  Mouse Club at age 13 with Justin Timberlake and Ryan Gosling before going on to
  sign a record deal with Columbia and marrying 98 Degrees member Nick Lachey. <br
  /><br />Along the way, she details the struggles in her life, such as the pressure
  to support her family as a teenager, divorcing Lachey, enduring what she describes
  as an emotionally abusive relationship with musician John Mayer, being body-shamed
  in an overly appearance-centered industry, and going through bouts of heavy drinking.
  But Simpson ends on a positive note, discussing her billion-dollar apparel line
  and marriage with professional football star Eric Johnson, with whom she has three
  children.
