description: "<i>A world at stake.<br />A quest for the ultimate prize.<br /><b>Are\
  \ you ready?<br /></b></i> <br />It\u2019s the year 2044, and the real world is\
  \ an ugly place. <br />Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings\
  \ by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia\
  \ that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play\
  \ and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets.<br /><br />And like most of humanity,\
  \ Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies\
  \ concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked\
  \ playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles\
  \ that will yield massive fortune\u2014and remarkable power\u2014to whoever can\
  \ unlock them.<br /><br />For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain\
  \ this prize, knowing only that Halliday\u2019s riddles are based in the pop culture\
  \ he loved\u2014that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have\
  \ found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive\
  \ study of Halliday\u2019s icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable\
  \ debating the finer points of John Hughes\u2019s oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting\
  \ Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.<br /><br />And then\
  \ Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.<br /><br />Suddenly the whole world is watching,\
  \ and thousands of competitors join the hunt\u2014among them certain powerful players\
  \ who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the\
  \ only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to<i> win</i>.\
  \ But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence\
  \ and face up to life\u2014and love\u2014in the real world he\u2019s always been\
  \ so desperate to escape."
