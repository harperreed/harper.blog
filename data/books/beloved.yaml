description: 'Staring unflinchingly into the abyss of slavery, this spellbinding novel
  transforms history into a story as powerful as Exodus and as intimate as a lullaby.
  <br /><br />Sethe was born a slave and escaped to Ohio, but eighteen years later
  she is still not free. She has too many memories of Sweet Home, the beautiful farm
  where so many hideous things happened. Her new home is haunted by the ghost of her
  baby, who died nameless and whose tombstone is engraved with a single word: Beloved.
  <br /><br />Filled with bitter poetry and suspense as taut as a rope, <i>Beloved</i>
  is a towering achievement by Nobel Prize laureate Toni Morrison.'
