description: <p>This reissue of a modern classic of science fiction, the Hugo and
  Locus Award-winning and Nebula-nominated <i>The Snow Queen</i>, marks the first
  time the book has been reprinted in fifteen years.</p><p>The imperious Winter colonists
  have ruled the planet Tiamat for 150 years, deriving wealth from the slaughter of
  the sea mers. But soon the galactic stargate will close, isolating Tiamat, and the
  150-year reign of the Summer primitives will begin. Their only chance at surviving
  the change is if Arienrhod, the ageless, corrupt Snow Queen, can destroy destiny
  with an act of genocide. Arienrhod is not without competition as Moon, a young Summer-tribe
  sibyl, and the nemesis of the Snow Queen, battles to break a conspiracy that spans
  space. Interstellar politics, a millennia-long secret conspiracy, and a civilization
  whose hidden machineries might still control the fate of worlds all form the background
  to this spectacular hard science fiction novel from Joan D. Vinge.</p>
