      description: "The Revelation Space universe is a fictional universe which was\
        \ created by Alastair Reynolds and used as the setting for a number of his\
        \ novels and stories. Its fictional history follows the human species through\
        \ various conflicts from the relatively near future (roughly 2200) to approximately\
        \ AD 40000 (all the novels to date are set between 2427 and 2727, although\
        \ certain stories extend beyond this period). It takes its name from Revelation\
        \ Space, which was the first published novel set in the universe.\n    \n\
        \    The main trilogy (also known as the Inhibitor trilogy) consists of 1)\
        \ Revelation Space, 2) Redemption Ark, 3) Absolution Gap, with the new addition\
        \ of 4) Inhibitor Phase, and deals with humanity coming to the attention of\
        \ the inhibitors and the resultant war between them.\n    \n    Reynolds says\
        \ of the reading order: \"Of my books to date, five are set in the same universe.\
        \ <b>The reading order isn\u2019t that critical</b>, in my view, but it probably\
        \ improves things to read REVELATION SPACE, REDEMPTION ARK and ABSOLUTION\
        \ GAP in that sequence. The other related books, CHASM CITY and THE PREFECT,\
        \ as well as the collections DIAMOND DOGS, TURQUOISE DAYS and GALACTIC NORTH,\
        \ can be read at any point (or in fact, not read at all).\"\n    \n    This\
        \ is the approximate chronological order for the short stories, novels and\
        \ novellas:\n    \n    Great Wall of Mars* - <i>(2205, published February\
        \ 2000)</i>\n    Glacial* - <i>(2217, published March 2001)</i>\n    A Spy\
        \ in Europa* - <i>(ca. 2330 - 2340, published 1997)</i>\n    Weather* - <i>(2358,\
        \ published 2006)</i>\n    The Prefect (aka Aurora Rising) (Novel, Prefect\
        \ Dreyfus #1) - <i>(2427, published 2007)</i>\n    Open and Shut (Prefect\
        \ Dreyfus story) - <i> (2427, published 2018)</i>\n    Elysium Fire (Novel,\
        \ Prefect Dreyfus #2) - <i> (2429, published 2018)</i>\n    The Last Log of\
        \ the Lachrimosa**** - <i>(ca. 2500 - 2550, published 2014)</i>\n    Diamond\
        \ Dogs** - <i>(ca. 2500 - 2550, published 2001)</i>\n    Monkey Suit*** -\
        \ <i>(ca. 2511, published 2009)</i>\n    Dilation Sleep* - <i>(ca. 2513 -\
        \ 2540, published 1990)</i>\n    Chasm City (Novel, Standalone) - <i>(ca.\
        \ 2517 - 2524, published 2001)</i>\n    Grafenwalder's Bestiary* - <i>(ca.\
        \ 2540, published 2006)</i>\n    Turquoise Days** - <i>(2541, published 2002)</i>\n\
        \    Revelation Space (Novel, #1 of The Inhibitor Trilogy) - <i>(2524 - 2567,\
        \ published 2000)</i>\n    Nightingale* - <i>(ca. 2600, published 2006)</i>\n\
        \    Redemption Ark (Novel, #2 of The Inhibitor Trilogy) - <i>(2605 - 2651,\
        \ published 2002)</i>\n    Absolution Gap (Novel, #3 of The Inhibitor Trilogy)\
        \ - <i>(ca. 2615 - 3125, published 2003)</i>\n    Galactic North* - <i>(ca.\
        \ 2303 - 40000, published 1999)</i>\n    \n    *Story or Novella in Galactic\
        \ North\n    **Novella in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days\n    ***Story originally\
        \ published in Death Ray #20 (July 2009); reprinted in Deep Navigation\n \
        \   ****Story originally published in Subterranean (Summer 2014); also on\
        \ their website\n    \n    The reading order for Alastair Reynolds' Revelation\
        \ Space universe stories is complex, with the novels overlapping with the\
        \ short stories (collected in Galactic North) and the two novellas (collected\
        \ in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days). Whether the chronological order is the\
        \ best reading order for the books or not is debatable. It mostly works, although\
        \  'Weather' contains the answer to a major mystery from the main trilogy\
        \ about the Conjoiner lighthugger drives and may benefit from being read later\
        \ on. \n    \n    'Great Wall of Mars' and 'Glacial' introduce characters\
        \ who otherwise show up out of nowhere in Redemption Ark, and 'Galactic North'\
        \ (the story)  explains the ending to Absolution Gap and puts something of\
        \ a full stop on the whole series and story."
