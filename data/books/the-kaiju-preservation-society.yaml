description: <b><i>The Kaiju Preservation Society</i> is John Scalzi's first standalone
  adventure since the conclusion of his <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Interdependency
  trilogy.</b><br /><br />When COVID-19 sweeps through New York City, Jamie Gray is
  stuck as a dead-end driver for food delivery apps. That is, until Jamie makes a
  delivery to an old acquaintance, Tom, who works at what he calls "an animal rights
  organization." Tom's team needs a last-minute grunt to handle things on their next
  field visit. Jamie, eager to do anything, immediately signs on.<br /><br />What
  Tom doesn't tell Jamie is that the animals his team cares for are not here on Earth.
  Not our Earth, at at least. In an alternate dimension, massive dinosaur-like creatures
  named Kaiju roam a warm and human-free world. They're the universe's largest and
  most dangerous panda and they're in trouble.<br /><br />It's not just the Kaiju
  Preservation Society that's found its way to the alternate world. Others have, too--and
  their carelessness could cause millions back on our Earth to die.
