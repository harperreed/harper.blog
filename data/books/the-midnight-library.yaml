description: "<b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling WORLDWIDE phenomenon<br />\
  \ <br />Winner of the Goodreads Choice Award for Fiction | A Good Morning America\
  \ Book Club Pick<br /> <br />\"A feel-good book guaranteed to lift your spirits.\"\
  \u2014<i>The Washington Post</i> <br /><br />The dazzling reader-favorite about\
  \ the choices that go into a life well lived, from the acclaimed author of <i>How\
  \ To Stop Time</i> and <i>The Comfort Book</i>.</b><br /> <br />Somewhere out beyond\
  \ the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of\
  \ books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life\
  \ as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you\
  \ had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how\
  \ our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and\
  \ see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?<br /><br />In\
  \ <i>The Midnight Library</i>, Matt Haig's enchanting blockbuster novel, Nora Seed\
  \ finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing\
  \ her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing\
  \ her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels\
  \ through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what\
  \ makes it worth living in the first place."
