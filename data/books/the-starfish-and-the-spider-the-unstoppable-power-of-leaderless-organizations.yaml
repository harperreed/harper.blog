description: "If you cut off a spider\u2019s leg, it\u2019s crippled; if you cut off\
  \ its head, it dies. But if you cut off a starfish\u2019s leg it grows a new one,\
  \ and the old leg can grow into an entirely new starfish.<br />What\u2019s the hidden\
  \ power behind the success of Wikipedia, Craigslist, and Skype? What do eBay and\
  \ General Electric have in common with the abolitionist and women\u2019s rights\
  \ movements? What fundamental choice put General Motors and Toyota on vastly different\
  \ paths? How could winning a Supreme Court case be the biggest mistake MGM could\
  \ have made?<br /><br />After five years of ground-breaking research, Ori Brafman\
  \ and Rod Beckstrom share some unexpected answers, gripping stories, and a tapestry\
  \ of unlikely connections. The Starfish and the Spider argues that organizations\
  \ fall into two categories: traditional \u201Cspiders,\u201D which have a rigid\
  \ hierarchy and top-down leadership, and revolutionary \u201Cstarfish,\u201D which\
  \ rely on the power of peer relationships.<br /><br />The Starfish and the Spider\
  \ explores what happens when starfish take on spiders (such as the music industry\
  \ vs. Napster, Kazaa, and the P2P services that followed). It reveals how established\
  \ companies and institutions, from IBM to Intuit to the US government, are also\
  \ learning how to incorporate starfish principles to achieve success. The book explores:<br\
  \ /><br />* How the Apaches fended off the powerful Spanish army for 200 years<br\
  \ />* The power of a simple circle<br />* The importance of catalysts who have an\
  \ uncanny ability to bring people together <br />* How the Internet has become a\
  \ breeding ground for leaderless organizations<br />* How Alcoholics Anonymous has\
  \ reached untold millions with only a shared ideology and without a leader<br /><br\
  \ />The Starfish and the Spider is the rare book that will change how you understand\
  \ the world around you."
