description: "A real-life political thriller about an American financier in the Wild\
  \ East of Russia, the murder of his principled young tax attorney, and his dangerous\
  \ mission to expose the Kremlin\u2019s corruption.<br /><br />Bill Browder\u2019\
  s journey started on the South Side of Chicago and moved through Stanford Business\
  \ School to the dog-eat-dog world of hedge fund investing in the 1990s. It continued\
  \ in Moscow, where Browder made his fortune heading the largest investment fund\
  \ in Russia after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. But when he exposed the corrupt\
  \ oligarchs who were robbing the companies in which he was investing, Vladimir Putin\
  \ turned on him and, in 2005, had him expelled from Russia. <br /><br />In 2007,\
  \ a group of law enforcement officers raided Browder\u2019s offices in Moscow and\
  \ stole $230 million of taxes that his fund\u2019s companies had paid to the Russian\
  \ government. Browder\u2019s attorney Sergei Magnitsky investigated the incident\
  \ and uncovered a sprawling criminal enterprise. A month after Sergei testified\
  \ against the officials involved, he was arrested and thrown into pre-trial detention,\
  \ where he was tortured for a year. On November 16, 2009, he was led to an isolation\
  \ chamber, handcuffed to a bedrail, and beaten to death by eight guards in full\
  \ riot gear. <br /><br />Browder glimpsed the heart of darkness, and it transformed\
  \ his life: he embarked on an unrelenting quest for justice in Sergei\u2019s name,\
  \ exposing the towering cover-up that leads right up to Putin. A financial caper,\
  \ a crime thriller, and a political crusade, <i>Red Notice</i> is the story of one\
  \ man taking on overpowering odds to change the world."
