description: "<b>An outsider who can travel between worlds discovers a secret that\
  \ threatens her new home and her fragile place in it, in a stunning sci-fi debut\
  \ that\u2019s both a cross-dimensional adventure and a powerful examination of identity,\
  \ privilege, and belonging.</b><br /><br />Multiverse travel is finally possible,\
  \ but there\u2019s just one catch: No one can visit a world where their counterpart\
  \ is still alive. Enter Cara, whose parallel selves happen to be exceptionally good\
  \ at dying\u2014from disease, turf wars, or vendettas they couldn\u2019t outrun.\
  \ Cara\u2019s life has been cut short on 372 worlds in total.<br /><br />On this\
  \ Earth, however, Cara has survived. Identified as an outlier and therefore a perfect\
  \ candidate for multiverse travel, Cara is plucked from the dirt of the wastelands.\
  \ Now she has a nice apartment on the lower levels of the wealthy and walled-off\
  \ Wiley City. She works\u2014and shamelessly flirts\u2014with her enticing yet aloof\
  \ handler, Dell, as the two women collect off-world data for the Eldridge Institute.\
  \ She even occasionally leaves the city to visit her family in the wastes, though\
  \ she struggles to feel at home in either place. So long as she can keep her head\
  \ down and avoid trouble, Cara is on a sure path to citizenship and security.<br\
  \ /><br />But trouble finds Cara when one of her eight remaining doppelg\xE4ngers\
  \ dies under mysterious circumstances, plunging her into a new world with an old\
  \ secret. What she discovers will connect her past and her future in ways she could\
  \ have never imagined\u2014and reveal her own role in a plot that endangers not\
  \ just her world, but the entire multiverse."
