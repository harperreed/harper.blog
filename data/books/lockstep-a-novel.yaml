description: "When seventeen-year-old Toby McGonigal finds himself lost in space,\
  \ separated from his family, he expects his next drift into cold sleep to be his\
  \ last. After all, the planet he\u2019s orbiting is frozen and sunless, and the\
  \ cities are dead. But when Toby wakes again, he\u2019s surprised to discover a\
  \ thriving planet, a strange and prosperous galaxy, and something stranger still\u2014\
  that he\u2019s been asleep for 14,000 years.<br /><br />Welcome to the Lockstep\
  \ Empire, where civilization is kept alive by careful hibernation. Here cold sleeps\
  \ can last decades and waking moments mere weeks. Its citizens survive for millennia,\
  \ traveling asleep on long voyages between worlds. Not only is Lockstep the new\
  \ center of the galaxy, but Toby is shocked to learn that the Empire is still ruled\
  \ by its founding family: his own.<br /><br />Toby\u2019s brother Peter has become\
  \ a terrible tyrant. Suspicious of the return of his long-lost brother, whose rightful\
  \ inheritance also controls the lockstep hibernation cycles, Peter sees Toby as\
  \ a threat to his regime. Now, with the help of a lockstep girl named Corva, Toby\
  \ must survive the forces of this new Empire, outwit his siblings, and save human\
  \ civilization.<br /><br />Karl Schroeder's <i>Lockstep</i> is a grand innovation\
  \ in hard SF space opera."
