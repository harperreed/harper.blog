description: "Arif Naqvi was charismatic, inspiring, and self-made\u2014all the qualities\
  \ of a successful business leader. The founder of Abraaj, a Dubai-based private-equity\
  \ firm, Naqvi was the Key Man to the global elite searching for impact investments\
  \ to make money and do good. He persuaded politicians he could help stabilize the\
  \ Middle East after 9/11 by providing jobs and guided executives to opportunities\
  \ in cities they struggled to find on the map. Bill Gates helped him start a $1\
  \ billion fund to improve healthcare in poor countries and the UN and Interpol appointed\
  \ him to boards. As Pope Francis blessed a move to harness capitalism for the good\
  \ of the poor, Naqvi won the support of Obama\u2019s administration and investors,\
  \ who compared him to Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible.<br /><br />In 2018, Simon\
  \ Clark and Will Louch were contacted by an anonymous whistleblower who said Naqvi\
  \ had swindled investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars and offered bribes\
  \ to sustain his billionaire lifestyle. Digging into the claims, Clark and Louch\
  \ uncovered hundreds of documents and exposed the wrongdoing. In April 2019\u2014\
  months after their expos\xE9 broke\u2014Naqvi was arrested on charges of fraud and\
  \ racketeering, and faces up to 291 years in jail.\_<br /><br />Populated by a cast\
  \ of larger-than-life characters and moving across Asia, Africa, Europe and America,\
  \ <em>The Key Man </em>is the story of how the global elite was duped by a capitalist\
  \ fairytale. Clark and Louch shine a light on efforts to clean up global capital\
  \ flows even as opaque private equity firms amass trillions of dollars and offshore\
  \ tax havens cast a veil of secrecy which prevents regulators, investors and citizens\
  \ from understanding what\u2019s really going on in the finance industry.\_"
