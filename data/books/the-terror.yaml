description: 'The men on board The HMS Terror - part of the ill-fated 1845 Franklin
  Expedition - are entering a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, stranded
  in a nightmarish landscape of ice and desolation. Endlessly cold, they struggle
  to survive with poisonous rations and a dwindling coal supply. But their real enemy
  is even more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an
  unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror clawing to get in.'
