description: "<b>Yume Kitasei's <i>The Deep Sky</i> is an enthralling sci fi thriller\
  \ debut about a mission into deep space that begins with a lethal explosion that\
  \ leaves the survivors questioning the loyalty of the crew.<br /><br />To save humanity,\
  \ they left everything behind\u2014except their differences.</b><br /><br />It is\
  \ the eve of Earth's environmental collapse. A single ship carries humanity's last\
  \ hope: eighty elite graduates of a competitive program, who will give birth to\
  \ a generation of children in deep space. But halfway to a distant but livable planet,\
  \ a lethal bomb kills three of the crew and knocks <i>The Phoenix</i> off course.\
  \ Asuka, the only surviving witness, is an immediate suspect.<br /><br />Asuka already\
  \ felt like an impostor before the explosion. She was the last picked for the mission,\
  \ she struggled during training back on Earth, and she was chosen to represent Japan,\
  \ a country she only partly knows as a half-Japanese girl raised in America. But\
  \ estranged from her mother back home, <i>The Phoenix</i> is all she has left.<br\
  \ /><br />With the crew turning on each other, Asuka is determined to find the culprit\
  \ before they all lose faith in the mission\u2014or worse, the bomber strikes again.\
  \ Now, in order to survive, she must burn brighter than the stars that surround\
  \ her."
