description: "<b>Time Out of Joint</b> is Philip K. Dick\u2019s classic depiction\
  \ of the disorienting disparity between the world as we think it is and the world\
  \ as it actually is. The year is 1998, although Ragle Gumm doesn\u2019t know that.\
  \ He thinks it\u2019s 1959. He also thinks that he served in World War II, that\
  \ he lives in a quiet little community, and that he really is the world\u2019s long-standing\
  \ champion of newspaper puzzle contests. It is only after a series of troubling\
  \ hallucinations that he begins to suspect otherwise. And once he pursues his suspicions,\
  \ he begins to see how he is the center of a universe gone terribly awry."
