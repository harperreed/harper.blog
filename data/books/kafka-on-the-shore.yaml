description: "<i>Kafka on the Shore</i>, a tour de force of metaphysical reality,\
  \ is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs\
  \ away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his\
  \ long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never\
  \ recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons\
  \ that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom. Their odyssey,\
  \ as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices\
  \ and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp\
  \ employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged\
  \ since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There\
  \ is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle\u2014\
  yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined\
  \ destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate\
  \ entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own."
