description: "<b>A hilarious spoof on the classic country-house murder mystery, from\
  \ the Russian masters of sci-fi\u2014never before translated</b><br /> \_<br />\
  \ When Inspector Peter Glebsky arrives at the remote ski chalet on vacation, the\
  \ last thing he intends to do is get involved in any police work. He\u2019s there\
  \ to ski, drink brandy, and loaf around in blissful solitude.<br /> \_<br /> But\
  \ he hadn\u2019t counted on the other vacationers, an eccentric bunch including\
  \ a famous hypnotist, a physicist with a penchant for gymnastic feats, a sulky teenager\
  \ of indeterminate gender, and the mysterious Mr. and Mrs. Moses. And as the chalet\
  \ fills up, strange things start happening\u2014things that seem to indicate the\
  \ presence of another, unseen guest. Is there a ghost on the premises? A prankster?\
  \ Something more sinister? And then an avalanche blocks the mountain pass, and they\u2019\
  re stuck.<br /> \_<br /> Which is just about when they find the corpse. Meaning\
  \ that Glebksy\u2019s vacation is over and he\u2019s embarked on the most unusual\
  \ investigation he\u2019s ever been involved with. In fact, the further he looks\
  \ into it, the more Glebsky realizes that the victim may not even be human.<br />\
  \ \_<br /> In this late novel from the legendary Russian sci-fi duo\u2014here in\
  \ its first-ever English translation\u2014the Strugatskys gleefully upend the plot\
  \ of many a Hercule Poirot mystery\u2014and the result is much funnier, and much\
  \ stranger, than anything Agatha Christie ever wrote.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the\
  \ Trade Paperback edition.</i>"
