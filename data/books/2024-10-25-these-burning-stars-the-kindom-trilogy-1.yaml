description: "A dangerous cat-and-mouse quest for revenge. An empire that spans star\
  \ systems, built on the bones of a genocide. A carefully hidden secret that could\
  \ collapse worlds, hunted by three women with secrets of their own. All collide\
  \ in this twisty, explosive space opera debut, perfect for readers of Arkady Martine\
  \ and Kameron Hurley.<br /><br />Jun Ironway\u2014hacker, con artist, and occasional\
  \ thief\u2014has gotten her hands on a piece of contraband that could set her up\
  \ for proof that implicates the powerful Nightfoot family in a planet-wide genocide\
  \ seventy-five years ago. The Nightfoots control the precious sevite that fuels\
  \ interplanetary travel through three star systems. And someone is sure to pay handsomely\
  \ for anything that could break their hold.<br /><br />Of course, anything valuable\
  \ is also dangerous. The Kindom, the ruling power of the star systems, is inextricably\
  \ tied up in the Nightfoots\u2019 monopoly\u2014and they can\u2019t afford to let\
  \ Jun expose the truth. They task two of their most brutal clerics with hunting\
  \ her preternaturally stoic Chono, and brilliant hothead Esek, who also happens\
  \ to be the heir to the Nightfoot empire.<br /><br />But Chono and Esek are haunted\
  \ in turn by a figure from their shared past, known only as Six. What Six truly\
  \ wants is anyone\u2019s guess. And the closer they get to finding Jun, the surer\
  \ Chono is that Six is manipulating them all.<br /><br />\u200BIt's a game that\
