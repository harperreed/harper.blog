description: "An extraordinary insight into life under one of the world\u2019s most\
  \ ruthless and secretive dictatorships \u2013 and the story of one woman\u2019s\
  \ terrifying struggle to avoid capture/repatriation and guide her family to freedom.<br\
  \ /><br />As a child growing up in North Korea, Hyeonseo Lee was one of millions\
  \ trapped by a secretive and brutal totalitarian regime. Her home on the border\
  \ with China gave her some exposure to the world beyond the confines of the Hermit\
  \ Kingdom and, as the famine of the 1990s struck, she began to wonder, question\
  \ and to realise that she had been brainwashed her entire life. Given the repression,\
  \ poverty and starvation she witnessed surely her country could not be, as she had\
  \ been told \u201Cthe best on the planet\u201D?<br /><br />Aged seventeen, she decided\
  \ to escape North Korea. She could not have imagined that it would be twelve years\
  \ before she was reunited with her family.<br /><br />She could not return, since\
  \ rumours of her escape were spreading, and she and her family could incur the punishments\
  \ of the government authorities \u2013 involving imprisonment, torture, and possible\
  \ public execution. Hyeonseo instead remained in China and rapidly learned Chinese\
  \ in an effort to adapt and survive. Twelve years and two lifetimes later, she would\
  \ return to the North Korean border in a daring mission to spirit her mother and\
  \ brother to South Korea, on one of the most arduous, costly and dangerous journeys\
  \ imaginable.<br /><br />This is the unique story not only of Hyeonseo\u2019s escape\
  \ from the darkness into the light, but also of her coming of age, education and\
  \ the resolve she found to rebuild her life \u2013 not once, but twice \u2013 first\
  \ in China, then in South Korea. Strong, brave and eloquent, this memoir is a triumph\
  \ of her remarkable spirit."
