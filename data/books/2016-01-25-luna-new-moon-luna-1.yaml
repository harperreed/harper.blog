description: The Moon wants to kill you. Whether it's being unable to pay your per
  diem for your allotted food, water, and air, or you just get caught up in a fight
  between the Moon's ruling corporations, the Five Dragons. You must fight for every
  inch you want to gain in the Moon's near feudal society. And that is just what Adriana
  Corta did.<br /><br />As the leader of the Moon's newest "dragon," Adriana has wrested
  control of the Moon's Helium-3 industry from the Mackenzie Metal corporation and
  fought to earn her family's new status. Now, at the twilight of her life, Adriana
  finds her corporation, Corta Helio, surrounded by the many enemies she made during
  her meteoric rise. If the Corta family is to survive, Adriana's five children must
  defend their mother's empire from her many enemies... and each other.

      description: "The Moon only looks peaceful from afar. On its unstable surface,\
        \ competition is fierce among the Five Dragons--the five families that control\
        \ the Moon's leading industrial corporations. In the vicious political atmosphere,\
        \ each clan does everything to gain an advantage over the others: marriages\
        \ of convenience, espionage, kidnapping, and assassinations. It is nothing\
        \ less than corporate warfare....and the newest of the Five is about to launch\
        \ a new campaign. \n    \n    With \"a feel of <i>The Godfather</i> meets\
        \ A Song of Ice and Fire meets <i>Ender's Game</i>\" (Portland Book Review),\
        \ Ian McDonald's near-future space opera series has earned praise and acclaim.\
        \ Both <i>Luna: New Moon</i> and <i>Luna: Wolf Moon</i> received starred reviews\
        \ from <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, and <i>Luna: Wolf Moon</i> was named an NPR\
        \ Best Book of the Year.\n    \n    <i>The Falls: A Luna Story</i> and <i>The\
        \ Menace from Farside </i> are side-stories set in the Luna universe but featuring\
        \ different characters.\n    \n    <i>The Fifth Dragon</i> is a novelette\
        \ which was integrated, in slightly modified form, into the novel <i>Luna:\
        \ New Moon</i>."
