  \ </i>to that of <i>Mr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore</i>. It\u2019s all one\
  \ Penumbraverse.<br /><br /></b>James Bascule is adrift. College beckons\u2014but\
  \ not quite strongly enough to actually get him to campus. A trip to Europe showed\
  \ him a world bigger than his Northern California upbringing\u2014and yet, one broken\
  \ heart later, Northern California is where he\u2019s returned. Back to his old\
  \ bedroom, paying his bemused parents rent with his new hobby, baking bread with\
  \ the sourdough starter that is his only souvenir of what was apparently just a\
  \ summer fling.<br /><br />The future is being built an hour or two down the highway\u2014\
  it\u2019s 1985; the twenty-first century is just around the corner!\u2014but that\u2019\
  s not his world either. While sitting in a Sonoma County bar, indulging in a little\
  \ aimless day drinking with a junior college acquaintance, he meets a man. A man\
  \ with . . . something like a plan. Has James ever heard of a \u201Csuitcase clone\u201D\
  ? It\u2019s a cutting of a vine used to clone and propagate noteworthy grapes\u2014\
  say, from a legendary European vineyard to an upstart Napa Valley operation. This\
  \ man has an operation. He has a suitcase. He just needs an enterprising young accomplice\
  \ up for an adventure.<br /><br />Just how deliriously fun and thrillingly mind-expanding\
  \ an adventure, James can\u2019t yet know. But we, of course, know how Robin Sloan\
  \ crafts a story. Crossing the international literary-techno-conspiracy of <i>Mr.\
  \ Penumbra</i> with the delicious experimentation of <i>Sourdough</i>, <i>The Suitcase\
  \ Clone</i> is a tale that enriches and expands the Penumbraverse in ways you never\
  \ saw coming, told by a mysterious narrator with an unexpected perspective on the\
  \ great puzzles of life. Who could it be?"
