description: <strong>A full-speed-ahead oral history of the nearly two-decade making
  of the cultural phenomenon <em>Mad Fury Road</em>--with more than 130 new interviews
  with key members of the cast and crew, including Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy, and
  director George Miller, from the pop culture reporter for <em>The New York Times</em>,
  Kyle Buchanan.</strong><br /><br />It won six Oscars and has been hailed as the
  greatest action film ever, but it is a miracle <em>Mad Fury Road</em> ever made
  it to the screen... or that anybody survived the production. The story of this modern
  classic spanned nearly two decades of wild obstacles as visionary director George
  Miller tried to mount one of the most difficult shoots in Hollywood history.<br
  /><br />Production stalled several times, stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron clashed
  repeatedly in the brutal Namib Desert, and Miller's crew engineered death-defying
  action scenes that were among the most dangerous ever committed to film. Even accomplished
  Hollywood figures are flummoxed by the As the director Steven Soderbergh has said,
  "I don't understand how they're not still shooting that film, and I don't understand
  how hundreds of people aren't dead."<br /><br />Kyle Buchanan takes readers through
  every step of that moviemaking experience in vivid detail, from <em>Fury Road</em>'s
  unexpected origins through its outlandish casting process to the big-studio battles
  that nearly mutilated a masterpiece. But he takes the deepest dive in reporting
  the astonishing facts behind a shoot so unconventional that the film's fantasy world
  began to bleed into the real lives of its cast and crew. As they fought and endured
  in a wasteland of their own, the only way forward was to have faith in their director's
  mad vision. But how could Miller persevere when almost everything seemed to be stacked
  against him?<br /><br />With hundreds of exclusive interviews and details about
  the making of <em>Fury Road</em>, readers will be left with one undeniable There
  has never been a movie so drenched in sweat, so forged by fire, and so epic in scope.
