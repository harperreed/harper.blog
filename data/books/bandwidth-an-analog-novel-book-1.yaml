description: "<b>\u201CA future we can all recognize\u2014and one that we should all\
  \ be genuinely afraid of.\u201D \u2014<i>Ars Technica</i> on <i>Cumulus</i></b><br\
  \ /><br />A rising star at a preeminent political lobbying firm, Dag Calhoun represents\
  \ the world\u2019s most powerful technology and energy executives. But when a close\
  \ brush with death reveals that the influence he wields makes him a target, impossible\
  \ cracks appear in his perfect, richly appointed life.<br /><br />Like everyone\
  \ else, Dag relies on his digital feed for everything\u2014a feed that is as personal\
  \ as it is pervasive, and may not be as private as it seems. As he struggles to\
  \ make sense of the dark forces closing in on him, he discovers that activists are\
  \ hijacking the feed to manipulate markets and governments. Going public would destroy\
  \ everything he\u2019s worked so hard to build, but it\u2019s not just Dag\u2019\
  s life on the line\u2014a shadow war is coming, one that will secure humanity\u2019\
  s future or doom the planet to climate catastrophe. Ultimately, Dag must decide\
  \ the price he\u2019s willing to pay to change the world."
