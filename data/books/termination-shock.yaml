description: "<strong>A visionary technothriller about climate change.</strong><br\
  \ /><br />Neal Stephenson\u2019s sweeping, prescient new novel transports readers\
  \ to a near-future world where the greenhouse effect has inexorably resulted in\
  \ a whirling-dervish troposphere of superstorms, rising sea levels, global flooding,\
  \ merciless heat waves, and virulent, deadly pandemics.<br /><br />One man has a\
  \ Big Idea for reversing global warming, a master plan perhaps best described as\
  \ \u201Celemental.\u201D But will it work? And just as important, what are the consequences\
  \ for the planet and all of humanity should it be applied?<br /><br />Ranging from\
  \ the Texas heartland to the Dutch royal palace in the Hague, from the snow-capped\
  \ peaks of the Himalayas to the sunbaked Chihuahuan Desert, Termination Shock brings\
  \ together a disparate group of characters from different cultures and continents\
  \ who grapple with the real-life repercussions of global warming. Ultimately, it\
  \ asks the question: Might the cure be worse than the disease?"
