description: In a theocratic world far into the future, cities control their own movements
  and organization. Constantly moving, growing and decaying, taking care of every
  need their inhabitants might think of, the cities have decided that humans are no
  longer a necessary part of their architecture, casting them out to wander in the
  wilderness and eke out a meager subsistence. To the exiled humans, the cities represent
  a paradisiacal Eden, a reminder of all they cannot attain due to their sinful and
  unworthy natures. But things are beginning to change. People are no longer willing
  to allow the cities to keep them out, choosing instead to force an entry and plunder
  at will. The cities are starting to crumble and die because they have no purpose
  or reason to continue living without citizens. One woman, called mad by some and
  wise by others, is the only human allowed to inhabit a city. From her lonely and
  precarious position at the heart of one of the greatest cities ever, she must decide
  the fate of the relationship between human society and the ancient strongholds of
  knowledge, while making one last desperate attempt to save the living cities.
