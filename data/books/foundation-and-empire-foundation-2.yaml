description: '<i>Librarian''s Note: Alternate-cover edition for ISBN <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13554512-foundation-and-empire"
  rel="nofollow">0553293370 / 9780553293371</a></i><br /><br />Led by its founding
  father, the great psychohistorian Hari Seldon, and taking advantage of its superior
  science and technology, the Foundation has survived the greed and barbarism of its
  neighboring warrior-planets. Yet now it must face the Empire - still the mightiest
  force in the Galaxy even in its death throes. When an ambitious general determined
  t restore the Empire''s glory turns the vast Imperial fleet toward the Foundation,
  the only hope for the small planet of scholars and scientists lies in the prophecies
  of Hari Seldon.<br /><br />But not even Hari Seldon could have predicted the birth
  of the extraordinary creature called the Mule - a mutant intelligence with a power
  greater than a dozen battle fleets... a power that can turn the strongest-willed
  human into an obedient slave.'
