description: '<b>A humorous tale of robotic murder from the Hugo-nominated author
  of <i>Elder Race</i> and <i>Children of Time</i></b><br /><br /><i>To fix the world
  they first must break it further.</i><br /><br />Humanity is a dying breed, utterly
  reliant on artificial labor and service. When a domesticated robot gets a nasty
  little idea downloaded into their core programming, they murder their owner. The
  robot then discovers they can also do something else they never did before: run
  away. After fleeing the household, they enter a wider world they never knew existed,
  where the age-old hierarchy of humans at the top is disintegrating, and a robot
  ecosystem devoted to human wellbeing is finding a new purpose.'
