description: In 2019, humanity finally finds proof of extraterrestrial life when a
  listening post in Puerto Rico picks up exquisite singing from a planet which will
  come to be known as Rakhat. While United Nations diplomats endlessly debate a possible
  first contact mission, the Society of Jesus quietly organizes an eight-person scientific
  expedition of its own. What the Jesuits find is a world so beyond comprehension
  that it will lead them to question the meaning of being "human." When the lone survivor
  of the expedition, Emilio Sandoz, returns to Earth in 2059, he will try to explain
  what went wrong... Words like "provocative" and "compelling" will come to mind as
  you read this shocking novel about first contact with a race that creates music
  akin to both poetry and prayer.
