description: "From the author of the critically acclaimed Inspector O series comes\
  \ another riveting novel set in the mysterious world of North Korea<br />\_<br />Autumn\
  \ brings unwelcome news to Inspector O: he has been wrenched from retirement and\
  \ ordered back to Pyongyang for a final assignment. The two Koreas, he learns, are\
  \ now cooperating\u2014very quietly\u2014to maintain stability in the North. Stability\
  \ requires that Inspector O lead an investigation into a crime of passion committed\
  \ by the young man who has been selected as the best possible leader of a transition\
  \ government. O is instructed to make sure that the case goes away. Remnants of\
  \ the old regime, foreign powers, rival gangs\u2014all want a piece of the action,\
  \ and all make it clear that if O values his life, he will not get in their way.\
  \ O isn\u2019t sure where his loyalties lie, and he doesn\u2019t have much time\
  \ to figure out whether \u2018tis better to be noble or be dead."
