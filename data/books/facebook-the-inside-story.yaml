description: "<b>From renowned tech writer Steven Levy, the definitive history of\
  \ one of America's most powerful and controversial companies: Facebook</b><br />\
  \ \_<br /> In his sophomore year of college, Mark Zuckerberg created a simple website\
  \ to serve as a campus social network. The site caught on like wildfire, and soon\
  \ students nationwide were on Facebook.<br /><br /> Today, Facebook is nearly unrecognizable\
  \ from Zuckerberg's first, modest iteration. It has grown into a tech giant, the\
  \ largest social media platform and one of the most gargantuan companies in the\
  \ world, with a valuation of more than $576 billion and almost 3 billion users.\
  \ There is no denying the power and omnipresence of Facebook in American daily life.\
  \ And in light of recent controversies surrounding election-influencing \"fake news\"\
  \ accounts, the handling of its users' personal data, and growing discontent with\
  \ the actions of its founder and CEO, never has the company been more central to\
  \ the national conversation.\_<br /><br /> Based on years of exclusive reporting\
  \ and interviews with Facebook's key executives and employees, including Mark Zuckerberg\
  \ and Sheryl Sandberg, Steven Levy's sweeping narrative digs deep into the whole\
  \ story of the company that has changed the world and reaped the consequences."
