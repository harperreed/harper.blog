description: "The mind-blowing new thriller from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling\
  \ author of <i>Dark Matter</i> and <i>Recursion</i> <br /><br /><i>\u201CYou are\
  \ the next step in human evolution.\u201D</i> <br /><br />At first, Logan Ramsay\
  \ isn\u2019t sure if anything\u2019s different. He just feels a little . . . sharper.\
  \ Better able to concentrate. Better at multitasking. Reading a bit faster, memorizing\
  \ better, needing less sleep. <br /><br />But before long, he can\u2019t deny it:\
  \ Something\u2019s happening to his brain. To his body. He\u2019s starting to see\
  \ the world, and those around him\u2014even those he loves most\u2014in whole new\
  \ ways. <br /><br />The truth is, Logan\u2019s genome has been hacked. And there\u2019\
  s a reason he\u2019s been targeted for this upgrade. A reason that goes back decades\
  \ to the darkest part of his past, and a horrific family legacy. <br /><br />Worse\
  \ still, what\u2019s happening to him is just the first step in a much larger plan,\
  \ one that will inflict the same changes on humanity at large\u2014at a terrifying\
  \ cost. <br /><br />Because of his new abilities, Logan\u2019s the one person in\
  \ the world capable of stopping what\u2019s been set in motion. But to have a chance\
  \ at winning this war, he\u2019ll have to become something other than himself. Maybe\
  \ even something other than human. <br /><br />And even as he\u2019s fighting, he\
  \ can\u2019t help wondering: what if humanity\u2019s only hope for a future really\
  \ does lie in engineering our own evolution? <br /><br />Intimate in scale yet epic\
  \ in scope, <i>Upgrade</i> is an intricately plotted, lightning-fast tale that charts\
  \ one man\u2019s thrilling transformation, even as it asks us to ponder the limits\
  \ of our humanity\u2014and our boundless potential."
