description: "<b>The new novel from the international bestselling author of the Wool\
  \ trilogy.</b><br /><br />The old world is buried. A new one has been forged atop\
  \ the shifting dunes. Here in this land of howling wind and infernal sand, four\
  \ siblings find themselves scattered and lost.<br /><br />Palmer has never been\
  \ the same since his father walked out twelve years ago. His elder sister, Vic,\
  \ is trying to run away from the past; his younger brothers, Connor and Rob, are\
  \ risking their lives to embrace it. His mother, left with nothing but anger, is\
  \ just trying to forget.<br /><br />Palmer wants to prove his worth, not only to\
  \ his family, but to himself. And in the barren, dune-covered landscape of his home,\
  \ there is only one way to earn respect: sand-diving. Plunging deep below the desert\
  \ floor in search of relics and scraps of the old world. He is about to embark on\
  \ the most dangerous dive of his young life, aiming to become the first to discover\
  \ the rumoured city below.<br /><br />Deep within the sand lies the key to bringing\
  \ his family together \u2013 and tearing their world apart."
