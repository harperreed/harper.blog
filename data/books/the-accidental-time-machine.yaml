description: Joe Haldeman "has quietly become one of the most important science fiction
  writers of our time" (<i>Rocky Mountain News</i>). Now he delivers a provocative
  novel of a man who stumbles upon the discovery of a lifetime-or many lifetimes.
  <br /><br /> Grad-school dropout Matt Fuller is toiling as a lowly research assistant
  at MIT when, while measuring subtle quantum forces that relate to time changes in
  gravity and electromagnetic force, his calibrator turns into a time machine. With
  a dead-end job and a girlfriend who has left him for another man, Matt has nothing
  to lose taking a time machine trip himself-or so he thinks.
