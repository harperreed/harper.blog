description: 'Once in a great while a science fiction story is so visionary, yet so
  close to impending scientific developments that it becomes not only an accurate
  predictor, but itself the locus for new discoveries and development. True Names
  by Vernor Vinge, first published in 1981, is such a work.<br /><br />Here is a feast
  of articles by computer scientists and journalists on the cutting edge of the field,
  writing about innovations and developments of the Internet, including, among others:<br
  /><br />Danny Hillis: Founder of thinking machines and the first Disney Fellow.<br
  /><br />Timothy C. May: former chief scientist at Intel--a major insider in the
  field of computers and technology.<br /><br />Marvin Minsky: Cofounder of the MIT
  Artificial Intelligence Lab.<br /><br />Chip Morningstar and F. Randall Farmer:
  Codevelopers of habitat, the first real computer interactive environment.<br /><br
  />Mark Pesce: Cocreator of VRML and the author of the <i>Playful World: How Technology
  Transforms Our Imagination.</i><br /><br />Richard M. Stallman: Research affiliate
  with MIT; the founder of the Free Software Movement.'
