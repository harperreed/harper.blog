description: "<b>Robin Sloan expands the Penumbraverse to new reaches of time and\
  \ space in a rollicking far-future adventure.</b><br /><br />In <i>Moonbound</i>,\
  \ Robin Sloan has written a novel with the full scope and ambitious imagination\
  \ of the very books that lit the engines of <i>Mr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore</i>:\
  \ an epic quest as only Sloan could conceive it, mixing science fiction, fantasy,\
  \ good old-fashioned literary storytelling, and unrivaled enthusiasm for what\u2019\
  s next.<br /><br />It is thirteen thousand years from now . . . A lot has happened,\
  \ and yet a lot is still very familiar. Ariel is a boy in a small town under a wizard\u2019\
  s rule. Like many adventurers before him, Ariel is called to explore a world full\
  \ of unimaginable glories and unknown enemies, a mission to save the world, a girl.\
  \ Here, as they say, be dragons. But none of this happens before Ariel comes across\
  \ an artifact from an earlier civilization, a sentient, record-keeping artificial\
  \ intelligence that carries with it the perspective of the whole of human history\u2015\
  and becomes both Ariel\u2019s greatest ally and the narrator of our story.<br /><br\
  \ /><i>Moonbound</i> is an adventure into the richest depths of Story itself. It\
  \ is a deeply satisfying epic of ancient scale, blasted through the imaginative\
  \ prism one of our most forward-thinking writers. And this is only the beginning."
