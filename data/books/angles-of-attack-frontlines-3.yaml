description: "<p>The alien forces known as the Lankies are gathering on the solar\
  \ system\u2019s edge, consolidating their conquest of Mars and setting their sights\
  \ on Earth. The far-off colony of New Svalbard, cut off from the rest of the galaxy\
  \ by the Lanky blockade, teeters on the verge of starvation and collapse. The forces\
  \ of the two Earth alliances have won minor skirmishes but are in danger of losing\
  \ the war. For battle-weary staff sergeant Andrew Grayson and the ragged forces\
  \ of the North American Commonwealth, the fight for survival is entering a catastrophic\
  \ new phase.</p><p>Forging an uneasy alliance with their Sino-Russian enemies, the\
  \ NAC launches a hybrid task force on a long shot: a stealth mission to breach the\
  \ Lanky blockade and reestablish supply lines with Earth. Plunging into combat against\
  \ a merciless alien species that outguns, outmaneuvers, and outfights them at every\
  \ turn, Andrew and his fellow troopers could end up cornered on their home turf,\
  \ with no way out and no hope for reinforcement. And this time, the struggle for\
  \ humanity\u2019s future can only end in either victory or annihilation.</p>"
