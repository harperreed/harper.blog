description: "<b>An audacious, darkly glittering novel set in the eerie days of civilization\u2019\
  s collapse, Station Eleven tells the spellbinding story of a Hollywood star, his\
  \ would-be savior, and a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts\
  \ of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity. <br /><br\
  \ />A National Book Award Finalist<br />A PEN/Faulkner Award Finalist</b><br /><br\
  \ />Kirsten Raymonde will never forget the night Arthur Leander, the famous Hollywood\
  \ actor, had a heart attack on stage during a production of King Lear. That was\
  \ the night when a devastating flu pandemic arrived in the city, and within weeks,\
  \ civilization as we know it came to an end.<br /><br />Twenty years later, Kirsten\
  \ moves between the settlements of the altered world with a small troupe of actors\
  \ and musicians. They call themselves The Traveling Symphony, and they have dedicated\
  \ themselves to keeping the remnants of art and humanity alive. But when they arrive\
  \ in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who will threaten\
  \ the tiny band\u2019s existence. And as the story takes off, moving back and forth\
  \ in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, the strange\
  \ twist of fate that connects them all will be revealed."
