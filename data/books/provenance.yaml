description: Following her record-breaking debut trilogy, Ann Leckie, winner of the
  Hugo, Nebula, Arthur C. Clarke, and Locus Awards, returns with an enthralling new
  novel of power, theft, privilege, and birthright.<br /><br />A power-driven young
  woman has just one chance to secure the status she craves and regain priceless lost
  artifacts prized by her people. She must free their thief from a prison planet from
  which no one has ever returned.<br /><br />Ingray and her charge will return to
  her home world to find their planet in political turmoil, at the heart of an escalating
  interstellar conflict. Together, they must make a new plan to salvage Ingray's future,
  her family, and her world before they are lost to her for good.
