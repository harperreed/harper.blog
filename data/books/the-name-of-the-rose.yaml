description: "The year is 1327. Benedictines in a wealthy Italian abbey are suspected\
  \ of heresy, and Brother William of Baskerville arrives to investigate. When his\
  \ delicate mission is suddenly overshadowed by seven bizarre deaths, Brother William\
  \ turns detective. His tools are the logic of Aristotle, the theology of Aquinas,\
  \ the empirical insights of Roger Bacon\u2014all sharpened to a glistening edge\
  \ by wry humor and a ferocious curiosity. He collects evidence, deciphers secret\
  \ symbols and coded manuscripts, and digs into the eerie labyrinth of the abbey,\
  \ where \u201Cthe most interesting things happen at night.\u201D"
