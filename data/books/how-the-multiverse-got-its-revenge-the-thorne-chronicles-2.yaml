description: "<b>Rory Thorne must use the fairy blessings gifted to her to change\
  \ the multiverse in the second book in this space opera duology.</b><br /><br />After\
  \ avoiding an arranged marriage, thwarting a coup, and inadvertently kick-starting\
  \ a revolution, Rory Thorne has renounced her title and embraced an unglamorous\
  \ life as a privateer on the edge of human space.<br /><br />Her new life is interrupted\
  \ when Rory and her crew\u2013former royal bodyguards, Thorsdottir and Zhang, and\
  \ co-conspirator Jaed\u2013encounter an abandoned ship registered under a false\
  \ name, seemingly fallen victim to attack. As they investigate, they find evidence\
  \ of vicious technology and arithmancy, alien and far beyond known capabilities.<br\
  \ /><br />The only answer to all the destruction is the mysterious, and unexpected,\
  \ cargo: a rose plant. One that reveals themself to be sentient\u2013and designed\
  \ as a massive biological weapon. Rose seeks to escape their intended fate, but\
  \ before Rory and her friends can get Rose off the derelict ship, the alien attackers\
  \ return.<br /><br />Rory and her friends must act fast\u2013and wisely\u2013to\
  \ save themselves, and Rose, and maybe the multiverse, too, from a war humanity\
  \ cannot win."
