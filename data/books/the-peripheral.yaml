description: "<b>William Gibson returns with his first novel since 2010\u2019s<i>\
  \ New York Times</i>\u2013bestselling <i>Zero History</i>.</b><br /><br /><br />\
  \ Where Flynne and her brother, Burton, live, jobs outside the drug business are\
  \ rare. Fortunately, Burton has his veteran\u2019s benefits, for neural damage he\
  \ suffered from implants during his time in the USMC\u2019s elite Haptic Recon force.\
  \ Then one night Burton has to go out, but there\u2019s a job he\u2019s supposed\
  \ to do\u2014a job Flynne didn\u2019t know he had. Beta-testing part of a new game,\
  \ he tells her. The job seems to be simple: work a perimeter around the image of\
  \ a tower building. Little buglike things turn up. He\u2019s supposed to get in\
  \ their way, edge them back. That\u2019s all there is to it. He\u2019s offering\
  \ Flynne a good price to take over for him. What she sees, though, isn\u2019t what\
  \ Burton told her to expect. It might be a game, but it might also be murder. <br\
