        \ present-day teenager who discovers that everything she believes about herself\
        \ is wrong\u2014that she is not, in fact, human, or from Earth. That, in fact,\
        \ she has a critical role to play in an interstellar drama involving many\
        \ contending alien species and a long and complex history of politics, diplomacy\
        \ and warfare among them. That she carries within herself the memories and\
        \ abilities of a now-deceased warrior leader of her true species, deliberately\
        \ implanted in her for safekeeping. It is a tale of the heart of adolescence:\
        \ vast power and knowledge yoked to a vulnerable young consciousness that\u2019\
        s just now learning, in fits and starts and with repeated failures and setbacks,\
        \ how to be a person.\n\n"
