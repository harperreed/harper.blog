description: "<i>I\u2019m embarrassed, still, by how long it took me to notice. Everything\
  \ was right there in the open, right there in front of me, but it still took me\
  \ so long to see the person I had married.<br /><br />It took me so long to hate\
  \ him.</i><br /><br />Martine is a genetically cloned replica made from Evelyn Caldwell\u2019\
  s award-winning research. She\u2019s patient and gentle and obedient. She\u2019\
  s everything Evelyn swore she\u2019d never be.<br /><br />And she\u2019s having\
  \ an affair with Evelyn\u2019s husband.<br /><br />Now, the cheating bastard is\
  \ dead, and both Caldwell wives have a mess to clean up.<br /><br />Good thing Evelyn\
  \ Caldwell is used to getting her hands dirty."
