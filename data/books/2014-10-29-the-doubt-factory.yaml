description: In this page-turning contemporary thriller, National Book Award Finalist
  and "New York Times" bestselling author Paolo Bacigalupi explores the timely issue
  of how public information is distorted for monetary gain, and how those who exploit
  it must be stopped.<br />Everything Alix knows about her life is a lie. At least
  that's what a mysterious young man who's "stalking" her keeps saying. But then she
  begins investigating the disturbing claims he makes against her father. Could her
  dad really be at the helm of a firm that distorts the truth and covers up wrongdoing
  by hugely profitable corporations that have allowed innocent victims to die? Is
  it possible that her father is the bad guy, and that the undeniably alluring criminal
  who calls himself Moses--and his radical band of teen activists--is right? Alix
  has to make a choice, and time is running out, but can she truly risk everything
  and blow the whistle on the man who loves her and raised her?
