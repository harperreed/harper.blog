description: "Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s first novel spins the chilling tale of engineer\
  \ Paul Proteus, who must find a way to live in a world dominated by a supercomputer\
  \ and run completely by machines. Paul\u2019s rebellion is vintage Vonnegut\u2014\
  wildly funny, deadly serious, and terrifyingly close to reality."
