description: "<b>From the author of national bestseller <i>The Book of Speculation</i>,\
  \ a poignant, fantastical novel about the electric combination of ambition &amp;\
  \ wonder that keeps us reaching toward the heavens.</b><br /><br />Eleven-year-old\
  \ Nedda Papas is obsessed with becoming an astronaut. In 1986 in Easter, a small\
  \ Florida Space Coast town, her dreams seem almost within reach\u2014if she can\
  \ just grow up fast enough. Theo, the scientist father she idolizes, is consumed\
  \ by his own obsessions. Laid off from his job at NASA and still reeling from the\
  \ loss of Nedda\u2019s newborn brother several years before, Theo turns to the dangerous\
  \ dream of extending his living daughter's childhood just a little longer. The result\
  \ is an invention that alters the fabric of time.<br /><br />Amidst the chaos that\
  \ erupts, Nedda must confront her father and his secrets, the ramifications of which\
  \ will irrevocably change her life, her community, and the entire world. But she\
  \ finds an unexpected ally in Betheen, the mother she\u2019s never quite understood,\
  \ who surprises Nedda by seeing her more clearly than anyone else. <br /><br />Decades\
  \ later, Nedda has achieved her long-held dream, and as she floats in antigravity,\
  \ far from earth, she and her crewmates face a serious crisis. Nedda may hold the\
  \ key to the solution, if she can come to terms with her past and the future that\
  \ awaits her. <br /><br /><i>Light from Other Stars</i> is about fathers and daughters,\
  \ women and the forces that hold them back, and the cost of meaningful work. It\
  \ questions how our lives have changed, what progress looks like, and what it really\
  \ means to sacrifice for the greater good."
