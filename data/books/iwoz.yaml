description: "The mastermind behind Apple sheds his low profile and steps forward\
  \ to tell his story for the first time.<br /><br />Before cell phones that fit in\
  \ the palm of your hand and slim laptops that fit snugly into briefcases, computers\
  \ were like strange, alien vending machines. They had cryptic switches, punch cards\
  \ and pages of encoded output. But in 1975, a young engineering wizard named Steve\
  \ Wozniak had an idea: What if you combined computer circuitry with a regular typewriter\
  \ keyboard and a video screen? The result was the first true personal computer,\
  \ the Apple I, a widely affordable machine that anyone could understand and figure\
  \ out how to use.<br /><br />Wozniak's life\x97before and after Apple\x97is a \"\
  home-brew\" mix of brilliant discovery and adventure, as an engineer, a concert\
  \ promoter, a fifth-grade teacher, a philanthropist, and an irrepressible prankster.\
  \ From the invention of the first personal computer to the rise of Apple as an industry\
  \ giant, <i>iWoz</i> presents a no-holds-barred, rollicking, firsthand account of\
  \ the humanist inventor who ignited the computer revolution."
