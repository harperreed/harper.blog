description: "William Gibson, author of the extraordinary multiaward-winning novel\
  \ <i>Neuromancer</i>, has written his most brilliant and thrilling work to date...\
  \ <i>The Mona Lisa Overdrive</i>.\_Enter Gibson's unique world - lyric and mechanical,\
  \ erotic and violent, sobering and exciting - where multinational corporations and\
  \ high tech outlaws vie for power, traveling into the computer-generated universe\
  \ known as cyberspace.\_Into this world comes Mona, a young girl with a murky past\
  \ and an uncertain future whose life is on a collision course with internationally\
  \ famous Sense/Net star Angie Mitchell.\_Since childhood, Angie has been able to\
  \ tap into cyberspace <i>without</i> a computer.\_Now, from inside cyberspace, a\
  \ kidnapping plot is masterminded by a phantom entity who has plans for Mona, Angie,\
  \ and all humanity, plans that cannot be controlled... or even known.\_And behind\
  \ the intrigue lurks the shadowy Yakuza, the powerful Japanese underworld, whose\
  \ leaders ruthlessly manipulate people and events to suit their own purposes...\
  \ or so they think.<br /><br />"
