description: "Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo,\
  \ is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual\
  \ passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before.\_Toru\
  \ begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there,\
  \ but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable. As she\
  \ retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others\
  \ and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman.<br /><br\
  \ />A poignant story of one college student's romantic coming-of-age, <i>Norwegian\
  \ Wood</i> takes us to that distant place of a young man's first, hopeless, and\
  \ heroic love.<br /><br />"
