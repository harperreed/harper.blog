description: "Kylara Vatta is the only daughter in a family full of sons, and her\
  \ father\u2019s only child to buck tradition by choosing a military career instead\
  \ of joining the family business. For Ky, it\u2019s no contest: Even running the\
  \ prestigious Vatta Transport Ltd. shipping concern can\u2019t hold a candle to\
  \ shipping out as an officer aboard an interstellar cruiser. It\u2019s adventure,\
  \ not commerce, that stirs her soul. And despite her family\u2019s misgivings, there\
  \ can be no doubt that a Vatta in the service will prove a valuable asset. But with\
  \ a single error in judgment, it all comes crumbling down.<br /><br />Expelled from\
  \ the Academy in disgrace\u2013and returning home to her humiliated family, a storm\
  \ of high-profile media coverage, and the gaping void of her own future\u2013Ky\
  \ is ready to face the inevitable onslaught of anger, disappointment, even pity.\
  \ But soon after opportunity\u2019s door slams shut, Ky finds herself with a ticket\
  \ to ride\u2013 and a shot at redemption\u2013as captain of a Vatta Transport ship.<br\
  \ /><br />It\u2019s a simple assignment: escorting one of the Vatta fleet\u2019\
  s oldest ships on its final voyage...to the scrapyard. But keeping it simple has\
  \ never been Ky\u2019s style. And even though her father has provided a crew of\
  \ seasoned veterans to baby-sit the fledgling captain on her maiden milk run, they\
  \ can\u2019t stop Ky from turning the routine mission into a risky venture\u2013\
  in the name of turning a profit for Vatta Transport, of course.<br /><br />By snapping\
  \ up a lucrative delivery contract defaulted on by a rival company, and using part\
  \ of the proceeds to upgrade her condemned vehicle, Ky aims to prove she\u2019s\
  \ got more going for her than just her family\u2019s famous name. But business will\
  \ soon have to take a backseat to bravery, when Ky\u2019s change of plans sails\
