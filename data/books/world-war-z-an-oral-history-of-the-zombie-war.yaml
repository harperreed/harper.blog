description: 'The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks,
  driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the
  survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America
  and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of
  thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He
  recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face
  with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z
  is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully
  conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance,
  that gripped human society through the plague years.<br /><br />Ranging from the
  now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the
  epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed
  northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in
  the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided
  hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where
  the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects
  the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.<br /><br />Most of all, the book
  captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing
  the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage
  on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says
  in his introduction, "By excluding the human factor, aren''t we risking the kind
  of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to
  repeat it? And in the end, isn''t the human factor the only true difference between
  us and the enemy we now refer to as ''the living dead''?"<br /><br />Note: Some
  of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published
  under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.'
