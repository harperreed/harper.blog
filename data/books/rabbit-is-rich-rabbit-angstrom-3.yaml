description: "<b>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the National\
  \ Book Critics Circle Award</b><br /><b>\_</b><br /> The hero of John Updike\u2019\
  s <i>Rabbit, Run,</i> ten years after the events of <i>Rabbit Redux,</i> has come\
  \ to enjoy considerable prosperity as the chief sales representative of Springer\
  \ Motors, a Toyota agency in Brewer, Pennsylvania. The time is 1979: Skylab is falling,\
  \ gas lines are lengthening, and double-digit inflation coincides with a deflation\
  \ of national self-confidence. Nevertheless, Harry \u201CRabbit\u201D Angstrom feels\
  \ in good shape, ready to enjoy life at last\u2014until his wayward son, Nelson,\
  \ returns from the West, and the image of an old love pays a visit to the lot. New\
  \ characters and old populate these scenes from Rabbit\u2019s middle age as he continues\
  \ to pursue, in his zigzagging fashion, the rainbow of happiness."
