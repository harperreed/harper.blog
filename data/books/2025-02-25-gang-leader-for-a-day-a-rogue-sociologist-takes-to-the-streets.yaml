description: "The story of the young sociologist who studied a Chicago crack-dealing\
  \ gang from the inside captured the world's attention when it was first described\
  \ in <i>Freakonomics</i>. <i>Gang Leader for a Day</i> is the fascinating full story\
  \ of how Sudhir Venkatesh managed to gain entr\xE9e into the gang, what he learned,\
  \ and how his method revolutionized the academic establishment.<br /><br />When\
  \ Venkatesh walked into an abandoned building in one of Chicago's most notorious\
  \ housing projects, he was looking for people to take a multiple-choice survey on\
  \ urban poverty. A first-year grad student, he would befriend a gang leader named\
  \ JT and spend the better part of the next decade inside the projects under JT's\
  \ protection, documenting what he saw there.<br /><br />Over the next seven years,\
  \ Venkatesh observed JT and the rest of the gang as they operated their crack selling\
  \ business, conducted PR within their community, and rose up or fell within the\
  \ ranks of the gang's complex organizational structure.<br /><br /><i>Gang Leader\
  \ for a Day</i> is an inside view into the morally ambiguous, highly intricate,\
  \ often corrupt struggle to survive in an urban war zone. It is also the story of\
  \ a complicated friendship between two young and ambitious men, a universe apart."
