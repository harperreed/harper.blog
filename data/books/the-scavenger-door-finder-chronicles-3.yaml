description: From a Hugo Award-winning author comes the third book in this action-packed
  sci-fi caper, starring Fergus Ferguson, interstellar repo man and professional finder.<br
  /><br />Fergus is back on Earth at last, trying to figure out how to live a normal
  life. However, it seems the universe has other plans for him. When his cousin sends
  him off to help out a friend, Fergus accidently stumbles across a piece of an ancient
  alien artifact that some very powerful people seem to think means the entire solar
  system is in danger. And since he found it, they're certain it's also his problem
  to deal with.<br /><br />With the help of his newfound sister, friends both old
  and new, and some enemies, too, Fergus needs to find the rest of the artifact and
  destroy the pieces before anyone can reassemble the original and open a multi-dimensional
  door between Earth and a vast, implacable, alien swarm of devourers. Problem is,
  the pieces could be anywhere on Earth, and he's not the only one out searching.
