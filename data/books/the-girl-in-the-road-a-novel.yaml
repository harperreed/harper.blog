description: "<p><b>Stunningly original and wildly inventive, <i>The Girl in the Road</i>\
  \ melds the influences of Margaret Atwood, Neil Gaiman, and Erin Morgenstern for\
  \ a dazzling debut.</b><br />\_<br />When Meena, a young woman living in a futuristic\
  \ India, gets out of bed with mysterious snake bites on her chest, she decides India\
  \ has become too dangerous. As she plots her exit, she hears of The Trail and knows\
  \ this is her salvation. The Trail is a bridge that spans the Arabian Sea, connecting\
  \ India to Africa like a silver ribbon extending to the horizon.\_ Its purpose is\
  \ to harness the power of the ocean\u2014\u201Cblue energy\u201D\u2014but it also\
  \ offers a sub-culture of travelers a chance for escape and adventure. Meena gathers\
  \ supplies\u2014a pozit GPS system, a scroll reader, a sealable water-proof pod\u2014\
  and embarks on a journey to Ethiopia, the place of her birth.\_ <br />\_<br />\_\
  \_\_\_ Mariama, a girl from a different time, is on a quest of her own. Forced to\
  \ flee her home, she joins up with a caravan of strangers heading across Saharan\
  \ Africa. She meets Yemaya, a beautiful and enigmatic woman who becomes her protector\
  \ and confidante. Yemaya tells Mariama of Ethiopia, where revolution is brewing.\
  \ <br />\_<br />\_\_\_\_ As one heads east and the other west, Meena and Mariama's\
  \ fates will entwine in ways that are profoundly moving and ultimately shocking.\_\
  \ Monica Byrne\u2019s vision of the future is vividly imagined and artfully told\
  \ and she writes with stunning clarity and deep emotion, making <i>The Girl in the\
  \ Road</i> a true tour de force.</p><br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"
