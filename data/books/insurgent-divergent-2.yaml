description: "One choice can transform you\u2014or it can destroy you. But every choice\
  \ has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior\
  \ must continue trying to save those she loves\u2014and herself\u2014while grappling\
  \ with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics\
  \ and love.<br /><br />Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration\
  \ and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors.\
  \ War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And\
  \ in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become\
  \ even more irrevocable\u2014and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions\
  \ but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships,\
  \ Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may\
  \ lose by doing so"
