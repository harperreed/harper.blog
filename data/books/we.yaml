description: '<b>The exhilarating dystopian novel that inspired George Orwell''s 1984
  and foreshadowed the worst excesses of Soviet Russia</b><br /><br />Yevgeny Zamyatin''s
  <i>We</i> is a powerfully inventive vision that has influenced writers from George
  Orwell to Ayn Rand. In a glass-enclosed city of absolute straight lines, ruled over
  by the all-powerful ''Benefactor'', the citizens of the totalitarian society of
  OneState live out lives devoid of passion and creativity - until D-503, a mathematician
  who dreams in numbers, makes a discovery: he has an individual soul. Set in the
  twenty-sixth century AD, <i>We</i> is the classic dystopian novel and was the forerunner
  of works such as George Orwell''s <i>1984</i> and Aldous Huxley''s <i>Brave New
  World</i>. It was suppressed for many years in Russia and remains a resounding cry
  for individual freedom, yet is also a powerful, exciting and vivid work of science
  fiction. Clarence Brown''s brilliant translation is based on the corrected text
  of the novel, first published in Russia in 1988 after more than sixty years'' suppression.'
