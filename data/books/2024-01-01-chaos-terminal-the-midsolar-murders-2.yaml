description: "Mallory Viridian would rather not be an amateur detective, and fled\
  \ to outer space to avoid it\u2026but when one of the new human arrivals on a space\
  \ shuttle is murdered, she\u2019s back in the game.<br /><br />Mallory Viridian\
  \ would rather not be an amateur detective, thank you very much. But no matter what\
  \ she does, people persist in dying around her\u2014and only she seems to be able\
  \ to solve the crime. After fleeing to an alien space station in hopes that the\
  \ lack of humans would stop the murders, a serial killer had the nerve to follow\
  \ her to Station Eternity. (Mallory deduced who the true culprit was that time,\
  \ too.)<br /><br />Now the law enforcement agent who hounded Mallory on Earth has\
  \ come to Station Eternity, along with her teenage crush and his sister, Mallory\u2019\
  s best friend from high school. Mallory doesn\u2019t believe in coincidences, and\
  \ so she\u2019s not at all surprised when someone in the latest shuttle from Earth\
  \ is murdered. It\u2019s the story of her life, after all.<br /><br />Only this\
  \ time she has more than a killer to deal with. Between her fugitive friends, a\
  \ new threat arising from the Sundry hivemind, and the alarmingly peculiar behavior\
  \ of the sentient space station they all call home, even Mallory\u2019s deductive\
  \ abilities are strained. If she can\u2019t find out what\u2019s going on (and fast),\
  \ a disaster of intergalactic proportions may occur.\u2026"
