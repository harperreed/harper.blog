description: "<i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, an American classic, is one of the world\u2019\
  s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden,\
  \ the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year\
  \ struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of\
  \ war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire\
  \ in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber\u2019s son turned draftee\
  \ turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the\
  \ destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel,\
  \ or coming \u201Cunstuck in time.\u201D<br /><br /> An instant bestseller, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>\
  \ made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only\
  \ strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries\
  \ and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut\u2019\
  s writing\u2014the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank\
  \ violence, the transgressive wit\u2014that have inspired generations of readers\
  \ not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence\
  \ to say something about it. <br /><br /> Fifty years after its initial publication\
  \ at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment,\
  \ PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting\
  \ as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era\u2019s uncertainties."
