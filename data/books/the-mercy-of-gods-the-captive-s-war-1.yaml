description: "<b>From the New York Times bestselling author of the Expanse comes a\
  \ spectacular new space opera that sees humanity fighting for its survival in a\
  \ war as old as the universe itself.</b><br /><br /><b>How humanity came to the\
  \ planet called Anjiin is lost in the fog of history, but that history is about\
  \ to end.</b> The Carryx \u2013 part empire, part hive \u2013 have waged wars of\
  \ conquest for centuries, destroying or enslaving species across the galaxy. \_\
  Now, they are facing a great and deathless enemy. The key to their survival may\
  \ rest with the humans of Anjiin. \_ Caught up in academic intrigue and affairs\
  \ of the heart, Dafyd Alkhor is pleased just to be an assistant to a brilliant scientist\
  \ and his celebrated research team. \_Then the Carryx ships descend, decimating\
  \ the human population and taking the best and brightest of Anjiin society away\
  \ to serve on the Carryx homeworld, and Dafyd is swept along with them. They are\
  \ dropped in the middle of a struggle they barely understand, set in a competition\
  \ against the other captive species with extinction as the price of failure. \_\
  Only Dafyd and a handful of his companions see past the Darwinian contest to the\
  \ deeper game that they must play to learning to understand \u2013 and manipulate\
  \ \u2013 the Carryx themselves. With a noble but suicidal human rebellion on one\
  \ hand and strange and murderous enemies on the other, the team pays a terrible\
  \ price to become the trusted servants of their new rulers. Dafyd Alkhor is a simple\
  \ man swept up in events that are beyond his control and more vast than his imagination.\
  \ \_He will become the champion of humanity and its betrayer, the most hated man\
  \ in history and the guardian of his people. This is where his story begins."
