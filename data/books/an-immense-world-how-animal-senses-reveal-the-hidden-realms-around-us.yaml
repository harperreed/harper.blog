description: <b><br />Enter a new dimension - the world as it is truly perceived by
  other animals.</b><br /><br />The Earth teems with sights and textures, sounds and
  vibrations, smells and tastes, electric and magnetic fields. But every animal is
  enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving only a tiny sliver of
  an immense world. This book welcomes us into previously unfathomable dimensions
  - the world as it is truly perceived by other animals.<br /><br />We encounter beetles
  that are drawn to fires, turtles that can track the Earth's magnetic fields, fish
  that fill rivers with electrical messages, and humans that wield sonar like bats.
  We discover that a crocodile's scaly face is as sensitive as a lover's fingertips,
  that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs, and that even simple
  scallops have complex vision.<br /><br />We learn what bees see in flowers, what
  songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street. We listen to stories
  of pivotal discoveries in the field, while looking ahead at the many mysteries which
  lie unsolved.<br /><br />Ed Yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses,
  allowing us to perceive the threads of scent, waves of electromagnetism and pulses
  of pressure that surround us. Because in order to understand our world we don't
  need to travel to other places; we need to see through other eyes.
