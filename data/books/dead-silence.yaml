description: "<b><i>Titanic</i> meets <i>The Shining</i> in S.A. Barnes\u2019 Dead\
  \ Silence, a SF horror novel in which a woman and her crew board a decades-lost\
  \ luxury cruiser and find the wreckage of a nightmare that hasn't yet ended.</b><br\
  \ /><br /><b>A GHOST SHIP.<br />A SALVAGE CREW.<br />UNSPEAKABLE HORRORS.</b><br\
  \ /><br />Claire Kovalik is days away from being unemployed\u2014made obsolete\u2014\
  when her beacon repair crew picks up a strange distress signal. With nothing to\
  \ lose and no desire to return to Earth, Claire and her team decide to investigate.<br\
  \ /><br />What they find at the other end of the signal is a shock: the Aurora,\
  \ a famous luxury space-liner that vanished on its maiden tour of the solar system\
  \ more than twenty years ago. A salvage claim like this could set Claire and her\
  \ crew up for life. But a quick trip through the Aurora reveals something isn\u2019\
  t right.<br /><br />Whispers in the dark. Flickers of movement. Words scrawled in\
  \ blood. Claire must fight to hold onto her sanity and find out what really happened\
  \ on the Aurora, before she and her crew meet the same ghastly fate."
