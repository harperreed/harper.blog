description: "T<b>he runaway <i>New York Times</i> bestseller that shows American\
  \ parents the secrets behind France's amazingly well-behaved children</b> <br />\
  \ <b> </b> <br /> When American journalist Pamela Druckerman had a baby in Paris,\
  \ she didn't aspire to become a \"French parent.\" But she noticed that French children\
  \ slept through the night by two or three months old. They ate braised leeks. They\
  \ played by themselves while their parents sipped coffee. And yet French kids were\
  \ still boisterous, curious, and creative. Why? How? <br /> <br /> With a notebook\
  \ stashed in her diaper bag, Druckerman set out to investigate\u2014and wound up\
  \ sparking a national debate on parenting. Researched over three years and written\
  \ in her warm, funny voice, <i>Bringing Up B\xE9b\xE9</i> is deeply wise, charmingly\
  \ told, and destined to become a classic resource for American parents. <br /><br\
