description: "The Emperor needs necromancers.<br /><br />The Ninth Necromancer needs\
  \ a swordswoman.<br /><br />Gideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more\
  \ time for undead nonsense.<br /><br />Tamsyn Muir\u2019s Gideon the Ninth unveils\
  \ a solar system of swordplay, cut-throat politics, and lesbian necromancers. Her\
  \ characters leap off the page, as skillfully animated as arcane revenants. The\
  \ result is a heart-pounding epic science fantasy.<br /><br />Brought up by unfriendly,\
  \ ossifying nuns, ancient retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to\
  \ abandon a life of servitude and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs\
  \ up her sword, her shoes, and her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring\
  \ escape. But her childhood nemesis won\u2019t set her free without a service.<br\
  \ /><br />Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone\
  \ witch extraordinaire, has been summoned into action. The Emperor has invited the\
  \ heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark\
  \ succeeds she will be become an immortal, all-powerful servant of the Resurrection,\
  \ but no necromancer can ascend without their cavalier. Without Gideon\u2019s sword,\
  \ Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will die.<br /><br />Of course, some things\
  \ are better left dead.<br /><br />THE LOCKED TOMB TRILOGY<br />BOOK 1: Gideon the\
  \ Ninth<br />BOOK 2: Harrow the Ninth<br />BOOK 3: Alecto the Ninth<br /><br />At\
  \ the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management\
  \ Software (DRM) applied."
