description: Jean le Flambeur is a post-human criminal, mind burglar, confidence artist,
  and trickster. His origins are shrouded in mystery, but his exploits are known throughout
  the Heterarchy- from breaking into the vast Zeusbrains of the Inner System to stealing
  rare Earth antiques from the aristocrats of Mars. Now he's confined inside the Dilemma
  Prison, where every day he has to get up and kill himself before his other self
  can kill him. Rescued by the mysterious Mieli and her flirtatious spacecraft, Jean
  is taken to the Oubliette, the Moving City of Mars, where time is currency, memories
  are treasures, and a moon-turnedsingularity lights the night. What Mieli offers
  is the chance to win back his freedom and the powers of his old self-in exchange
  for finishing the one heist he never quite managed. As Jean undertakes a series
  of capers on behalf of Mieli and her mysterious masters, elsewhere in the Oubliette
  investigator Isidore Beautrelet is called in to investigate the murder of a chocolatier,
  and finds himself on the trail of an arch-criminal, a man named le Flambeur....
  Hannu Rajaniemi's The Quantum Thief is a crazy joyride through the solar system
  several centuries hence, a world of marching cities, ubiquitous public-key encryption,
  people communicating by sharing memories, and a race of hyper-advanced humans who
  originated as MMORPG guild members. But for all its wonders, it is also a story
  powered by very human motives of betrayal, revenge, and jealousy. It is a stunning
  debut.
