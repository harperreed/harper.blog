description: 'It is April 1975, and Saigon is in chaos. At his villa, a general of
  the South Vietnamese army is drinking whiskey and, with the help of his trusted
  captain, drawing up a list of those who will be given passage aboard the last flights
  out of the country. The general and his compatriots start a new life in Los Angeles,
  unaware that one among their number, the captain, is secretly observing and reporting
  on the group to a higher-up in the Viet Cong. <i>The Sympathizer</i> is the story
  of this captain: a man brought up by an absent French father and a poor Vietnamese
  mother, a man who went to university in America, but returned to Vietnam to fight
  for the Communist cause. A gripping spy novel, an astute exploration of extreme
  politics, and a moving love story, <i>The Sympathizer</i> explores a life between
  two worlds and examines the legacy of the Vietnam War in literature, film, and the
  wars we fight today.'
