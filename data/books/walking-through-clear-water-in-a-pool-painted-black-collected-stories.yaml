description: "Legendary as an underground actress, female adventurer, and East Village\
  \ raconteur, Cookie Mueller's first calling was to the written word: \"I started\
  \ writing when I was six and have never stopped completely,\" she once confessed.\
  \ Mueller's 1990 <i>Walking through Clear Water in a Pool Painted Black</i>, the\
  \ first volume of the Semiotext(e) Native Agents series, was the largest collection\
  \ of stories she compiled during her life. But it presented only a slice of Mueller's\
  \ prolific work as a writer. This new, landmark volume collects all of Mueller's\
  \ stories: from the original contents of <i>Clear Water</i>, to additional stories\
  \ discovered by Amy Scholder for the posthumous anthology <i>Ask Dr. Mueller</i>,\
  \ to selections from Mueller's art and advice columns for <i>Details</i> and the\
  \ <i>East Village Eye</i>, to still \"new\" stories collected and published here\
  \ for the first time. Olivia Laing's new introduction situates Mueller's writing\
  \ within the context of her life\u2014and our times.<br /> <br />Thanks to recent\
  \ documentaries like Mallory Curley's <i>A Cookie Mueller Encyclopedia</i> and Chlo\xE9\
  \ Griffin's oral biography <i>Edgewise</i>, Mueller's life and work have been discovered\
  \ by a new generation of readers. <i>Walking through Clear Water in a Pool Painted\
  \ Black: Collected Stories</i> returns essential source material to these readers,\
  \ the archive of Mueller's writing itself. Mueller's many mise en sc\xE8nes\u2014\
  the Baltimore of John Waters, post-Stonewall Provincetown, avant-garde Italy, 1980s\
  \ New York, an America enduring Reagan and AIDS\u2014patches together a singular\
  \ personal history and a primer for others. As Laing writes in her introduction,\
  \ <i>Collected Stories</i> amounts to \"a how-to manual for a life ricocheting joyously\
  \ off the rails . . . a live corrective to conformity, conservatism, and cruelty.\""
