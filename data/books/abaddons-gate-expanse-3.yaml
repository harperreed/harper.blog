description: For generations, the solar system -- Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt
  -- was humanity's great frontier. Until now. The alien artifact working through
  its program under the clouds of Venus has appeared in Uranus's orbit, where it has
  built a massive gate that leads to a starless dark.<br /><br />Jim Holden and the
  crew of the <em>Rocinante</em> are part of a vast flotilla of scientific and military
  ships going out to examine the artifact. But behind the scenes, a complex plot is
  unfolding, with the destruction of Holden at its core. As the emissaries of the
  human race try to find whether the gate is an opportunity or a threat, the greatest
  danger is the one they brought with them.
