description: "The Laconian Empire has fallen, setting the thirteen hundred solar systems\
  \ free from the rule of Winston Duarte. But the ancient enemy that killed the gate\
  \ builders is awake, and the war against our universe has begun again.<br /> <br\
  \ />In the dead system of Adro, Elvi Okoye leads a desperate scientific mission\
  \ to understand what the gate builders were and what destroyed them, even if it\
  \ means compromising herself and the half-alien children who bear the weight of\
  \ her investigation. Through the wide-flung systems of humanity, Colonel Aliana\
  \ Tanaka hunts for Duarte\u2019s missing daughter. . . and the shattered emperor\
  \ himself. And on the Rocinante, James Holden and his crew struggle to build a future\
  \ for humanity out of the shards and ruins of all that has come before.<br /> <br\
  \ />As nearly unimaginable forces prepare to annihilate all human life, Holden and\
  \ a group of unlikely allies discover a last, desperate chance to unite all of humanity,\
  \ with the promise of a vast galactic civilization free from wars, factions, lies,\
  \ and secrets if they win.<br /> <br />But the price of victory may be worse than\
  \ the cost of defeat."
