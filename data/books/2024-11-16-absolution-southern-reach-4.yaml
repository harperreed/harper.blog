description: "<b>Ten years after the publication of <i>Annihilation</i>, the surprise\
  \ fourth volume in Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s blockbuster Southern Reach Trilogy.</b><br\
  \ /><br />When the Southern Reach Trilogy was first published a decade ago, it was\
  \ an instant sensation, celebrated in a front-page <i>New York Times</i> story before\
  \ publication, hailed by Stephen King and many others. Each volume climbed the bestsellers\
  \ list; awards were won; the books made the rare transition from paperback original\
  \ to hardcover; the movie adaptation became a cult classic. All told, the trilogy\
  \ has sold more than a million copies and has secured its place in the pantheon\
  \ of twenty-first-century literature.<br /><br />And yet for all this, for Jeff\
  \ VanderMeer there was never full closure to the story of Area X. There were a few\
  \ mysteries that had gone unsolved, some key points of view never aired. There were\
  \ stories left to tell. There remained questions about who had been complicit in\
  \ creating the conditions for Area X to take hold; the story of the first mission\
  \ into the Forgotten Coast\u2014before Area X was called Area X\u2014had never been\
  \ fully told; and what if someone had foreseen the world after <i>Acceptance</i>?\
  \ How crazy would they seem?<br /><br />Structured in three parts, each recounting\
  \ a new expedition, there are some long-awaited answers here, to be sure, but also\
  \ more questions, and profound new surprises. <i>Absolution</i> is a brilliant,\
  \ beautiful, and ever-terrifying plunge into unique and fertile literary territory.\
  \ It is the final word on one of the most provocative and popular speculative fiction\
  \ series of our time."

      description: "Area X has been cut off from the rest of the world for decades,\
        \ explored only in a series of expeditions dispatched by a secret government\
        \ agency called the Southern Reach. So far these expeditions have returned\
        \ -- when they have returned -- with more questions than answers.\n    \n\
        \    At the beginning of the Southern Reach series, we join the twelfth expedition.\
        \ What unfolds in <i>Annihilation</i>, <i>Authority</i>, and <i>Acceptance</i>\
        \ is an exhilarating, disturbing, and all but unbearably suspenseful story\
        \ of humanity engaged in what might be an existential confrontation with nature.\
        \ The series is destined to become a classic of its kind.\n    \n    <i>Annihilation</i>\
        \ was the basis for the Paramount Pictures film of the same name starring\
        \ Natalie Portman.\n    \n    http://us.macmillan.com/series/TheSouthernReachSeries\n\
        \    \n    Also known as:\n    <i>Trilogia dell'Area X</i>\n    <i>Trilogia\
