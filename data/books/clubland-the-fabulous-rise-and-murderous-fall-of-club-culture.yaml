description: "Outrageous parties. Brazen drug use. Fantastical costumes. Celebrities.\
  \ Wannabes. Gender-bending club kids. Pulse-pounding beats. Sinful orgies. Botched\
  \ police raids. Depraved criminals. Murder. <br /><br />Welcome to the decadent\
  \ nineties club scene.<br />\_<br />In 1995, journalist Frank Owen began researching\
  \ a story on Special K, a designer drug that fueled the after-midnight club scene.\_\
  \ He went to buy and sample the drug at the internationally notorious Limelight,\
  \ a crumbling church converted into a Manhattan disco, where mesmerizing music,\
  \ ecstatic dancers, and uninhibited sideshows attracted long lines of hopeful onlookers.\_\
  \ Owen discovered a world where reckless hedonism was elevated to an art form, and\
  \ where the ever-accelerating party finally spun out of control in the hands of\
  \ notorious club owner Peter Gatien and his minions. In<i> Clubland</i>, Owen reveals\
  \ how a lethal drug ring operated in a lawless, black-lit realm of fantasy, and\
  \ how, when the lights came up, their excesses left countless victims in their wake.\_\
  \ <br /><br />Praised for his risk-taking and exhilarating writing style, Frank\
  \ Owen has spawned a hybrid of literary nonfiction and true crime, capturing the\
  \ zeitgeist of a world that emerged in the spirit of \u201Cpeace, love, unity and\
  \ respect,\u201D and ended in tragedy.\_"
