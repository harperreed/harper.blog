description: On a remote, icy planet, the soldier known as Breq is drawing closer
  to completing her quest. Once, she was the <i>Justice of Toren</i> - a colossal
  starship with an artificial intelligence linking thousands of soldiers in the service
  of the Radch, the empire that conquered the galaxy. Now, an act of treachery has
  ripped it all away, leaving her with one fragile human body, unanswered questions,
  and a burning desire for vengeance.
