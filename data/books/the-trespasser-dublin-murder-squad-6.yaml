description: "<b>A brilliant new novel from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling\
  \ author, whom Gillian Flynn calls \"mesmerizing\" and Stephen King calls \"incandescent.\"\
  </b><br /><br /><br />Being on the Murder squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette\
  \ Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who\
  \ seems glad she\u2019s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless\
  \ cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she\u2019\
  s getting close to the breaking point.<br /><br />Their new case looks like yet\
  \ another by-the-numbers lovers\u2019 quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond,\
  \ pretty, groomed to a shine, and dead in her catalogue-perfect living room, next\
  \ to a table set for a romantic dinner. There\u2019s nothing unusual about her\u2014\
  except that Antoinette\u2019s seen her somewhere before.<br /><br />And that her\
  \ death won\u2019t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying\
  \ to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn\u2019s boyfriend, fast. There\u2019\
  s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinette's road. Aislinn's friend is hinting\
  \ that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn\
  \ takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.<br /><br />Antoinette\
  \ knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can\u2019t tell just how\
  \ far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the\
  \ squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?"
