description: "<b>From the Hugo Award\xAD\xAD\u2013winning author of <i>The Stars Are\
  \ Legion </i>comes a brand-new science fiction thriller about a futuristic war during\
  \ which soldiers are broken down into light in order to get them to the front lines\
  \ on Mars.</b><br /><br /><i>They said the war would turn us into light. </i><br\
  \ /><i>I wanted to be counted among the heroes who gave us this better world. </i><br\
  \ /><br />The Light Brigade: it\u2019s what soldiers fighting the war against Mars\
  \ call the ones who come back\u2026different. Grunts in the corporate corps get\
  \ busted down into light to travel to and from interplanetary battlefronts. Everyone\
  \ is changed by what the corps must do in order to break them down into light. Those\
  \ who survive learn to stick to the mission brief\u2014no matter what actually happens\
  \ during combat.<br /><br />Dietz, a fresh recruit in the infantry, begins to experience\
  \ combat drops that don\u2019t sync up with the platoon\u2019s. And Dietz\u2019\
  s bad drops tell a story of the war that\u2019s not at all what the corporate brass\
  \ want the soldiers to think is going on.<br /><br />Is Dietz really experiencing\
  \ the war differently, or is it combat madness? Trying to untangle memory from mission\
  \ brief and survive with sanity intact, Dietz is ready to become a hero\u2014or\
  \ maybe a villain; in war it\u2019s hard to tell the difference.<br /><br />A worthy\
  \ successor to classic stories like <i>Downbelow Station</i>, <i>Starship Troopers</i>,\
  \ and<i> The Forever War</i>,<i> The Light Brigade</i> is award-winning author Kameron\
  \ Hurley\u2019s gritty time-bending take on the future of war."
