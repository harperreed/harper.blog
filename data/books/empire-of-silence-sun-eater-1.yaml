description: "<b>Hadrian Marlowe, a man revered as a hero and despised as a murderer,\
  \ chronicles his tale in the galaxy-spanning debut of the Sun Eater series, merging\
  \ the best of space opera and epic fantasy.</b><br /><br />It was not his war.<br\
  \ /><br />On the wrong planet, at the right time, for the best reasons, Hadrian\
  \ Marlowe started down a path that could only end in fire. The galaxy remembers\
  \ him as a hero: the man who burned every last alien Cielcin from the sky. They\
  \ remember him as a monster: the devil who destroyed a sun, casually annihilating\
  \ four billion human lives\u2014even the Emperor himself\u2014against Imperial orders.<br\
  \ /><br />But Hadrian was not a hero. He was not a monster. He was not even a soldier.<br\
  \ /><br />Fleeing his father and a future as a torturer, Hadrian finds himself stranded\
  \ on a strange, backwater world. Forced to fight as a gladiator and navigate the\
  \ intrigues of a foreign planetary court, he will find himself fighting a war he\
  \ did not start, for an Empire he does not love, against an enemy he will never\
  \ understand."
