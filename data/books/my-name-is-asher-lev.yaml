description: "Asher Lev is a Ladover Hasid who keeps kosher, prays three times a day\
  \ and believes in the Ribbono Shel Olom, the Master of the Universe. Asher Lev is\
  \ an artist who is compulsively driven to render the world he sees and feels even\
  \ when it leads him to blasphemy.In this stirring and often visionary novel, Chaim\
  \ Potok traces Asher\u2019s passage between these two identities, the one consecrated\
  \ to God, the other subject only to the imagination.<br /><br />Asher Lev grows\
  \ up in a cloistered Hasidic community in postwar Brooklyn, a world suffused by\
  \ ritual and revolving around a charismatic Rebbe. But in time his gift threatens\
  \ to estrange him from that world and the parents he adores. As it follows his struggle,\
  \ <b>My Name Is Asher Lev</b> becomes a luminous portrait of the artist, by turns\
  \ heartbreaking and exultant, a modern classic."
