description: 'The ex-planet Pluto has a few choice words about being thrown out of
  the solar system. A listing of alternate histories tells you all the various ways
  Hitler has died. A lawyer sues an interplanetary union for dangerous working conditions.
  And four artificial intelligences explain, in increasingly worrying detail, how
  they plan not to destroy humanity. Welcome to <i>Miniatures: The Very Short Fiction
  of John Scalzi</i>.<br /><br />These four stories, along with 14 other pieces, have
  one thing in common: They''re short, sharp, and to the point - science fiction in
  miniature, with none of the stories longer than 2,300 words. But in that short space
  exist entire universes, absurd situations, and the sort of futuristic humor that
  propelled Scalzi to a Hugo with his novel <i>Redshirts</i>. Not to mention yogurt
  taking over the world (as it would).<br /><br />Spanning the years from 1991 to
  2016, this collection is a quarter century of Scalzi at his briefest and best and
  features four never-before-published stories exclusive to this collection: "Morning
  Announcements at the Lucas Interspecies School for Troubled Youth", "Your Smart
  Appliances Talk About You Behind Your Back", "Important Holidays on Gronghu", and
  "The AI Are Absolutely Positively Without a Doubt Not Here to End Humanity, Honest".<br
  /><br />John Scalzi is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Old Man''s
  War</i>, <i>Lock In</i>, and <i>Redshirts</i>, among others. His work has won the
  Hugo and Locus Awards and been nominated for the Nebula and Campbell Awards. He
  lives in Ohio and online. He enjoys pie.<br /><br />Full cast of narrators includes
  Oliver Wyman, Dina Pearlman, and Allyson Johnson.'
