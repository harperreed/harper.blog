description: "'The financial investigation of the decade... Money Men instantly enters\
  \ the canon of great financial crime books' Bradley Hope, author of The Billion\
  \ Dollar Whale<br /><br />'A rip-roaring ride into the underworld of the global\
  \ economy' Tom Burgis, author of Kleptopia<br /><br />This is the stranger-than-fiction\
  \ story of Wirecard, once a $30 billion tech darling, now a smouldering wreck, by\
  \ the journalist who brought it crashing down - perfect for those who loved Bad\
  \ Blood and Empire of Pain.<br /><br />When journalist Dan McCrum followed a tip\
  \ to investigate the hot new tech company challenging Silicon Valley, everything\
  \ about Wirecard looked a little too good to be true: offices were sprouting up\
  \ around the world, it was reporting runaway growth and the CEO even wore a black\
  \ turtleneck in tribute to Steve Jobs. In the space of a few short years, the company\
  \ had come from nowhere to overtake industry giants like Commerzbank and Deutsche\
  \ Bank on the stock market.<br /><br />As McCrum dug deeper, he encountered a story\
  \ stranger and more dangerous than he ever imagined: a world of short sellers and\
  \ whistleblowers, pornographers and private militias, hackers and spies. Before\
  \ long he realised that he wasn't the only one in pursuit. Shadowy figures were\
  \ following him through the streets of London, high-flying lawyers were sending\
  \ ominous letters to his boss, and he was named as the prime suspect in a criminal\
  \ inquiry. The race was on to prove his suspicions and clear his name.<br /><br\
  \ />Money Men is the astonishing inside story of Wirecard's multi-billion-dollar\
  \ fraud, Europe's biggest new tech darling revealed as a house of cards. Uncovering\
  \ fake bank accounts, fake offices and possibly even a fake death, McCrum offers\
  \ a searing expos\xE9 that will finally lay bare the truth."
