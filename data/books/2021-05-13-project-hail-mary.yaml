description: A lone astronaut.<br />An impossible mission.<br />An ally he never imagined.<br
  /><br />Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission -
  and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.<br /><br />Except that
  right now, he doesn't know that. He can't even remember his own name, let alone
  the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.<br /><br />All he knows is that
  he's been asleep for a very, very long time. And he's just been awakened to find
  himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.<br
  /><br />His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that
  an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship,
  it's up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery-and conquer an extinction-level
  threat to our species.<br /><br />And with the clock ticking down and the nearest
  human being light-years away, he's got to do it all alone.<br /><br />Or does he?
