description: "Written in elegiac prose, Lepore\u2019s groundbreaking investigation\
  \ places truth itself\u2014a devotion to facts, proof, and evidence\u2014at the\
  \ center of the nation\u2019s history. The American experiment rests on three ideas\u2014\
  \"these truths,\" Jefferson called them\u2014political equality, natural rights,\
  \ and the sovereignty of the people. And it rests, too, on a fearless dedication\
  \ to inquiry, Lepore argues, because self-government depends on it. But has the\
  \ nation, and democracy itself, delivered on that promise?<br /><br /><em>These\
  \ Truths</em> tells this uniquely American story, beginning in 1492, asking whether\
  \ the course of events over more than five centuries has proven the nation\u2019\
  s truths, or belied them. To answer that question, Lepore traces the intertwined\
  \ histories of American politics, law, journalism, and technology, from the colonial\
  \ town meeting to the nineteenth-century party machine, from talk radio to twenty-first-century\
  \ Internet polls, from Magna Carta to the Patriot Act, from the printing press to\
  \ Facebook News.<br /><br />Along the way, Lepore\u2019s sovereign chronicle is\
  \ filled with arresting sketches of both well-known and lesser-known Americans,\
  \ from a parade of presidents and a rogues\u2019 gallery of political mischief makers\
  \ to the intrepid leaders of protest movements, including Frederick Douglass, the\
  \ famed abolitionist orator; William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential\
  \ candidate and ultimately tragic populist; Pauli Murray, the visionary civil rights\
  \ strategist; and Phyllis Schlafly, the uncredited architect of modern conservatism.<br\
  \ /><br /><br />Americans are descended from slaves and slave owners, from conquerors\
  \ and the conquered, from immigrants and from people who have fought to end immigration.\
  \ \"A nation born in contradiction will fight forever over the meaning of its history,\"\
  \ Lepore writes, but engaging in that struggle by studying the past is part of the\
  \ work of citizenship. \"The past is an inheritance, a gift and a burden,\" <em>These\
  \ Truths</em> observes. \"It can\u2019t be shirked. There\u2019s nothing for it\
  \ but to get to know it.\""
