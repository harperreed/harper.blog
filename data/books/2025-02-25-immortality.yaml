description: "Immortality has received a starred review from Publisher\u2019s Weekly\
  \ as well as high praise from many other book review publications. Immortality was\
  \ a #1 best-selling techno-thriller on Amazon from January 2008 to June 2014. <br\
  \ /><br />Publisher's Weekly starred review: When human extinctions occur in South\
  \ America and spread worldwide, paleobiologist and genetic researcher Mark Freedman\
  \ senses a connection to the Chromatium Omri bacteria, the oldest known life form\
  \ on Earth linked to previous extinctions. The growing virulence in the \"kill zones\"\
  \ spurs Freedman to join forces with Kathy Morrison, expert on viral and bacterial\
  \ pathogens with the Centers for Disease Control. Despite personal losses, Freedman\
  \ and Morrison find romance and make discoveries about the devastation and what\
  \ lies behind it. Other colorful characters include dedicated policewoman Sarah\
  \ Mayfair, whose horrific dreams and improbable survival enable contact with the\
  \ forces behind the outbreaks; cynical Gen. James McKafferty, committed to preserving\
  \ the U.S. at whatever cost; and Artie Hartman, goaded by his wife's death to wage\
  \ war on gangs and government forces indiscriminately. The seemingly random attacks\
  \ and emergence of chaos allow Bohacz to explore such themes as whether humanity\
  \ deserves to survive, the meaning of being human, and the cost of perfect health\
  \ and immortality. The originality of Bohacz's ideas is nearly equaled by detailed\
  \ descriptions of a decontamination lab, the frenzied search for answers, and the\
  \ aftermath of destruction. His vision of a humanity that faces the need to evolve\
  \ profoundly or face certain destruction is as timely as today's news and as chilling\
  \ a doomsday scenario as any ecological catastrophe can suggest.<br /><br />Kirkus\_\
  - There is enough power in the premise to leave readers reeling. A novel that will\
  \ surprise fans of science-fiction and doomsday scenarios.<br /><br />\"Speaking\
  \ as an evolved Transhuman, I applaud this very entertaining, intelligent, and thought\
  \ provoking journey to the edges of humanity.\" -\_Danny Rubin, author and screenwriter\
  \ of Groundhog Day.<br /><br />\"Immortality is a fine, tense, scientific mystery\
  \ adventure that puts mankind in a challenge of survival with a short time limit.\
  \ This is the way the world could end.\" -\_Piers Anthony, author of 21 New York\
  \ Times best-selling novels.<br /><br />Sci-Fi Reader - 4Stars\_- \"This book manages\
  \ to do what all the best sci-fi does - provide a thought-provoking, alternative\
  \ viewpoint on the business of existence. I recommend you give it a go.\" - sfreader.com.<br\
  \ /><br />The story begun in\_Immortality\_is not over and continues in the sequel\_\
  Ghost of the Gods."
