description: Late in the twenty-sixth century, the human race has advanced enough
  to accidentally trigger the Inhibitors - alien killing machines designed to detect
  intelligent life and destroy it. The only hope for humanity lies in the recovery
  of a secret cache of doomsday weapons -and a renegade named Clavain who is determined
  to find them. But other factions want the weapons for their own purposes - and the
  weapons themselves have another agenda altogether...

      description: "\n\n    The Revelation Space universe is a fictional universe\
        \ which was created by Alastair Reynolds and used as the setting for a number\
        \ of his novels and stories. Its fictional history follows the human species\
        \ through various conflicts from the relatively near future (roughly 2200)\
        \ to approximately AD 40000 (all the novels to date are set between 2427 and\
        \ 2727, although certain stories extend beyond this period). It takes its\
        \ name from Revelation Space, which was the first published novel set in the\
        \ universe.\r\n    \r\n    The main trilogy (also known as the Inhibitor trilogy)\
        \ consists of 1) Revelation Space, 2) Redemption Ark and 3) Absolution Gap,\
        \ and deals with humanity coming to the attention of the inhibitors and the\
        \ resultant war between them.\r\n    \r\n    Reynolds says of the reading\
        \ order: \"Of my books to date, five are set in the same universe. The reading\
        \ order isn\u2019t that critical, in my view, but it probably improves things\
        \ to read REVELATION SPACE, REDEMPTION ARK and ABSOLUTION GAP in that sequence.\
        \ The other related books, CHASM CITY and THE PREFECT, as well as the collections\
        \ DIAMOND DOGS, TURQUOISE DAYS and GALACTIC NORTH, can be read at any point\
        \ (or in fact, not read at all).\"\r\n    \r\n    This is the approximate\
        \ chronological order for the short stories, novels and novellas:\r\n    \r\
        \n    Great Wall of Mars* - <i>(2205, published February 2000)</i>\r\n   \
        \ Glacial* - <i>(2217, published March 2001)</i>\r\n    A Spy in Europa* -\
        \ <i>(ca. 2330 - 2340, published 1997)</i>\r\n    Weather* - <i>(2358, published\
        \ 2006)</i>\r\n    The Prefect (Novel, Standalone) - <i>(2427, published 2007)</i>\r\
        \n    The Last Log of the Lachrimosa**** - <i>(ca. 2500 - 2550, published\
        \ 2014)</i>\r\n    Diamond Dogs** - <i>(ca. 2500 - 2550, published 2001)</i>\r\
        \n    Monkey Suit*** - <i>(ca. 2511, published 2009)</i>\r\n    Dilation Sleep*\
        \ - <i>(ca. 2513 - 2540, published 1990)</i>\r\n    Chasm City (Novel, Standalone)\
        \ - <i>(ca. 2517 - 2524, published 2001)</i>\r\n    Grafenwalder's Bestiary*\
        \ - <i>(ca. 2540, published 2006)</i>\r\n    Turquoise Days** - <i>(2541,\
        \ published 2002)</i>\r\n    Revelation Space (Novel, #1 of The Inhibitor\
        \ Trilogy) - <i>(2524 - 2567, published 2000)</i>\r\n    Nightingale* - <i>(ca.\
        \ 2600, published 2006)</i>\r\n    Redemption Ark (Novel, #2 of The Inhibitor\
        \ Trilogy) - <i>(2605 - 2651, published 2002)</i>\r\n    Absolution Gap (Novel,\
        \ #3 of The Inhibitor Trilogy) - <i>(ca. 2615 - 3125, published 2003)</i>\r\
        \n    Galactic North* - <i>(ca. 2303 - 40000, published 1999)</i>\r\n    \r\
        \n    *Story or Novella in Galactic North\r\n    **Novella in Diamond Dogs,\
        \ Turquoise Days\r\n    ***Story originally published in Death Ray #20 (July\
        \ 2009); reprinted in Deep Navigation\r\n    ****Story originally published\
        \ in Subterranean (Summer 2014); also on their website\r\n    \r\n    The\
        \ reading order for Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space universe stories is\
        \ complex, with the novels overlapping with the short stories (collected in\
        \ Galactic North) and the two novellas (collected in Diamond Dogs, Turquoise\
        \ Days). Whether the chronological order is the best reading order for the\
        \ books or not is debatable. It mostly works, although  'Weather' contains\
        \ the answer to a major mystery from the main trilogy about the Conjoiner\
        \ lighthugger drives and may benefit from being read later on. \r\n    \r\n\
        \    'Great Wall of Mars' and 'Glacial' introduce characters who otherwise\
        \ show up out of nowhere in Redemption Ark, and 'Galactic North' (the story)\
        \  explains the ending to Absolution Gap and puts something of a full stop\
        \ on the whole series and story.\n\n"
