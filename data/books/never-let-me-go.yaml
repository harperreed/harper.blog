description: "From the Booker Prize-winning author of <i>The Remains of the Day</i>\
  \ and <i>When We Were Orphans</i>, comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery\
  \ that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means\
  \ to be human.<br /><br />Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school,\
  \ far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported,\
  \ trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants\
  \ them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are\
  \ allowed little contact with it.<br /><br />Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy\
  \ grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it\u2019s only when she and her friends\
  \ Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they\
  \ would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.<br /><br /><i>Never\
  \ Let Me Go</i> breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping\
  \ mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance\
  \ and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society.\
  \ In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on\
  \ the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date."
