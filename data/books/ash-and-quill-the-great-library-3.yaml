description: "Hoarding all the knowledge of the world, the Great Library jealousy\
  \ guards its secrets. But now a group of rebels poses a dangerous threat to its\
  \ tyranny....<br /><br />Jess Brightwell and his band of exiles have fled London,\
  \ only to find themselves imprisoned in Philadelphia, a city led by those who would\
  \ rather burn books than submit. But Jess and his friends have a bargaining chip:\
  \ the knowledge to build a machine that will break the Library\u2019s rule.<br /><br\
  \ />Their time is running out. To survive, they\u2019ll have to choose to live or\
  \ die as one, to take the fight to their enemies\u2014and to save the very soul\
  \ of the Great Library...."
