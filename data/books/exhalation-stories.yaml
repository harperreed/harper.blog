description: "<i>An alternate cover edition for this book can be found <a href=\"\
  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46347126-exhalation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\
  >here.</a></i><br /><br />In these nine stunningly original, provocative, and poignant\
  \ stories, Ted Chiang tackles some of humanity\u2019s oldest questions along with\
  \ new quandaries only he could imagine.<br /><br />In \"The Merchant and the Alchemist's\
  \ Gate,\" a portal through time forces a fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple\
  \ with past mistakes and second chances. In \"Exhalation,\" an alien scientist makes\
  \ a shocking discovery with ramifications that are literally universal. In \"Anxiety\
  \ Is the Dizziness of Freedom,\" the ability to glimpse into alternate universes\
  \ necessitates a radically new examination of the concepts of choice and free will.<br\
  \ /><br />Including stories being published for the first time as well as some of\
  \ his rare and classic uncollected work, <i>Exhalation</i> is Ted Chiang at his\
  \ best: profound, sympathetic\u2014revelatory."
