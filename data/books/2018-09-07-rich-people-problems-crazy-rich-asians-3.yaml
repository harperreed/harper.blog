description: "<b>Kevin Kwan, bestselling author of <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> and <i>China\
  \ Rich Girlfriend</i>, is back with an uproarious new novel of a family riven by\
  \ fortune, an ex-wife driven psychotic with jealousy, a battle royal fought through\
  \ couture gown sabotage, and the heir to one of Asia's greatest fortunes locked\
  \ out of his inheritance. </b><br /><br />When Nicholas Young hears that his grandmother,\
  \ Su Yi, is on her deathbed, he rushes to be by her bedside\u2014but he's not alone.\
  \ It seems the entire Shang-Young clan has convened from all corners of the globe,\
  \ ostensibly to care for their matriarch but truly to stake claim on the massive\
  \ fortune that Su Yi controls. With each family member secretly fantasizing about\
  \ getting the keys to Tyersall Park\u2014a trophy estate on 64 prime acres in the\
  \ heart of Singapore\u2014the place becomes a hotbed of intrigue and Nicholas finds\
  \ himself blocked from entering the premises. As relatives claw over heirlooms,\
  \ Astrid Leong is at the center of her own storm, desperately in love with her old\
  \ sweetheart Charlie Wu, but tormented by his ex-wife\u2014a woman hell bent on\
  \ destroying Astrid's reputation and relationship. Meanwhile Kitty Pong, married\
  \ to billionaire Jack Bing, finds a formidable opponent in his fashionista daughter,\
  \ Colette. A sweeping novel that takes us from the elegantly appointed mansions\
  \ of Manila to the secluded private islands in the Sulu Sea, from a schoolyard kidnapping\
  \ to a gold-leaf dancefloor spattered with blood, Kevin Kwan's gloriously wicked\
  \ new novel reveals the long-buried secrets and rich people problems of Asia's most\
  \ privileged families."

      description: When Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her
        boyfriend, Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives
        to explore the island, and quality time with the man she might one day marry.
        What she doesn't know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace,
        that she'll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's
        most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on
        her back.
