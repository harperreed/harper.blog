description: "<b>From Tana French\u2014author of <i>The Witch Elm</i> and \u201Cthe\
  \ most important crime novelist to emerge in the past 10 years\u201D (<i>The Washington\
  \ Post</i>)\u2014the bestseller called \u201Cthe most stunning of her books\u201D\
  \ (<i>The New York Times</i>) and a finalist for the Edgar Award.</b> <br /><br\
  \ />Back in 1985, Frank Mackey was a nineteen-year-old kid with a dream of escaping\
  \ his family\u02BCs cramped flat on Faithful Place and running away to London with\
  \ his girl, Rosie Daly. But on the night they were supposed to leave, Rosie didn\u02BC\
  t show. Frank took it for granted that she\u02BCd dumped him\u2014probably because\
  \ of his alcoholic father, nutcase mother, and generally dysfunctional family. He\
  \ never went home again. Neither did Rosie. Then, twenty-two years later, Rosie\u02BC\
  s suitcase shows up behind a fireplace in a derelict house on Faithful Place, and\
  \ Frank, now a detective in the Dublin Undercover Squad, is going home whether he\
  \ likes it or not."
