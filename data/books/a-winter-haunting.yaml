description: A once-respected college professor and novelist, Dale Stewart has sabotaged
  his career and his marriage -- and now darkness is closing in on him. In the last
  hours of Halloween he has returned to the dying town of Elm Haven, his boyhood home,
  where he hopes to find peace in isolation. But moving into a long-deserted farmhouse
  on the far outskirts of town -- the one-time residence of a strange and brilliant
  friend who lost his young life in a grisly "accident" back in the terrible summer
  of 1960 -- is only the latest in his long succession of recent mistakes. Because
  Dale is not alone here. He has been followed to this house of shadows by private
  demons who are now twisting his reality into horrifying new forms. And a thick,
  blanketing early snow is starting to fall ...
