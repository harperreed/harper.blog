description: 'The near-distant future. Millions of kilometres from Earth.<br /><br
  />The crew of the Six-Thousand Ship consists of those who were born, and those who
  were made. Those who will die, and those who will not. When the ship takes on a
  number of strange objects from the planet New Discovery, the crew is perplexed to
  find itself becoming deeply attached to them, and human and humanoid employees alike
  start aching for the same things: warmth and intimacy. Loved ones who have passed.
  Shopping and child-rearing. Our shared, far-away Earth, which now only persists
  in memory.<br /><br />Gradually, the crew members come to see their work in a new
  light, and each employee is compelled to ask themselves whether they can carry on
  as before and what it means to be truly living.<br /><br />Structured as a series
  of witness statements compiled by a workplace commission, Ravn''s crackling prose
  is as chilling as it is moving, as exhilarating as it is foreboding. Wracked by
  all kinds of longing, The Employees probes into what it means to be human, emotionally
  and ontologically, while simultaneously delivering an overdue critique of a life
  governed by work and the logic of productivity.'
