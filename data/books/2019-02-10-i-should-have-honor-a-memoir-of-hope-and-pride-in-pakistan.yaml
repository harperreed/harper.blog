description: "<b>A fearless memoir about tribal life in Pakistan\u2014and the act\
  \ of violence that inspired one ambitious young woman to pursue a life of activism\
  \ and female empowerment.<br /><br />\"Khalida Brohi understands the true nature\
  \ of honor. She is fearless in her pursuit of justice and equality.\"\u2014Malala\
  \ Yousafzai, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize</b><br /><br />From a young age, Khalida\
  \ Brohi was raised to believe in the sanctity of arranged marriage. Her mother was\
  \ forced to marry a thirteen-year-old boy when she was only nine; Khalida herself\
  \ was promised as a bride before she was even born. But her father refused to let\
  \ her become a child bride. He was a man who believed in education, not just for\
  \ himself but for his daughters, and Khalida grew up thinking she would become the\
  \ first female doctor in her small village. Khalida thought her life was proceeding\
  \ on an unusual track for a woman of her circumstances, but one whose path was orderly\
  \ and straightforward.<br /><br />Everything shifted for Khalida when she found\
  \ out that her beloved cousin had been murdered by her uncle in a tradition known\
  \ as \"honor killing.\" Her cousin's crime? She had fallen in love with a man who\
  \ was not her betrothed. This moment ignited the spark in Khalida Brohi that inspired\
  \ a globe-spanning career as an activist, beginning at the age of sixteen. From\
  \ a tiny cement-roofed room in Karachi where she was allowed ten minutes of computer\
  \ use per day, Brohi started a Facebook campaign that went viral. From there, she\
  \ created a foundation focused on empowering the lives of women in rural communities\
  \ through education and employment opportunities, while crucially working to change\
  \ the minds of their male partners, fathers, and brothers.<br /><br />This book\
  \ is the story of how Brohi, while only a girl herself, shone her light on the women\
  \ and girls of Pakistan, despite the hurdles and threats she faced along the way.\
  \ And ultimately, she learned that the only way to eradicate the parts of a culture\
  \ she despised was to fully embrace the parts of it that she loved.<br /><br /><b>Advance\
  \ praise for <i>I Should Have Honor</i></b><br /><br />\"Khalida Brohi's moving\
  \ story is a testament to what is possible no matter the odds. In her courageous\
  \ activism and now in I Should Have Honor, Khalida gives a voice to the women and\
  \ girls who are denied their own by society. This book is a true act of honor.\"\
