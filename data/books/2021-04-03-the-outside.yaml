description: "<i>The Pride of Jai</i> was supposed to be humanity's greatest accomplishment\u2014\
  a space station made entirely by humans and their primitive computers, without \"\
  divine\" cyber-technology provided by the sentient quantum supercomputers worshipped\
  \ as Gods. And it was supposed to be a personal triumph for its young lead scientist,\
  \ physicist Yasira Shien, whose innovative mathematics was key to the reactor powering\
  \ it.<br /><br />But something goes wrong in Yasira's reactor, leading to an unexplained\
  \ singularity that destroys <i>The Pride of Jai</i> and most of the people on it\u2014\
  and placing Yasira in the sights of angry Angels, the cyborg servants of the Gods.<br\
  \ /><br />According to the angels, Yasira's reactor malfunction was the latest in\
  \ a rising tide of disasters, intentionally caused to exploit vulnerabilities in\
  \ the very pattern of spacetime and usher in horrific beings from beyond reality\
  \ itself. They believe that the woman behind the disasters is Yasira's long-vanished\
  \ mentor, Dr Evianna Talirr\u2014and they believe that Yasira, Dr Talirr's favorite\
  \ student, is the only one who can help them find her.<br /><br />Spirited off to\
  \ the edge of the galaxy and with her whole planet's fate, and more, hanging in\
  \ the balance, Yasira must decide who to trust: the ruthless angels she was always\
  \ taught to obey without question\u2014or the heretic scientist whose plans could\
  \ change everything she knows to be true about reality."
