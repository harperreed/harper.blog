description: "Only rarely does a novelist weave a tapestry so compelling that it captures\
  \ the imagination of the entire world. But that is precisely what Arthur C. Clarke\
  \ accomplished with <i>2001: a space odyssey.</i><br /><br />It is even more unusual\
  \ that an author is able to complement so well-received an invention with an equally\
  \ successful sequel. But Arthur C. Clarke`s <i>2010: odyssey two</i> enthralled\
  \ a huge audience worldwide.<br /><br />Now, in <i>2061: odyssey three</i>, Arthur\
  \ C. Clarke revisits the most famous future ever imagined, as two expeditions into\
  \ space are inextricably tangled by human necessity and the immutable laws of physics.\
  \ And Heywood Floyd, survivor of two previous encounters with the mysterious monoliths,\
  \ must once again confront Dave Bowman\u2014or whatever Bowman has become\u2014\
  a newly independent HAL, and the power of an alien race that has decided Mankind\
  \ is to play a part in the evolution of the galaxy whether it wishes to or not."
