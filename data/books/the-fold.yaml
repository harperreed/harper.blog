description: "<i>STEP INTO THE FOLD.</i><br /><i> IT\u2019S PERFECTLY SAFE. <br /></i><br\
  \ /> The folks in Mike Erikson's small New England town would say he's just your\
  \ average, everyday guy. And that's exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he's\
  \ chosen isn\u2019t much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he\u2019\
  s content with his quiet and peaceful existence. \_<br /><br /> That is, until an\
  \ old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely\
  \ qualified to solve: far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists\
  \ has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic\
  \ computer equation and magnetic fields to \u201Cfold\u201D dimensions, it shrinks\
  \ distances so that a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. <br\
  \ /><br />The invention promises to make mankind\u2019s dreams of teleportation\
  \ a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the Door is completely\
  \ safe. <br /><br /> Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn\u2019\
  t quite what it seems\u2014and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret.\
  \ \_<br /><br />As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins\
  \ to fear there\u2019s only one answer that makes sense. And if he\u2019s right,\
  \ it may only be a matter of time before the project destroys\u2026everything. \_\
  <br /><br />A cunningly inventive mystery featuring a hero worthy of Sherlock Holmes\
  \ and a terrifying final twist you\u2019ll never see coming,<i> The Fold</i> is\
  \ that rarest of things: a genuinely page-turning science-fiction thriller. Step\
  \ inside its pages and learn why author Peter Clines has already won legions of\
  \ loyal fans."
