description: "In the wake of nuclear terrorism, a squad of elite soldiers must combat\
  \ artificial intelligence and seek justice in this military political thriller,\
  \ a sequel to <i>The Red</i>.<br /><br />Lieutenant James Shelley and his squad\
  \ of US Army soldiers were on a quest for justice when they carried out the unauthorized\
  \ mission known as First Light. They returned home to America to face a court-martial,\
  \ determined to expose the corruption in the chain of command that compelled their\
  \ actions. But in a country still reeling from the nuclear terrorism of Coma Day,\
  \ the courtroom is just one battlefield of many.<br /><br />A new cycle of violence\
  \ ignites when rumors of the elusive, rogue AI known as the Red go public\u2014\
  and Shelley is, once again, pulled into the fray. Challenged by his enemies, driven\
  \ by ideals, Shelley feels compelled to act. But are the harrowing choices he makes\
  \ really his own, or are they made for him, by the Red? And with millions of lives\
  \ at stake in a game of nuclear cat-and-mouse, does the answer even matter?"
