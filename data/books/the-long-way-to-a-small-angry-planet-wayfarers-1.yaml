description: "<strong>Follow a motley crew on an exciting journey through space\u2014\
  and one adventurous young explorer who discovers the meaning of family in the far\
  \ reaches of the universe\u2014in this light-hearted debut space opera from a rising\
  \ sci-fi star.</strong><p>Rosemary Harper doesn\u2019t expect much when she joins\
  \ the crew of the aging <em>Wayfarer</em>. While the patched-up ship has seen better\
  \ days, it offers her a bed, a chance to explore the far-off corners of the galaxy,\
  \ and most importantly, some distance from her past. An introspective young woman\
  \ who learned early to keep to herself, she\u2019s never met anyone remotely like\
  \ the ship\u2019s diverse crew, including Sissix, the exotic reptilian pilot, chatty\
  \ engineers Kizzy and Jenks who keep the ship running, and Ashby, their noble captain.</p><p>Life\
  \ aboard the <em>Wayfarer</em> is chaotic and crazy\u2014exactly what Rosemary wants.\
  \ It\u2019s also about to get extremely dangerous when the crew is offered the job\
  \ of a lifetime. Tunneling wormholes through space to a distant planet is definitely\
  \ lucrative and will keep them comfortable for years. But risking her life wasn\u2019\
  t part of the plan. In the far reaches of deep space, the tiny <em>Wayfarer</em>\
  \ crew will confront a host of unexpected mishaps and thrilling adventures that\
  \ force them to depend on each other. To survive, Rosemary\u2019s got to learn how\
  \ to rely on this assortment of oddballs\u2014an experience that teaches her about\
  \ love and trust, and that having a family isn\u2019t necessarily the worst thing\
  \ in the universe.</p>"
