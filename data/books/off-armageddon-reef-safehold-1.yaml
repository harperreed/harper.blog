description: 'Humanity pushed its way to the stars - and encountered the Gbaba, a
  ruthless alien race that nearly wiped us out.<br /><br />Earth and her colonies
  are now smoldering ruins, and the few survivors have fled to distant, Earth-like
  Safehold, to try to rebuild. But the Gbaba can detect the emissions of an industrial
  civilization, so the human rulers of Safehold have taken extraordinary measures:
  with mind control and hidden high technology, they''ve built a religion in which
  every Safeholdian believes, a religion designed to keep Safehold society medieval
  forever.<br /><br />800 years pass. In a hidden chamber on Safehold, an android
  from the far human past awakens. This "rebirth" was set in motion centuries before,
  by a faction that opposed shackling humanity with a concocted religion. Via automated
  recordings, "Nimue" - or, rather, the android with the memories of Lieutenant Commander
  Nimue Alban - is told her fate: she will emerge into Safeholdian society, suitably
  disguised, and begin the process of provoking the technological progress which the
  Church of God Awaiting has worked for centuries to prevent.<br /><br />Nothing about
  this will be easy. To better deal with a medieval society, "Nimue" takes a new gender
  and a new name, "Merlin." His formidable powers and access to caches of hidden high
  technology will need to be carefully concealed. And he''ll need to find a base of
  operations, a Safeholdian country that''s just a little more freewheeling, a little
  less orthodox, a little more open to the new.<br /><br />And thus Merlin comes to
  Charis, a mid-sized kingdom with a talent for naval warfare. He plans to make the
  acquaintance of King Haarahld and Crown Prince Cayleb, and maybe, just maybe, kick
  off a new era of invention. Which is bound to draw the attention of the Church...and,
  inevitably, lead to war.'

      description: "\n\n    German: Nimue Alban\r\n    \r\n    The series is mostly\
        \ set around the 31st century, on a distant world dubbed \"Safehold\" where\
        \ a group of humans has hidden themselves from an alien race known as the\
        \ Gbaba. When first contact was made between the humans and the Gbaba, the\
        \ Gbaba began an extermination campaign which nearly succeeded in destroying\
        \ all known humans in the galaxy, including the entire population of Earth.\
        \ The humans on Safehold managed to avoid detection by reverting to a pre-electrical\
        \ and pre-electronics technology base and incorporating that into a religious\
        \ belief system which forbade any higher technology on penalty of death.\r\
