description: "Earth, 2144. Jack is an anti-patent scientist turned drug pirate, traversing\
  \ the world in a submarine as a pharmaceutical Robin Hood, fabricating cheap scrips\
  \ for poor people who can\u2019t otherwise afford them. But her latest drug hack\
  \ has left a trail of lethal overdoses as people become addicted to their work,\
  \ doing repetitive tasks until they become unsafe or insane.<p>Hot on her trail,\
  \ an unlikely pair: Eliasz, a brooding military agent, and his robotic partner,\
  \ Paladin. As they race to stop information about the sinister origins of Jack\u2019\
  s drug from getting out, they begin to form an uncommonly close bond that neither\
  \ of them fully understand.</p><p>And underlying it all is one fundamental question:\
  \ Is freedom possible in a culture where everything, even people, can be owned?</p>"
