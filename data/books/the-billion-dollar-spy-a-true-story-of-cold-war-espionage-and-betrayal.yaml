description: "<b>From the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning history <i>The Dead\
  \ Hand</i> comes the riveting story of a spy who cracked open the Soviet military\
  \ research establishment and a\_penetrating portrait of the CIA\u2019s Moscow station,\
  \ an outpost of daring espionage in the last years of the Cold War</b><br />\_<br\
  \ />\_\_\_While driving out of the American embassy in Moscow on the evening of\
  \ February 16, 1978, the chief of the CIA\u2019s Moscow station heard a knock on\
  \ his car window. A man on the curb handed him an envelope whose contents stunned\
  \ U.S. intelligence: details of top-secret Soviet research and developments in military\
  \ technology that were totally unknown to the United States. In the years that followed,\
  \ the man, Adolf Tolkachev, an engineer in a Soviet military design bureau, used\
  \ his high-level access to hand over tens of thousands of pages of technical secrets.\
  \ His revelations allowed America to reshape its weapons systems to defeat Soviet\
  \ radar on the ground and in the air, giving the United States near total superiority\
  \ in the skies over Europe.<br />\_\_\_One of the most valuable spies to work for\
  \ the United States in the four decades of global confrontation with the Soviet\
  \ Union, Tolkachev took enormous personal risks\u2014but so did the Americans. The\
  \ CIA had long struggled to recruit and run agents in Moscow, and Tolkachev was\
  \ a singular breakthrough. Using spy cameras and secret codes as well as face-to-face\
  \ meetings in parks and on street corners, Tolkachev and his handlers succeeded\
  \ for years in eluding the feared KGB in its own backyard, until the day came when\
  \ a shocking betrayal put them all at risk.\_<br />\_\_\_Drawing on previously secret\
  \ documents obtained from the CIA and on interviews with participants, David Hoffman\
  \ has created an unprecedented and poignant portrait of Tolkachev, a man motivated\
  \ by the depredations of the Soviet state to master the craft of spying against\
  \ his own country. Stirring, unpredictable, and at times unbearably tense, <i>The\
  \ Billion Dollar Spy</i> is a brilliant feat of reporting that unfolds like an espionage\
  \ thriller."
