description: "<b>In New York Times bestselling author Daniel Suarez's latest space-tech\
  \ thriller, a group of pioneering astropreneurs must overcome never-before-attempted\
  \ engineering challenges to rescue colleagues stranded at a distant asteroid\u2014\
  kicking off a new space race in which Earth's climate crisis could well hang in\
  \ the balance.</b><br /> <br />When unforeseen circumstances during an innovative\u2014\
  and unsanctioned\u2014commercial asteroid-mining mission leave two crew members\
  \ stranded, those who make it back must engineer a rescue, all while navigating\
  \ a shifting web of global political alliances and renewed Cold War tensions. With\
  \ Earth governments consumed by the ravages of climate change and unable to take\
  \ the risks necessary to make rapid progress in space, the crew must build their\
  \ own nextgen spacecraft capable of mounting a rescue in time for the asteroid's\
  \ next swing by Earth.<br /> <br />In the process they'll need to establish the\
  \ first spin-gravity station in deep space, the first orbiting solar power satellite\
  \ and refinery, and historic infrastructure on the moon's surface\u2014all of which\
  \ could alleviate a deepening ecological, political, and economic crisis back on\
  \ Earth, and prove that space-based industry is not only profitable, but possibly\
  \ humanity's best hope for a livable, peaceful future."
