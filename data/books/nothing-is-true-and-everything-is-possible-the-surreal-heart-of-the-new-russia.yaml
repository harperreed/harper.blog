description: "In the new Russia, even dictatorship is a reality show.<br /><br />Professional\
  \ killers with the souls of artists, would-be theater directors turned Kremlin puppet-masters,\
  \ suicidal supermodels, Hell\u2019s Angels who hallucinate themselves as holy warriors,\
  \ and oligarch revolutionaries: welcome to the glittering, surreal heart of twenty-first-century\
  \ Russia. It is a world erupting with new money and new power, changing so fast\
  \ it breaks all sense of reality, home to a form of dictatorship\u2014far subtler\
  \ than twentieth-century strains\u2014that is rapidly rising to challenge the West.<br\
  \ /><br />When British producer Peter Pomerantsev plunges into the booming Russian\
  \ TV industry, he gains access to every nook and corrupt cranny of the country.\
  \ He is brought to smoky rooms for meetings with propaganda gurus running the nerve-center\
  \ of the Russian media machine, and visits Siberian mafia-towns and the salons of\
  \ the international super-rich in London and the US. As the Putin regime becomes\
  \ more aggressive, Pomerantsev finds himself drawn further into the system."
