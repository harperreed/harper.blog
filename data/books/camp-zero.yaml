description: "<b>In a near-future northern settlement, a handful of climate change\
  \ survivors find their fates intertwined in this mesmerizing and transportive novel\
  \ in the vein of <i>Station Eleven</i> and <i>The Power</i>.</b><br /><br />In the\
  \ far north of Canada sits Camp Zero, an American building project hiding many secrets.<br\
  \ /> <br />Desperate to help her climate-displaced Korean immigrant mother, Rose\
  \ agrees to travel to Camp Zero and spy on its architect in exchange for housing.\
  \ She arrives at the same time as another newcomer, a college professor named Grant\
  \ who is determined to flee his wealthy family\u2019s dark legacy. Gradually, they\
  \ realize that there is more to the architect than previously thought, and a disturbing\
  \ mystery lurks beneath the surface of the camp. At the same time, rumors abound\
  \ of an elite group of women soldiers living and working at a nearby Cold War-era\
  \ climate research station. What are they doing there? And who is leading them?<br\
  \ /> <br />An electrifying page-turner where nothing is as it seems, <i>Camp Zero</i>\
  \ cleverly explores how the intersection of gender, class, and migration will impact\
  \ who and what will survive in a warming world."
