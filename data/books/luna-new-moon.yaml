description: The Moon wants to kill you. <br /><br />Maybe it will kill you when the
  per diem for your allotted food, water, and air runs out, just before you hit paydirt.
  Maybe it will kill you when you are trapped between the reigning corporations-the
  Five Dragons-in a foolish gamble against a futuristic feudal society. On the Moon,
  you must fight for every inch you want to gain. And that is just what Adriana Corta
  did. <br /><br />As the leader of the Moon's newest "dragon," Adriana has wrested
  control of the Moon's Helium-3 industry from the Mackenzie Metal corporation and
  fought to earn her family's new status. Now, in the twilight of her life, Adriana
  finds her corporation-Corta Helio-confronted by the many enemies she made during
  her meteoric rise. If the Corta family is to survive, Adriana's five children must
  defend their mother's empire from her many enemies... and each other.
