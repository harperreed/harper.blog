description: "The Free Navy \u2013 a violent group of Belters in black-market military\
  \ ships \u2013 has crippled the Earth and begun a campaign of piracy and violence\
  \ among the outer planets. The colony ships heading for the thousand new worlds\
  \ on the far side of the alien ring gates are easy prey, and no single navy remains\
  \ strong enough to protect them.<br /><br />James Holden and his crew know the strengths\
  \ and weaknesses of this new force better than anyone. Outnumbered and outgunned,\
  \ the embattled remnants of the old political powers call on the Rocinante for a\
  \ desperate mission to reach Medina Station at the heart of the gate network.<br\
  \ /><br />But the new alliances are as flawed as the old, and the struggle for power\
  \ has only just begun. As the chaos grows, an alien mystery deepens. Pirate fleets,\
  \ mutiny, and betrayal may be the least of the Rocinante\u2019s problems. And in\
  \ the uncanny spaces past the ring gates, the choices of a few damaged and desperate\
  \ people may determine the fate of more than just humanity."
