description: "From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell\
  \ Labs\u2014officially, the research and development wing of AT&amp;T\u2014was the\
  \ biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the\
  \ transistor to the laser, it\u2019s hard to find an aspect of modern life that\
  \ hasn\u2019t been touched by Bell Labs.<br /><br />Why did so many transformative\
  \ ideas come from Bell Labs? In The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner traces the origins\
  \ of some of the twentieth century\u2019s most important inventions and delivers\
  \ a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this\
  \ is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric\
  \ men\u2014Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker\u2014\
  who spent their careers at Bell Labs. Their job was to research and develop the\
  \ future of communications. Small-town boys, childhood hobbyists, oddballs: they\
  \ give the lie to the idea that Bell Labs was a grim cathedral of top-down command\
  \ and control.<br /><br />Gertner brings to life the powerful alchemy of the forces\
  \ at work behind Bell Labs inventions, teasing out the intersections between science,\
  \ business, and society. He distills the lessons that abide: how to recruit and\
  \ nurture young talent; how to organize and lead fractious employees; how to find\
  \ solutions to the most stubbornly vexing problems; how to transform a scientific\
  \ discovery into a marketable product, then make it even better, cheaper, or both.\
  \ Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way\
  \ to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation.\
  \ Here, after all, was where the foundational ideas on the management of innovation\
  \ were born.<br />The Idea Factory is the story of the origins of modern communications\
  \ and the beginnings of the information age\u2014a deeply human story of extraordinary\
  \ men who were given extraordinary means\u2014time, space, funds, and access to\
  \ one another\u2014and edged the world into a new dimension."
