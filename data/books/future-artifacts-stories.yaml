description: "Brutal. Devastating. Dangerous.<br /><br />Join an investigation into\
  \ a cruel and heartless leader \u2026 crawl through filth and mud to escape biological\
  \ warfare \u2026 team up with time-traveling soldiers faced with potentially life-altering\
  \ instructions.<br /><br />Kameron Hurley, award-winning author and expert in the\
  \ future of war and resistance movements, has created eighteen exhilarating tales\
  \ giving glimpses into the warfare of tomorrow.<br /><br />A bleak future, yet there\
  \ is hope for us. With Hurley\u2019s characteristic grim optimism, her characters\
  \ fight for what they believe is right. They exhibit degrees of humanity only possible\
  \ in the worst of circumstances. It is these characters, driven by a murky sense\
  \ of honor and written with sincere, deep empathy, that make Future Artifacts: Stories\
  \ a powerful collection you won\u2019t soon forget."
