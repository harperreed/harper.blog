description: Reading the headlines, one could easily conclude that many of today's
  technology-driven ventures are dying because of a lack of funds or a shortage of
  business opportunities. But what really lies at the root cause of their demise is
  a technocentric disregard for strategy and general management principles.Business
  @ the Speed of Stupid brings to light many of the myths that stymie unwary investors,
  entrepreneurs, and managers who are seeking to turn a profit in the digital economy.
  It highlights why smart entrepreneurs buy into dim-witted business beliefs and exposes
  the "big lies" that have crippled so many companies. With ultimate know-how, verve,
  and humor, Dan Burke and Alan Morrison reveal why brilliant engineers don't always
  make brilliant business leaders, how innovation is far less important than customers
  and quality, and that, yes, you do need to be profitable to survive on the Web.
  Bringing realism and experience to the table to counteract the lingering technology
  industry hype, Business @ the Speed of Stupid explains how to survive and profit
  in the next phase of our technology-driven economy.
