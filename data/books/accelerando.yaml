description: 'The Singularity. It is the era of the posthuman. Artificial intelligences
  have surpassed the limits of human intellect. Biotechnological beings have rendered
  people all but extinct. Molecular nanotechnology runs rampant, replicating and reprogramming
  at will. Contact with extraterrestrial life grows more imminent with each new day.<br
  /><br />Struggling to survive and thrive in this accelerated world are three generations
  of the Macx clan: Manfred, an entrepreneur dealing in intelligence amplification
  technology whose mind is divided between his physical environment and the Internet;
  his daughter, Amber, on the run from her domineering mother, seeking her fortune
  in the outer system as an indentured astronaut; and Sirhan, Amber''s son, who finds
  his destiny linked to the fate of all of humanity.<br /><br />For something is systemically
  dismantling the nine planets of the solar system. Something beyond human comprehension.
  Something that has no use for biological life in any form.'
