description: "<b>'In this remarkable book, David Rowan tells a story of transformation:\
  \ how an organisation has found a new way of doing things through innovation driven\
  \ by ruthless entrepreneurial imagination. What is especially useful is that he\
  \ does not just stick with small startups, let alone dreamy \u201Cinventors\u201D\
  . He finds innovation in big companies and even within governments.' - Matt Ridley,\
  \ <i>The Times</i></b><br />__________________________<br />David Rowan travels\
  \ the globe in search of the most exciting and pioneering startups building the\
  \ future. He\u2019s got to know the founders of WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Google, Spotify,\
  \ Xiaomi, Didi, Nest, Twitter and countless other ambitious entrepreneurs disrupting\
  \ businesses in almost every sector. And yet too often the companies they\u2019\
  re disrupting don\u2019t get it. They think they can innovate through jargon: with\
  \ talk of change agents and co-creation gurus, ideas portals and webinars, make-a-thons\
  \ and hackfests, paradigm shifts and pilgrimages to Silicon Valley. It\u2019s mostly\
  \ pointless innovation theatre \u2014 corporate nonsense that has little to do with\
  \ delivering real change. But during this quest he's also discovered some genuinely\
  \ exciting and transformative approaches to innovation, often in places you might\
  \ least expect.<br /><br />Get ready for:<br />\xB7 The airline that rewards passengers\
  \ for walking their dog<br />\xB7 The bank that performs surgery<br />\xB7 The country\
  \ that\u2019s an app store <br />And many more.<br /><br />Packed full of tips for\
  \ anyone looking for radical ways to adapt and thrive in the digital age, this carefully\
  \ curated selection of stories will reveal ideas for creating genuine innovation\
  \ from some of the world\u2019s most inspiring leaders.<br />___________________________"
