description: "John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his\
  \ wife's grave. Then he joined the army.<br /><br />The good news is that humanity\
  \ finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live\
  \ on are scarce\u2014and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So:\
  \ we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate.\
  \ Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.<br\
  \ /><br />Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the\
  \ hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement\
  \ age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who\
  \ carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth\
  \ and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive,\
  \ you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won\
  \ colony planets.<br /><br />John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest\
  \ idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far,\
  \ far harder than he can imagine\u2014and what he will become is far stranger."

      description: "<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author John Scalzi takes you\
        \ on an epic romp of galactic conquest and exploration in the Old Man's War\
        \ series. Humanity has reached the stars, but have been engaged in wars with\
        \ alien races for decades over habitable planets. The Colonial Defense Force\
        \ fights for Earth. To join the CDF, a recruit must have reached retirement\
        \ age. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge\
        \ and skills of decades of living. Soldiers are taken off Earth and never\
        \ allowed to return. They'll serve time at the front. And if they survive,\
        \ they'll be given a generous homestead on one of Earth's hard-won colony\
        \ planets.\n    \n    \n    Old Man\u2019s War, The Last Colony and Zoe\u2019\
        s Tale were each nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in their respective\
        \ years. Zoe\u2019s Tale was additionally nominated for the Andre Norton Award\
        \ for Best Young Adult Science Fiction/Fantasy. The Ghost Brigades was nominated\
        \ for the Prometheus Award. Old Man\u2019s War was the winner of the Geffen\
        \ Award in Israel; The Last Colony the recipient of the Seiun Award in Japan.\n\
        \    \n    Old Man\u2019s War was ranked #1 on the Tor.com reader poll of\
        \ the best science fiction and fantasy novels of 2000 \u2013 2010. It is listed\
        \ on the NPR.com reader poll of the Top 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy Books/Series."
