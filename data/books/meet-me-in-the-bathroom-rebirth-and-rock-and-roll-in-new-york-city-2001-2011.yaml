description: "Joining the ranks of the classics <em>Please Kill Me, Our Band Could\
  \ Be Your Life</em>, and <em>Can\u2019t Stop Won\u2019t Stop</em>, an intriguing\
  \ oral history of the post-9/11 decline of the old-guard music industry and rebirth\
  \ of the New York rock scene, led by a group of iconoclastic rock bands.<br /><br\
  \ />In the second half of the twentieth-century New York was the source of new sounds,\
  \ including the Greenwich Village folk scene, punk and new wave, and hip-hop. But\
  \ as the end of the millennium neared, cutting-edge bands began emerging from Seattle,\
  \ Austin, and London, pushing New York further from the epicenter. The behemoth\
  \ music industry, too, found itself in free fall, under siege from technology. Then\
  \ 9/11/2001 plunged the country into a state of uncertainty and war\u2014and a dozen\
  \ New York City bands that had been honing their sound and style in relative obscurity\
  \ suddenly became symbols of glamour for a young, web-savvy, forward-looking generation\
  \ in need of an anthem.<br /><br /><em>Meet Me in the Bathroom</em> charts the transformation\
  \ of the New York music scene in the first decade of the 2000s, the bands behind\
  \ it\u2014including The Strokes, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, LCD Soundsystem, Interpol,\
  \ and Vampire Weekend\u2014and the cultural forces that shaped it, from the Internet\
  \ to a booming real estate market that forced artists out of the Lower East Side\
  \ to Williamsburg. Drawing on 200 original interviews with James Murphy, Julian\
  \ Casablancas, Karen O, Ezra Koenig, and many others musicians, artists, journalists,\
  \ bloggers, photographers, managers, music executives, groupies, models, movie stars,\
  \ and DJs who lived through this explosive time, journalist Lizzy Goodman offers\
  \ a fascinating portrait of a time and a place that gave birth to a new era in modern\
  \ rock-and-roll."
