description: "<b>Oryx and Crake</b> is at once an unforgettable love story and a compelling\
  \ vision of the future. Snowman, known as Jimmy before mankind was overwhelmed by\
  \ a plague, is struggling to survive in a world where he may be the last human,\
  \ and mourning the loss of his best friend, Crake, and the beautiful and elusive\
  \ Oryx whom they both loved. In search of answers, Snowman embarks on a journey\u2013\
  with the help of the green-eyed Children of Crake\u2013through the lush wilderness\
  \ that was so recently a great city, until powerful corporations took mankind on\
  \ an uncontrolled genetic engineering ride. Margaret Atwood projects us into a near\
  \ future that is both all too familiar and beyond our imagining."
