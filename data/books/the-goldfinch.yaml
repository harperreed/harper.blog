description: 'It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously
  survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken
  in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park
  Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don''t know how to talk to him, and tormented
  above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that
  reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws
  Theo into the underworld of art.<br /><br />As an adult, Theo moves silkily between
  the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where
  he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more
  dangerous circle.<br /><br /><i>The Goldfinch</i> combines vivid characters, mesmerizing
  language, and suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher''s calm the deepest mysteries
  of love, identity, and art. It is an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession,
  survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.'
