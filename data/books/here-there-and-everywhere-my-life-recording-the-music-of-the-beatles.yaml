description: "Geoff Emerick became an assistant engineer at the legendary Abbey Road\
  \ Studios in 1962 at age fifteen, and was present as a new band called the Beatles\
  \ recorded their first songs. He later worked with the Beatles as they recorded\
  \ their singles \u201CShe Loves You\u201D and \u201CI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201D\
  \ the songs that would propel them to international superstardom. In 1964 he would\
  \ witness the transformation of this young and playful group from Liverpool into\
  \ professional, polished musicians as they put to tape classic songs such as \u201C\
  Eight Days A Week\u201D and \u201CI Feel Fine.\u201D Then, in 1966, at age nineteen,\
  \ Geoff Emerick became the Beatles\u2019 chief engineer, the man responsible for\
  \ their distinctive sound as they recorded the classic album <i>Revolver</i>, in\
  \ which they pioneered innovative recording techniques that changed the course of\
  \ rock history. Emerick would also engineer the monumental <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> and\
  \ <i>Abbey Road</i> albums, considered by many the greatest rock recordings of all\
  \ time. In <i>Here, There and Everywhere</i> he reveals the creative process of\
  \ the band in the studio, and describes how he achieved the sounds on their most\
  \ famous songs. Emerick also brings to light the personal dynamics of the band,\
  \ from the relentless (and increasingly mean-spirited) competition between Lennon\
  \ and McCartney to the infighting and frustration that eventually brought a bitter\
  \ end to the greatest rock band the world has ever known.<br /><br />"
