description: "<b>A wondrous debut from an extraordinary new voice in nonfiction, <i>Why\

  \ was a taxonomist, a man possessed with bringing order to the natural world. In\

  \ known to humans in his day. But the more of the hidden blueprint of life he uncovered,\
  \ the harder the universe seemed to try to thwart him. His specimen collections\
  \ were demolished by lightning, by fire, and eventually by the 1906 San Francisco\
  \ earthquake\u2014which sent more than a thousand of his discoveries, housed in\
  \ fragile glass jars, plummeting to the floor. In an instant, his life\u2019s work\
  \ was shattered.<br /> <br />Many might have given up, given in to despair. But\
  \ Jordan? He surveyed the wreckage at his feet, found the first fish he recognized,\
  \ and confidently began to rebuild his collection. And this time, he introduced\
