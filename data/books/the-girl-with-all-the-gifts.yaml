description: Melanie is a very special girl. Dr. Caldwell calls her "our little genius."<br
  /><br />Every morning, Melanie waits in her cell to be collected for class. When
  they come for her, Sergeant Parks keeps his gun pointing at her while two of his
  people strap her into the wheelchair. She thinks they don't like her. She jokes
  that she won't bite, but they don't laugh.<br /><br />Melanie loves school. She
  loves learning about spelling and sums and the world outside the classroom and the
  children's cells. She tells her favorite teacher all the things she'll do when she
  grows up. Melanie doesn't know why this makes Miss Justineau look sad.<br /><br
  /><i>The Girl with All the Gifts</i> is a sensational thriller, perfect for fans
  of Stephen King, Justin Cronin, and Neil Gaiman.
