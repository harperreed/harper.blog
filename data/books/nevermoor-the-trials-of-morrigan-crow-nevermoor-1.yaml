description: '<b>A breathtaking, enchanting new series by debut author Jessica Townsend,
  about a cursed girl who escapes death and finds herself in a magical world--but
  is then tested beyond her wildest imagination </b><br /><br />Morrigan Crow is cursed.
  Having been born on Eventide, the unluckiest day for any child to be born, she''s
  blamed for all local misfortunes, from hailstorms to heart attacks--and, worst of
  all, the curse means that Morrigan is doomed to die at midnight on her eleventh
  birthday.<br /><br />But as Morrigan awaits her fate, a strange and remarkable man
  named Jupiter North appears. Chased by black-smoke hounds and shadowy hunters on
  horseback, he whisks her away into the safety of a secret, magical city called Nevermoor.<br
  />It''s then that Morrigan discovers Jupiter has chosen her to contend for a place
  in the city''s most prestigious organization: the Wundrous Society. In order to
  join, she must compete in four difficult and dangerous trials against hundreds of
  other children, each boasting an extraordinary talent that sets them apart--an extraordinary
  talent that Morrigan insists she does not have. To stay in the safety of Nevermoor
  for good, Morrigan will need to find a way to pass the tests--or she''ll have to
  leave the city to confront her deadly fate.'
