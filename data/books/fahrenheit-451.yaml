description: "Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 1451673264 (ISBN13: 9781451673265)<br /><br\
  \ /><b>Ray Bradbury\u2019s internationally acclaimed novel Fahrenheit 451 is a masterwork\
  \ of twentieth-century literature set in a bleak, dystopian future. </b><br /><br\
  \ />Guy Montag is a fireman. In his world, where television rules and literature\
  \ is on the brink of extinction, firemen start fires rather than put them out. His\
  \ job is to destroy the most illegal of commodities, the printed book, along with\
  \ the houses in which they are hidden. <br /><br />Montag never questions the destruction\
  \ and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred,\
  \ who spends all day with her television \u201Cfamily.\u201D But then he meets an\
  \ eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people\
  \ didn\u2019t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the\
  \ ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television. <br /><br />When\
  \ Mildred attempts suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins to question\
  \ everything he has ever known. He starts hiding books in his home, and when his\
  \ pilfering is discovered, the fireman has to run for his life."
