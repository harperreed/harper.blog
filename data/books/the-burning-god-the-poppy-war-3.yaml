description: "<strong>The exciting end to The Poppy War trilogy, R. F. Kuang\u2019\
  s acclaimed, award-winning epic fantasy that combines the history of twentieth-century\
  \ China with a gripping world of gods and monsters, to devastating, enthralling\
  \ effect.</strong><br /><br />After saving her nation of Nikan from foreign invaders\
  \ and battling the evil Empress Su Daji in a brutal civil war, Fang Runin was betrayed\
  \ by allies and left for dead.\_<br /><br />Despite her losses, Rin hasn\u2019t\
  \ given up on those for whom she has sacrificed so much\u2014the people of the southern\
  \ provinces and especially Tikany, the village that is her home. Returning to her\
  \ roots, Rin meets difficult challenges\u2014and unexpected opportunities. While\
  \ her new allies in the Southern Coalition leadership are sly and untrustworthy,\
  \ Rin quickly realizes that the real power in Nikan lies with the millions of common\
  \ people who thirst for vengeance and revere her as a goddess of salvation.\_<br\
  \ /><br />Backed by the masses and her Southern Army, Rin will use every weapon\
  \ to defeat the Dragon Republic, the colonizing Hesperians, and all who threaten\
  \ the shamanic arts and their practitioners. As her power and influence grows, though,\
  \ will she be strong enough to resist the Phoenix\u2019s intoxicating voice urging\
  \ her to burn the world and everything in it?\_<br /><br /><br />"
