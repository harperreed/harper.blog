description: <b>A hostile fleet. A planet killer. And one shot to make it right.<br
  /><br />In this gripping new military science-fiction novel, a battle-tested infantry
  squad pursues an inhuman enemy into the vacuum of space.</b><br /><br />Maseo Kaytu's
  squad is yanked from a much-deserved furlough by an emergency deployment off-planet.
  But why is Command sending grunts into the "Big Empty"? Without CAVs, without backup--hell,
  without gravity--the squad is more vulnerable than ever. Tasked with a mission that
  only they can complete, they track the enemy across the killing vastness of space,
  from a bizarre interplanetary warehouse to the hidden heart of a research habitation...and
  beyond. <br /><br />But the enemy is tracking them, too. Scanning, calculating,
  preparing. Kaytu joined the military to redeem the bad choices of his past, yet
  now--trapped in hostile territory--he learns that soldiers face the hardest choices
  of all.
