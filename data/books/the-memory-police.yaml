description: "A haunting Orwellian novel about the terrors of state surveillance,\
  \ from the acclaimed author of The Housekeeper and the Professor.<br /><br />On\
  \ an unnamed island off an unnamed coast, objects are disappearing: first hats,\
  \ then ribbons, birds, roses\u2014until things become much more serious. Most of\
  \ the island's inhabitants are oblivious to these changes, while those few imbued\
  \ with the power to recall the lost objects live in fear of the draconian Memory\
  \ Police, who are committed to ensuring that what has disappeared remains forgotten.<br\
  \ /><br />When a young woman who is struggling to maintain her career as a novelist\
  \ discovers that her editor is in danger from the Memory Police, she concocts a\
  \ plan to hide him beneath her floorboards. As fear and loss close in around them,\
  \ they cling to her writing as the last way of preserving the past.<br /><br />A\
  \ surreal, provocative fable about the power of memory and the trauma of loss, The\
  \ Memory Police is a stunning new work from one of the most exciting contemporary\
  \ authors writing in any language."
