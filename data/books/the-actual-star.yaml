description: "<strong>David Mitchell\u2019s <em>Cloud Atlas </em>meets Octavia Butler\u2019\
  s Earthseed series, as acclaimed author Monica Byrne (<em>The Girl in the Road</em>)\
  \ spins a brilliant multigenerational saga spanning two thousand years, from the\
  \ collapse of the ancient Maya to a far-future utopia on the brink of civil war.</strong><br\
  \ /><br /><em>The Actual Star</em> takes readers on a journey over thousands of\
  \ years and six continents \u2014collapsing three separate timelines into one cave\
  \ in the Belizean jungle.<br /><br />An epic saga of three reincarnated souls, this\
  \ novel demonstrates the entanglements of tradition and progress, sister and stranger,\
  \ love and hate. The book jumps forward and backward in time among a pair of twins\
  \ who ruled a Maya kingdom, a young American on a trip of self-discovery, and two\
  \ dangerous charismatics in a conflict that will determine the fate of the few humans\
  \ left on Earth after massive climate change.<br /><br />In each era, age-old questions\
  \ about existence and belonging and identity converge deep underground. Because\
  \ only in complete darkness can one truly see the stars."
