description: "Lois Clary, a software engineer at a San Francisco robotics company,\
  \ codes all day and collapses at night. When her favourite sandwich shop closes\
  \ up, the owners leave her with the starter for their mouthwatering sourdough bread.<br\
  \ /> Lois becomes the unlikely hero tasked to care for it, bake with it and keep\
  \ this needy colony of microorganisms alive. \_Soon she is baking loaves daily and\
  \ taking them to the farmer's market, where an exclusive close-knit club runs the\
  \ show. <br /> When Lois discovers another, more secret market, aiming to fuse food\
  \ and technology, a whole other world opens up. But who are these people, exactly?"
