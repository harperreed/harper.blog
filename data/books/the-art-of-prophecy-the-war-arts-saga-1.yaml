description: "<b>An epic fantasy ode to martial arts and magic\u2014the story of a\
  \ spoiled hero, an exacting grandmaster, and an immortal god-king from the #1 New\
  \ York Times bestselling author of <i>The Lives of Tao</i>.</b><br /><br />It has\
  \ been foretold: A child will rise to defeat the Eternal Khan, a cruel immortal\
  \ god-king, and save the kingdom. <br /> <br />The hero: Jian, who has been raised\
  \ since birth in luxury and splendor, celebrated before he has won a single battle.\
  \ <br /> <br />But the prophecy was wrong. <br /> <br />Because when Taishi, the\
  \ greatest war artist of her generation, arrives to evaluate the prophesied hero,\
  \ she finds a spoiled brat unprepared to face his destiny. <br /> <br />But the\
  \ only force more powerful than fate is Taishi herself. Possessed of an iron will,\
  \ a sharp tongue\u2014and an unexpectedly soft heart\u2014Taishi will find a way\
  \ to forge Jian into the weapon and leader he needs to be in order to fulfill his\
  \ legend. <br /> <br />What follows is a journey more wondrous than any prophecy\
  \ can foresee: a story of master and student, assassin and revolutionary, of fallen\
  \ gods and broken prophecies, and of a war between kingdoms, and love and friendship\
  \ between deadly rivals."
