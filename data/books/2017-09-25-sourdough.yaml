description: "Lois Clary is a software engineer at General Dexterity, a San Francisco\
  \ robotics company with world-changing ambitions. She codes all day and collapses\
  \ at night, her human contact limited to the two brothers who run the neighborhood\
  \ hole-in-the-wall from which she orders dinner every evening. Then, disaster! Visa\
  \ issues. The brothers close up shop, and fast. But they have one last delivery\
  \ for Lois: their culture, the sourdough starter used to bake their bread. She must\
  \ keep it alive, they tell her\u2014feed it daily, play it music, and learn to bake\
  \ with it.<br /><br />Lois is no baker, but she could use a roommate, even if it\
  \ is a needy colony of microorganisms. Soon, not only is she eating her own homemade\
  \ bread, she\u2019s providing loaves daily to the General Dexterity cafeteria. The\
  \ company chef urges her to take her product to the farmer\u2019s market, and a\
  \ whole new world opens up.<br /><br />When Lois comes before the jury that decides\
  \ who sells what at Bay Area markets, she encounters a close-knit club with no appetite\
  \ for new members. But then, an alternative emerges: a secret market that aims to\
  \ fuse food and technology. But who are these people, exactly?"
