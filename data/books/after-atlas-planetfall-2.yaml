description: "<b>Acclaimed author Emma Newman returns to the captivating universe\
  \ she created in <i>Planetfall</i> with a stunning science fiction mystery where\
  \ one man\u2019s murder is much more than it seems...</b><br /><br />Govcorp detective\
  \ Carlos Moreno was only a baby when <i>Atlas </i> left Earth to seek truth among\
  \ the stars. But in that moment, the course of Carlos\u2019s entire life changed.\
  \ <i>Atlas </i> is what took his mother away; what made his father lose hope; what\
  \ led Alejandro Casales, leader of the religious cult known as the Circle, to his\
  \ door. And now, on the eve of the fortieth anniversary of <i>Atlas</i>\u2019s departure,\
  \ it\u2019s got something to do why Casales was found dead in his hotel room\u2014\
  and why Carlos is the man in charge of the investigation.<br /><br />To figure out\
  \ who killed one of the most powerful men on Earth, Carlos is supposed to put aside\
  \ his personal history. But the deeper he delves into the case, the more he realizes\
  \ that escaping the past is not so easy. There\u2019s more to Casales\u2019s death\
  \ than meets the eye, and something much more sinister to the legacy of <i>Atlas\
  \ </i> than anyone realizes..."
