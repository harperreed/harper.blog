  be forever considered a triumph of the imagination. Set on the desert planet Arrakis,
  <b>Dune</b> is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, who would become the mysterious
  man known as Muad''Dib. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family--and
  would bring to fruition humankind''s most ancient and unattainable dream.<br />A
  stunning blend of adventure and mysticism, environmentalism and politics, Dune won
  the first Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and formed the basis of what it undoubtedly
  the grandest epic in science fiction.'
