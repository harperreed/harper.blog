description: 'His life was like a recurring nightmare: a train to nowhere. But an
  ordinary life has a way of taking an extraordinary turn. Add a girl whose ears are
  so exquisite that, when uncovered, they improve sex a thousand-fold, a runaway friend,
  a right-wing politico, an ovine-obsessed professor and a manic-depressive in a sheep
  outfit, implicate them in a hunt for a sheep, that may or may not be running the
  world, and the upshot is another singular masterpiece from Japan''s finest novelist.'
