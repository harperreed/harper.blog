description: "The first comprehensive oral history of September 11, 2001\u2014a panoramic\
  \ narrative woven from the voices of Americans on the front lines of an unprecedented\
  \ national trauma.<br /><br />Over the past eighteen years, monumental literature\
  \ has been published about 9/11, from Lawrence Wright\u2019s <i>The Looming Tower</i>,\
  \ which traced the rise of al-Qaeda, to <i>The 9/11 Commission Report,</i> the government\u2019\
  s definitive factual retrospective of the attacks. But one perspective has been\
  \ missing up to this point\u2014a 360-degree account of the day told through the\
  \ voices of the people who experienced it.<br /><br />Now, in <i>The Only Plane\
  \ in the Sky</i>, award-winning journalist and bestselling historian Garrett Graff\
  \ tells the story of the day as it was lived\u2014in the words of those who lived\
  \ it. Drawing on never-before-published transcripts, recently declassified documents,\
  \ original interviews, and oral histories from nearly five hundred government officials,\
  \ first responders, witnesses, survivors, friends, and family members, Graff paints\
  \ the most vivid and human portrait of the September 11 attacks yet.<br /><br />Beginning\
  \ in the predawn hours of airports in the Northeast, we meet the ticket agents who\
  \ unknowingly usher terrorists onto their flights, and the flight attendants inside\
  \ the hijacked planes. In New York City, first responders confront a scene of unimaginable\
  \ horror at the Twin Towers. From a secret bunker underneath the White House, officials\
  \ watch for incoming planes on radar. Aboard the small number of unarmed fighter\
  \ jets in the air, pilots make a pact to fly into a hijacked airliner if necessary\
  \ to bring it down. In the skies above Pennsylvania, civilians aboard United Flight\
  \ 93 make the ultimate sacrifice in their place. Then, as the day moves forward\
  \ and flights are grounded nationwide, Air Force One circles the country alone,\
  \ its passengers isolated and afraid.<br /><br />More than simply a collection of\
  \ eyewitness testimonies, <i>The Only Plane in the Sky</i> is the historic narrative\
  \ of how ordinary people grappled with extraordinary events in real time: the father\
  \ and son working in the North Tower, caught on different ends of the impact zone;\
  \ the firefighter searching for his wife who works at the World Trade Center; the\
  \ operator of in-flight telephone calls who promises to share a passenger\u2019\
  s last words with his family; the beloved FDNY chaplain who bravely performs last\
  \ rites for the dying, losing his own life when the Towers collapse; and the generals\
  \ at the Pentagon who break down and weep when they are barred from rushing into\
  \ the burning building to try to rescue their colleagues.<br /><br />At once a powerful\
  \ tribute to the courage of everyday Americans and an essential addition to the\
  \ literature of 9/11, <i>The Only Plane in the Sky</i> weaves together the unforgettable\
  \ personal experiences of the men and women who found themselves caught at the center\
  \ of an unprecedented human drama. The result is a unique, profound, and searing\
  \ exploration of humanity on a day that changed the course of history, and all of\
  \ our lives."
