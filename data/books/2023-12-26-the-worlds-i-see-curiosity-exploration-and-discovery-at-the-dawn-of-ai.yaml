description: "<i>Wired</i> called Dr. Fei-Fei Li \u201Cone of a tiny group of scientists\u2014\
  a group perhaps small enough to fit around a kitchen table\u2014who are responsible\
  \ for AI\u2019s recent remarkable advances.\u201D<br /><br />Known to the world\
  \ as the creator of ImageNet, a key catalyst of modern artificial intelligence,\
  \ Dr. Li has spent more than two decades at the forefront of the field. But her\
  \ career in science was improbable from the start. As immigrants, her family faced\
  \ a difficult transition from China\u2019s middle class to American poverty. And\
  \ their lives were made all the harder as they struggled to care for her ailing\
  \ mother, who was working tirelessly to help them all gain a foothold in their new\
  \ land.<br /><br />Fei-Fei\u2019s adolescent knack for physics endured, however,\
  \ and positioned her to make a crucial contribution to the breakthrough we now call\
  \ AI, placing her at the center of a global transformation. Over the last decades,\
  \ her work has brought her face-to-face with the extraordinary possibilities\u2014\

  \ of a scientist at work and a thrillingly clear explanation of what artificial\
  \ intelligence actually is\u2014and how it came to be. Emotionally raw and intellectually\
