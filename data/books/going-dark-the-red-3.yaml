description: "In the third book in The Red Trilogy, former Army Lt. James Shelley\
  \ becomes a black ops sniper working for the Red\u2014a suspected rogue artificial\
  \ intelligence that is ripped from today\u2019s headlines.<br /><br />James Shelley\
  \ has left his lover, Delphi, and his companion-in-arms, Jayne Vasquez, with a fortune\
  \ acquired from a fallen oligarch. They believe him to be dead, and he doesn\u2019\
  t try to set the record straight. His long-running question has been answered: There\
  \ are other soldiers like him who have served the purposes of the Red\u2014and he\
  \ has accepted his place among them. As a soldier of the Red he pursues covert missions\
  \ designed to nudge history away from existential threats\u2014but that doesn\u2019\
  t mean the world is growing more orderly. It\u2019s only in the froth of a \u201C\
  managed chaos\u201D that human potential can grow and thrive. Shelley\u2019s missions\
  \ eventually take him into orbit\u2014and into conflict with those he loves\u2014\
  Delphi and Jaynie\u2014who are determined to escape the influence of the Red."
