description: It is 2140. <br /><br />The waters rose, submerging New York City. <br
  /><br />But the residents adapted and it remained the bustling, vibrant metropolis
  it had always been. Though changed forever.<br /><br />Every street became a canal.
  Every skyscraper an island.<br /><br />Through the eyes of the varied inhabitants
  of one building, Kim Stanley Robinson shows us how one of our great cities will
  change with the rising tides.<br /><br />And how we too will change.
