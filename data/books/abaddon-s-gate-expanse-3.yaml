description: 'Abaddon''s Gate is the third book in the New York Times bestselling
  Expanse series. <br /><br />For generations, the solar system - Mars, the Moon,
  the Asteroid Belt - was humanity''s great frontier. Until now. The alien artefact
  working through its program under the clouds of Venus has emerged to build a massive
  structure outside the orbit of Uranus: a gate that leads into a starless dark.<br
  /><br />Jim Holden and the crew of the Rocinante are part of a vast flotilla of
  scientific and military ships going out to examine the artefact. But behind the
  scenes, a complex plot is unfolding, with the destruction of Holden at its core.
  As the emissaries of the human race try to find whether the gate is an opportunity
  or a threat, the greatest danger is the one they brought with them.'
