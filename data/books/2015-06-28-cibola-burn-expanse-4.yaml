description: "<b>The fourth novel in James S.A. Corey\u2019s New York Times bestselling\
  \ Expanse series</b><br /><br />The gates have opened the way to thousands of habitable\
  \ planets, and the land rush has begun. Settlers stream out from humanity's home\
  \ planets in a vast, poorly controlled flood, landing on a new world. Among them,\
  \ the Rocinante, haunted by the vast, posthuman network of the protomolecule as\
  \ they investigate what destroyed the great intergalactic society that built the\
  \ gates and the protomolecule.<br /><br />But Holden and his crew must also contend\
  \ with the growing tensions between the settlers and the company which owns the\
  \ official claim to the planet. Both sides will stop at nothing to defend what's\
  \ theirs, but soon a terrible disease strikes and only Holden - with help from the\
  \ ghostly Detective Miller - can find the cure."

      note: 'Not entirely sure where to put The Vital Abyss. I would have to re-read
        it to be sure, but I think it might end just before Nemesis Games, which would
        make #4.5 the spot for it. I think the #3.5 ordering is based on the time
        period of the main events of the novella, rather than the time period of the
        last events of the novella. However, I''m leaving it at #5.5 for now, since
        the chronology is unclear and reading it before Nemesis Games is a terrible
        idea.'
