description: "<div>The Ghost Brigades are the Special Forces of the Colonial Defense\
  \ Forces, elite troops created from the DNA of the dead and turned into the perfect\
  \ soldiers for the CDF's toughest operations. They're young, they're fast and strong,\
  \ and they're totally without normal human qualms.<br /><br />The universe is a\
  \ dangerous place for humanity--and it's about to become far more dangerous. Three\
  \ races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our expansion into\
  \ space. Their linchpin: the turncoat military scientist Charles Boutin, who knows\
  \ the CDF's biggest military secrets. To prevail, the CDF must find out why Boutin\
  \ did what he did.<br /><br />Jared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers\
  \ -- a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin's DNA, Jared's brain should be able\
  \ to access Boutin's electronic memories. But when the memory transplant appears\
  \ to fail, Jared is given to the Ghost Brigades.<br /><br />At first, Jared is a\
  \ perfect soldier, but as Boutin's memories slowly surface, Jared begins to intuit\
  \ the reason's for Boutin's betrayal. As Jared desperately hunts for his \"father,\"\
  \ he must also come to grips with his own choices. Time is running out: The alliance\
  \ is preparing its offensive, and some of them plan worse things than humanity's\
  \ mere military defeat\u2026<br /></div>"
