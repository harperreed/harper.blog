description: "<i>Before the Internet became widely known as a global tool for terrorists,\
  \ one perceptive U.S. citizen recognized its ominous potential. Armed with clear\
  \ evidence of computer espionage, he began a highly personal quest to expose a hidden\
  \ network of spies that threatened national security. But would the authorities\
  \ back him up? Cliff Stoll's dramatic firsthand account is \"a computer-age detective\
  \ story, instantly fascinating [and] astonishingly gripping\"</i> (Smithsonian).\
  \ <br /><br />Cliff Stoll was an astronomer turned systems manager at Lawrence Berkeley\
  \ Lab when a 75-cent accounting error alerted him to the presence of an unauthorized\
  \ user on his system. The hacker's code name was \"Hunter\"\u2014a mysterious invader\
  \ who managed to break into U.S. computer systems and steal sensitive military and\
  \ security information. Stoll began a one-man hunt of his own: spying on the spy.\
  \ It was a dangerous game of deception, broken codes, satellites, and missile bases\u2014\
  a one-man sting operation that finally gained the attention of the CIA . . . and\
  \ ultimately trapped an international spy ring fueled by cash, cocaine, and the\
  \ KGB."
