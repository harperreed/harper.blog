description: 'Inheriting your uncle''s supervillain business is more complicated than
  you might think. Particularly when you discover who''s running the place.<br /><br
  />Charlie''s life is going nowhere fast. A divorced substitute teacher living with
  his cat in a house his siblings want to sell, all he wants is to open a pub downtown,
  if only the bank will approve his loan.<br /><br />Then his long-lost uncle Jake
  dies and leaves his supervillain business (complete with island volcano lair) to
  Charlie.<br /><br />But becoming a supervillain isn''t all giant laser death rays
  and lava pits. Jake had enemies, and now they''re coming after Charlie. His uncle
  might have been a stand-up, old-fashioned kind of villain, but these are the real
  thing: rich, soulless predators backed by multinational corporations and venture
  capital.<br /><br />It''s up to Charlie to win the war his uncle started against
  a league of supervillains. But with unionized dolphins, hyperintelligent talking
  spy cats, and a terrifying henchperson at his side, going bad is starting to look
  pretty good.<br /><br />In a dog-eat-dog world...be a cat.'
