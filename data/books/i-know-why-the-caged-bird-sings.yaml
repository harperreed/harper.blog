description: "Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother\
  \ in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment\
  \ and the prejudice of the local \"powhitetrash.\" At eight years old and back at\
  \ her mother\u2019s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her\
  \ age\u2014and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in\
  \ San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her\
  \ own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (\"I met and fell in love with\
  \ William Shakespeare\") will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned.<br /><br\
  \ />Poetic and powerful, <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i> will touch hearts\
  \ and change minds for as long as people read."
