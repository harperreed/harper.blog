description: "<i>From the Edge of Apocalypse:</i><br /><br />Deception Well is a world\
  \ on the edge, home to an isolated remnant surviving at the farthest reach of human\
  \ expansion. All across the frontier, other worlds have succumbed to the relentless\
  \ attacks of robotic alien warships, while hundreds of light years away, the core\
  \ of human civilization\u2014those star systems closest to Earth, known as the Hallowed\
  \ Vasties\u2014have all fallen to ruins. Powerful telescopes can see only dust and\
  \ debris where once there were orbital mega-structures so huge they eclipsed the\
  \ light of their parent stars.<br /><br />No one knows for sure what caused the\
  \ Hallowed Vasties to fail, but a hardened adventurer named Urban intends to find\
  \ out. He has the resources to do it. He commands a captive alien starship fully\
  \ capable of facing the dangers that lie beyond Deception Well.<br /><br />With\
  \ a ship\u2019s company of explorers and scientists, Urban is embarking on a voyage\
  \ of re-discovery. They will be the first in centuries to confront the hazards of\
  \ an inverted frontier as they venture back along the path of human migration. Their\
  \ goal: to unravel the mystery of the Hallowed Vasties and to discover what monstrous\
  \ life might have grown up among the ruins.<br /><br /><i>Edges</i> is a new entry\
  \ point into the classic story world of Linda Nagata\u2019s The Nanotech Succession."
