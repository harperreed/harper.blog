description: "Ellinor, en kommunikasjonsr\xE5giver i tredve\xE5rene, kjenner at det\
  \ ikke er nok alvor og inderlighet i tilv\xE6relsen. At livet hennes er for banalt\
  \ for fortvilelsen hun f\xF8ler. Da en kollega forsvinner, m\xE5 hun overta jobben\
  \ fra Postkom som han sto midt oppe i. Ved \xE5 l\xE6re de postansatte om media,\
  \ makt og politikk skal hun bist\xE5 dem i arbeidet mot innf\xF8ringen av EUs tredje\
  \ postdirektiv. Vi f\xF8lger livet hennes gjennom et halv\xE5r fram til Arbeiderpartiets\
  \ landsm\xF8te i april 2011."
