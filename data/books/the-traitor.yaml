description: Cisco (The Tyrant) ups the ante for provocative dark fantasy by giving
  this coming-of-age tale a subtle metaphysical edge. While still a boy, sensitive
  Nophtha realizes that he's uncommonly empathetic and able to see the world from
  the perspective of others. Tutored by his uncle, Nophtha apprentices as an itinerant
  spirit eater, or someone who absorbs lingering ghosts that congest the surrounding
  atmosphere and converts their essence into formidable healing powers. One day, Nophtha
  crosses paths with his alter ego, Wite, a soul burner who hopes to evolve to a higher
  level of being by gorging himself on the souls of the living. Under his sway, Nophtha
  is compelled to evaluate whether he and Wite are that different in nature, and to
  assess his feelings about family and community. Cisco writes in a reflective style
  that masks his narrative's virtual absence of a plot. Though discursive and sometimes
  repetitive, the story still moves toward its conclusion with a momentum borne of
  the author's meditative prose and aphoristic expressions.
