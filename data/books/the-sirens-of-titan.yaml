description: "The Sirens of Titan is an outrageous romp through space, time, and morality.\
  \ The richest, most depraved man on Earth, Malachi Constant, is offered a chance\
  \ to take a space journey to distant worlds with a beautiful woman at his side.\
  \ Of course there's a catch to the invitation\u2014and a prophetic vision about\
  \ the purpose of human life that only Vonnegut has the courage to tell."
