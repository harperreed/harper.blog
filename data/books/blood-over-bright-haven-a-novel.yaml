description: "<b>Magic has made the city of Tiran an industrial utopia, but magic\
  \ has a cost\u2014and the collectors have come calling.</b><br /><br />An orphan\
  \ since the age of four, Sciona has always had more to prove than her fellow students.\
  \ For twenty years, she has devoted every waking moment to the study of magic, fueled\
  \ by a mad desire to achieve the impossible: to be the first woman ever admitted\
  \ to the High Magistry. When she finally claws her way up the ranks to become a\
  \ highmage, however, she finds that her challenges have just begun. Her new colleagues\
  \ will stop at nothing to let her know she is unwelcome, beginning with giving her\
  \ a janitor instead of a qualified lab assistant.<br /><br />What neither Sciona\
  \ nor her peers realize is that her taciturn assistant was once more than a janitor;\
  \ before he mopped floors for the mages, Thomil was a nomadic hunter from beyond\
  \ Tiran\u2019s magical barrier. Ten years have passed since he survived the perilous\
  \ crossing that killed his family. But working for a highmage, he sees the opportunity\
  \ to finally understand the forces that decimated his tribe, drove him from his\
  \ homeland, and keep the Tiranish in power.<br /><br />Through their fractious relationship,\
  \ mage and outsider uncover an ancient secret that could change the course of magic\
  \ forever\u2014if it doesn\u2019t get them killed first. Sciona has defined her\
  \ life by the pursuit of truth, but how much is one truth worth with the fate of\
  \ civilization in the balance?<br /><br /><b>A standalone dark academia brimming\
  \ with mystery, tragedy, and the damning echoes of the past. For fans of Leigh Bardugo,\
  \ V. E. Schwab, and Fullmetal Alchemist.</b><br /><br />(Content warnings for gore,\
  \ sexual assault, and suicidal ideation)"
