description: "In <i>Breakfast of Champions,</i> one of Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s\_ most\
  \ beloved characters, the aging writer Kilgore Trout, finds to his horror that a\
  \ Midwest car dealer is taking his fiction as truth. What follows is murderously\
  \ funny satire, as Vonnegut looks at war, sex, racism, success, politics, and pollution\
  \ in America and reminds us how to see the truth."
