description: "<b><i>To Sleep in a Sea of Stars</i> is a brand new epic novel from\
  \ #1 New York Times bestselling author of <i>Eragon</i>, Christopher Paolini.</b><br\
  \ /><br /><b>Kira Nav\xE1rez dreamed of life on new worlds.<br /><br />Now she's\
  \ awakened a nightmare.</b><br /><br />During a routine survey mission on an uncolonized\
  \ planet, Kira finds an alien relic. At first she's delighted, but elation turns\
  \ to terror when the ancient dust around her begins to move.<br /><br />As war erupts\
  \ among the stars, Kira is launched into a galaxy-spanning odyssey of discovery\
  \ and transformation. First contact isn't at all what she imagined, and events push\
  \ her to the very limits of what it means to be human.<br /><br />While Kira faces\
  \ her own horrors, Earth and its colonies stand upon the brink of annihilation.\
  \ Now, Kira might be humanity's greatest and final hope . . ."
