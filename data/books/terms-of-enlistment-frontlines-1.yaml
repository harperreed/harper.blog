description: "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at\
  \ the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of\
  \ the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two\
  \ thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<br /><br />You can hope to\
  \ win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you\
  \ can join the service.<br /><br />With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew\
  \ chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus,\
  \ and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege,\
  \ he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price\u2026\
  and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats\
  \ or the gangs that rule the slums.<br /><br />The debut novel from Marko Kloos,\
  \ <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition\
  \ of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."
