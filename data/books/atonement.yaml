description: "Ian McEwan\u2019s symphonic novel of love and war, childhood and class,\
  \ guilt and forgiveness provides all the satisfaction of a brilliant narrative and\
  \ the provocation we have come to expect from this master of English prose.<br /><br\
  \ />On a hot summer day in 1935, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis witnesses the flirtation\
  \ between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie Turner, the son of a servant. But\
  \ Briony\u2019s incomplete grasp of adult motives and her precocious imagination\
  \ bring about a crime that will change all their lives, a crime whose repercussions\
  \ Atonement follows through the chaos and carnage of World War II and into the close\
  \ of the twentieth century.<br /><br />(back cover)"
