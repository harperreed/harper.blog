description: "<p>\n  <strong>Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2020 by Apple Books,\
  \ <em>Literary Hub</em>, <em>The Millions</em>, and <em>The Week</em><br /><br /><br\
  \ /><br />An indelible novel of teenage alienation and adult complacency in an unraveling\
  \ world.</strong>\n</p><br /><p>Pulitzer Prize finalist Lydia Millet\u2019s sublime\
  \ new novel\u2014her first since the National Book Award long-listed <em>Sweet Lamb\
  \ of Heaven</em>\u2014follows a group of twelve eerily mature children on a forced\
  \ vacation with their families at a sprawling lakeside mansion.</p><br /><p>Contemptuous\
  \ of their parents, who pass their days in a stupor of liquor, drugs, and sex, the\
  \ children feel neglected and suffocated at the same time. When a destructive storm\
  \ descends on the summer estate, the group\u2019s ringleaders\u2014including Eve,\
  \ who narrates the story\u2014decide to run away, leading the younger ones on a\
  \ dangerous foray into the apocalyptic chaos outside.</p><br /><p>As the scenes\
  \ of devastation begin to mimic events in the dog-eared picture Bible carried around\
  \ by her beloved little brother, Eve devotes herself to keeping him safe from harm.</p><br\
  \ /><p><em>A Children\u2019s Bible</em> is a prophetic, heartbreaking story of generational\
  \ divide\u2014and a haunting vision of what awaits us on the far side of Revelation.</p>"
