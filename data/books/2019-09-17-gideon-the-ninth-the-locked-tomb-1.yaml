description: The Emperor needs necromancers.<br /><br />The Ninth Necromancer needs
  a swordswoman.<br /><br />Gideon has a sword, some dirty magazines, and no more
  time for undead bullshit.<br /><br />Brought up by unfriendly, ossifying nuns, ancient
  retainers, and countless skeletons, Gideon is ready to abandon a life of servitude
  and an afterlife as a reanimated corpse. She packs up her sword, her shoes, and
  her dirty magazines, and prepares to launch her daring escape. But her childhood
  nemesis won't set her free without a service.<br /><br />Harrowhark Nonagesimus,
  Reverend Daughter of the Ninth House and bone witch extraordinaire, has been summoned
  into action. The Emperor has invited the heirs to each of his loyal Houses to a
  deadly trial of wits and skill. If Harrowhark succeeds she will become an immortal,
  all-powerful servant of the Resurrection, but no necromancer can ascend without
  their cavalier. Without Gideon's sword, Harrow will fail, and the Ninth House will
  die.<br /><br />Of course, some things are better left dead.

      description: "The Locked Tomb Series, by Tamsyn Muir, follows the dread adventures\
        \ of Gideon Nav, Harrowhark Nonagesimus, and a host of other goths. These\
        \ epic science fantasy novels mix funny tone with dark subject matter, and\
        \ contain swashbuckling action, waves of bones, and lesbian necromancers in\
        \ space. The series has earned enormous critical praise and rabid reader engagement,\
        \ with the USA Today Best Selling first novel Gideon the Ninth receiving an\
        \ amazing five starred reviews.\n    \n    \u201CUnlike anything I\u2019ve\
        \ ever read. Muir\u2019s writing is as sharp as a broken tooth, and just as\
        \ unsettling. This book is visceral, vivid, and downright violent. In short,\
        \ absolutely marvelous.\u201D \u2014V.E. Schwab, #1 New York Times Bestselling\
