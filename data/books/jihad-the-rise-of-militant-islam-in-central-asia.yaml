description: "The terrorist attacks of September 11 have turned the world\u2019s attention\
  \ to areas of the globe about which we know very little. Ahmed Rashid, who masterfully\
  \ explained Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban regime in his previous book, here turns his\
  \ skills as an investigative journalist to the five Central Asian republics adjacent\
  \ to Afghanistan. Central Asia is coming to play a vital strategic role in the war\
  \ on terrorism, but the region also poses new threats to global security. <br /><br\
  \ />The five Central Asian republics\u2014Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,\
  \ Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan\u2014were part of the Soviet Union until its collapse\
  \ in 1991. Under Soviet rule, Islam was brutally suppressed, and that intolerance\
  \ has continued under the post-Soviet regimes. Religious repression, political corruption,\
  \ and the region\u2019s extreme poverty (unemployment rates exceed 80 percent in\
  \ some areas) have created a fertile climate for militant Islamic fundamentalism.\
  \ Often funded and trained by such organizations as Osama bin Laden\u2019s Al Qaeda\
  \ and the Taliban, guerrilla movements like the IMU (Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan)\
  \ have recruited a staggering number of members across the region and threaten to\
  \ topple the governments of all five nations. Based on groundbreaking research and\
  \ numerous interviews, <i>Jihad </i>explains<i> </i>the roots of militant rage in\
  \ Central Asia, describes the goals and activities of these militant organizations,\
  \ and suggests ways in which this threat could be neutralized by diplomatic and\
  \ economic intervention.<br /><br />Rich in both cultural heritage and natural resources\u2014\
  including massive oil reservoirs\u2014Central Asia remains desperately poor and\
  \ frighteningly volatile. In tracing the history of Central Asia and explaining\
  \ the current political climate, Rashid demonstrates that it is a region we ignore\
  \ at our peril."
