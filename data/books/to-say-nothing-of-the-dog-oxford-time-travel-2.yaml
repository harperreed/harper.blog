description: From Connie Willis, winner of multiple Hugo and Nebula Awards, comes
  a comedic romp through an unpredictable world of mystery, love, and time travel...<br
  /><br />Ned Henry is badly in need of a rest. He's been shuttling between the 21st
  century and the 1940s searching for a Victorian atrocity called the bishop's bird
  stump. It's part of a project to restore the famed Coventry Cathedral, destroyed
  in a Nazi air raid over a hundred years earlier. <br /><br />But then Verity Kindle,
  a fellow time traveler, inadvertently brings back something from the past. Now Ned
  must jump back to the Victorian era to help Verity put things right--not only to
  save the project but to prevent altering history itself.
