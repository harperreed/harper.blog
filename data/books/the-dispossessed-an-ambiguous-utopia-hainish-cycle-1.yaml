description: Centuries ago, the moon Anarres was settled by utopian anarchists who
  left the Earthlike planet Urras in search of a better world, a new beginning. Now
  a brilliant physicist, Shevek, determines to reunite the two civilizations that
  have been separated by hatred since long before he was born.<br /><br /><i>The Dispossessed</i>
  is a penetrating examination of society and humanity -- and one man's brave undertaking
  to question the unquestionable and ignite the fires of change.
