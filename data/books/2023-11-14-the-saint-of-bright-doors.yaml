description: "<b>\n  <i>The Saint of Bright Doors</i>\n</b> <b>sets the high drama\
  \ of divine revolutionaries and transcendent cults against the mundane struggles\
  \ of modern life, resulting in</b> <b>a novel that is revelatory and resonant.</b><br\
  \ /><br />Fetter was raised to kill, honed as a knife to cut down his sainted father.\
  \ This gave him plenty to talk about in therapy. <br /><br />He walked among invisible\
  \ devils and anti-gods that mock the mortal form. He learned a lethal catechism,\
  \ lost his shadow, and gained a habit for secrecy. After a blood-soaked childhood,\
  \ Fetter escaped his rural hometown for the big city, and fell into a broader world\
  \ where divine destinies are a dime a dozen.<br /><br />Everything in Luriat is\
  \ more than it seems. Group therapy is recruitment for a revolutionary cadre. Junk\
  \ email hints at the arrival of a god. Every door is laden with potential, and once\
  \ closed may never open again. The city is scattered with Bright Doors, looming\
  \ portals through which a cold wind blows. In this unknowable metropolis, Fetter\
  \ will discover what kind of man he is, and his discovery will rewrite the world.<br\
