description: "<b>A crew must try to survive on an ancient, abandoned planet in the\
  \ latest space horror novel from S.A. Barnes, acclaimed author of <i>Dead Silence</i>.</b><br\
  \ /><br />Space exploration can be lonely and isolating.<br /><br />Psychologist\
  \ Dr. Ophelia Bray has dedicated her life to the study and prevention of ERS\u2014\
  a space-based condition most famous for a case that resulted in the brutal murders\
  \ of twenty-nine people. When she's assigned to a small exploration crew, she's\
  \ eager to make a difference. But as they begin to establish residency on an abandoned\
  \ planet, it becomes clear that crew is hiding something.<br /><br />While Ophelia\
  \ focuses on her new role, her crewmates are far more interested in investigating\
  \ the eerie, ancient planet and unraveling the mystery behind the previous colonizer's\
  \ hasty departure than opening up to her.<br /><br />That is, until their pilot\
  \ is discovered gruesomely murdered. Is this Ophelia\u2019s worst nightmare starting\u2014\
  a wave of violence and mental deterioration from ERS? Or is it something more sinister?<br\
  \ /><br />Terrified that history will repeat itself, Ophelia and the crew must work\
  \ together to figure out what\u2019s happening. But trust is hard to come by\u2026\
  \ and the crew isn\u2019t the only one keeping secrets."
