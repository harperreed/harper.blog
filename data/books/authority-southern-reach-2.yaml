description: "<p>\n  <b>In the second volume of the Southern Reach Trilogy, questions\
  \ are answered, stakes are raised, and mysteries are\_deepened . . .<br /></b>\n\
  \  <br /></p><p>In <i>Annihilation</i>,<i> </i>Jeff VanderMeer introduced\_Area\
  \ X\u2014a remote and lush terrain mysteriously sequestered from civilization.\_\
  This was the first volume of a projected trilogy; well in advance of publication,\
  \ translation rights had already\_sold around the world and a major movie deal had\
  \ been struck.<br />\_\_\_\_ Just months later, <i>Authority</i>, the second volume,\
  \ is here. For thirty years, the only human engagement with Area X has taken the\
  \ form of a series of expeditions monitored by a secret agency called the Southern\
  \ Reach. After the disastrous twelfth expedition chronicled in <i>Annihilation</i>,<i>\
  \ </i>the Southern Reach is in disarray, and John Rodriguez, aka \u201CControl,\u201D\
  \ is the team\u2019s newly appointed head. From a series of interrogations, a cache\
  \ of hidden notes, and hours of profoundly troubling video footage, the secrets\
  \ of Area X begin to reveal themselves\u2014and what they expose pushes Control\
  \ to confront disturbing truths about both himself and the agency he\u2019s promised\
  \ to serve. And the consequences will\_spread much further than that.<br />\_\_\_\
  \_ The Southern Reach trilogy will conclude in fall 2014 with <i>Acceptance</i>.<br\
  \ /></p>"
