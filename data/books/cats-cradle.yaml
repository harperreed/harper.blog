description: <i>Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11828537-cat-s-cradle"
  rel="nofollow">here</a></i><br /><br /><b>Cat's Cradle</b>, one of Vonnegut's most
  entertaining novels, is filled with scientists and G-men and even ordinary folks
  caught up in the game. These assorted characters chase each other around in search
  of the world's most important and dangerous substance, a new form of ice that freezes
  at room temperature. At one time, this novel could probably be found on the bookshelf
  of every college kid in America; it's still a fabulous read and a great place to
  start if you're young enough to have missed the first Vonnegut craze.
