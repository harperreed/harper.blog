description: '<b>A candid, colorful, and comprehensive oral history that reveals the
  secrets of Silicon Valley -- from the origins of Apple and Atari to the present
  day clashes of Google and Facebook, and all the start-ups and disruptions that happened
  along the way.</b><br />Rarely has one economy asserted itself as swiftly--and as
  aggressively--as the entity we now know as Silicon Valley. Built with a seemingly
  permanent culture of reinvention, Silicon Valley does not fight change; it embraces
  it, and now powers the American economy and global innovation.<br /><br /> So how
  did this omnipotent and ever-morphing place come to be? It was not by planning.
  It was, like many an empire before it, part luck, part timing, and part ambition.
  And part pure, unbridled genius...<br /><br />Drawing on over two hundred in-depth
  interviews, VALLEY OF GENIUS takes readers from the dawn of the personal computer
  and the internet, through the heyday of the web, up to the very moment when our
  current technological reality was invented. The book interweaves stories of invention
  and betrayal, overnight success and underground exploits, to tell the story of Silicon
  Valley like it has never been told before. These are the stories that Valley insiders
  tell each other: the tall tales that are all, improbably, true.'
