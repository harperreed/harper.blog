description: The Alliance has been fighting the Syndics for a century--and losing
  badly. Now its fleet is crippled and stranded in enemy territory. Their only hope
  is a man who's emerged from a century-long hibernation to find he has been heroically
  idealized, beyond belief...<br /><br />Captain John "Black Jack" Geary's legendary
  exploits are known to every schoolchild. Revered for his heroic "last stand" in
  the early days of the war, he was presumed dead. But a century later, Geary miraculously
  returns from survival hibernation and reluctantly takes command of the Alliance
  fleet as it faces annihilation by the Syndics.<br /><br />Appalled by the hero-worship
  around him, Geary is nevertheless a man who will do his duty. And he knows that
  bringing the stolen Syndic hypernet key safely home is the Alliance's one chance
  to win the war. But to do that, Geary will have to live up to the impossibly heroic
  "Black Jack" legend...
