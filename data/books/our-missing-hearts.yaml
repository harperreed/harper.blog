description: "<b>From the #1 bestselling author of<i>Little Fires Everywhere</i>,\
  \ comes one of the most highly anticipated books of the year \u2013 the inspiring\
  \ new novel about a mother\u2019s unbreakable love in a world consumed by fear.</b><br\
  \ /><br />Twelve-year-old Bird Gardner lives a quiet existence with his loving but\
  \ broken father, a former linguist who now shelves books in a university library.\
  \ Bird knows to not ask too many questions, stand out too much, or stray too far.\
  \ For a decade, their lives have been governed by laws written to preserve \u201C\
  American culture\u201D in the wake of years of economic instability and violence.\
  \ To keep the peace and restore prosperity, the authorities are now allowed to relocate\
  \ children of dissidents, especially those of Asian origin, and libraries have been\
  \ forced to remove books seen as unpatriotic\u2014including the work of Bird\u2019\
  s mother, Margaret, a Chinese American poet who left the family when he was nine\
  \ years old.<br /> <br />Bird has grown up disavowing his mother and her poems;\
  \ he doesn\u2019t know her work or what happened to her, and he knows he shouldn\u2019\
  t wonder. But when he receives a mysterious letter containing only a cryptic drawing,\
  \ he is pulled into a quest to find her. His journey will take him back to the many\
  \ folktales she poured into his head as a child, through the ranks of an underground\
  \ network of librarians, into the lives of the children who have been taken, and\
  \ finally to New York City, where a new act of defiance may be the beginning of\
  \ much-needed change.<br /> <br /><i>Our Missing Hearts</i> is an old story made\
  \ new, of the ways supposedly civilized communities can ignore the most searing\
  \ injustice. It\u2019s a story about the power\u2014and limitations\u2014of art\
  \ to create change, the lessons and legacies we pass on to our children, and how\
  \ any of us can survive a broken world with our hearts intact."
