description: 'A millennium into the future two advancements have altered the course
  of human history: the colonization of the galaxy and the creation of the positronic
  brain. Isaac Asimov''s "Robot" novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between
  a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together.
  <br /><br />Like most people left behind on an over-populated Earth, New York City
  police detective Elijah Baley had little love for either the arrogant Spacers or
  their robotic companions. But when a prominent Spacer is murdered under mysterious
  circumstances, Baley is ordered to the Outer Worlds to help track down the killer.
  <br /><br />The relationship between Lije and his Spacer superiors, who distrusted
  all Earthmen, was strained from the start. Then he learned that they had assigned
  him a partner: R. Daneel Olivaw. Worst of all was that the "R" stood for robot--and
  his positronic partner was made in the image and likeness of the murder victim!'

        >Foundation Universe</a>\n    \n    This series of short stories and novels\
        \ featuring positronic robots are set in the first age of positronic robotics\
        \ and space exploration.\n    \n    The unique feature of Asimov's robots\
        \ are the Three Laws of Robotics, hardwired in a robot's positronic brain,\
        \ which all robots in his fiction must obey, and which ensure that the robot\
        \ does not turn against its creators."
      id: '49175'
      note: "According to Asimov, The Complete Robot was the first book in the series,\
        \ although it did include all the stories in the earlier I, Robot and The\
        \ Rest of the Robots. \n    Therefore the earlier collections might be considered\
        \ precursors for the entire series.\n    \n    The remaining short story collections\
        \ and The Positronic Man chronologically fall between The Complete Robot and\
        \ the The Caves of Steel.\n    One could also argue that the Tiedemann/Irvine\
        \ Robot Mystery series as well as Allen's Caliban series belong in the series."
