description: '"A deft, ironic, beautiful novel that deserves to be a classic." - William
  Styron<br /><br />From the moment of its publication in 1961, <i>Revolutionary Road</i>
  was hailed as a masterpiece of realistic fiction and as the most evocative portrayal
  of the opulent desolation of the American suburbs. It''s the story of Frank and
  April Wheeler, a bright, beautiful, and talented couple who have lived on the assumption
  that greatness is only just around the corner. With heartbreaking compassion and
  remorseless clarity, Richard Yates shows how Frank and April mortgage their spiritual
  birthright, betraying not only each other, but their best selves.<br /><br />In
  his introduction to this edition, novelist Richard Ford pays homage to the lasting
  influence and enduring power of <i>Revolutionary Road</i>.'
