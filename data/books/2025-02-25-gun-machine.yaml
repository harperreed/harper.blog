description: <b>Warren Ellis reimagines New York City as a puzzle with the most dangerous
  pieces of guns.</b> After a shootout claims the life of his partner in a condemned
  tenement building on Pearl Street, Detective John Tallow unwittingly stumbles across
  an apartment stacked high with guns. When examined, each weapon leads to a different,
  previously unsolved murder. Someone has been killing people for twenty years or
  more and storing the weapons together for some inexplicable purpose. Confronted
  with the sudden emergence of hundreds of unsolved homicides, Tallow soon discovers
  that he's walked into a veritable deal with the devil. An unholy bargain that has
  made possible the rise of some of Manhattan's most prominent captains of industry.
  A hunter who performs his deadly acts as a sacrifice to the old gods of Manhattan,
  who may, quite simply, be the most prolific murderer in New York City's history.
  Warren Ellis's body of work has been championed by Wired for its "merciless action"
  and "incorruptible bravery," and steadily amassed legions of diehard fans. His newest
  novel builds on his accomplishments like never before, announcing Ellis as one of
  today's most daring thriller writers. This is twenty-first century suspense writ
  large. This is Gun Machine.
