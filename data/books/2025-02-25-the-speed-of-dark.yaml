  \ Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap\

  \ adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and\
  \ a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives\
  \ a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact.\
  \ He has taught himself to use \u201Cplease\u201D and \u201Cthank you\u201D and\
  \ other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable.\
  \ He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself.\

  \ Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to\
