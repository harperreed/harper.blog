description: "Shrouding themselves and their aims in deepest secrecy, the leaders\
  \ of the Taliban movement control Afghanistan with an inflexible, crushing fundamentalism.\
  \ The most extreme and radical of all Islamic organizations, the Taliban inspires\
  \ fascination, controversy, and especially fear in both the Muslim world and the\
  \ West. Correspondent Ahmed Rashid brings the shadowy world of the Taliban into\
  \ sharp focus in this enormously interesting and revealing book. It is the only\
  \ authoritative account of the Taliban and modern day Afghanistan available to English\
  \ language readers.<br /><p><br />Based on his experiences as a journalist covering\
  \ the civil war in Afghanistan for twenty years, traveling and living with the Taliban,\
  \ and interviewing most of the Taliban leaders since their emergence to power in\
  \ 1994, Rashid offers unparalleled firsthand information. He explains how the growth\
  \ of Taliban power has already created severe instability in Russia, Iran, Pakistan,\
  \ and five Central Asian republics. He describes the Taliban' s role as a major\
  \ player in a new \"Great Game\"\x97a competition among Western countries and companies\
  \ to build oil and gas pipelines from Central Asia to Western and Asian markets.\
  \ The author also discusses the controversial changes in American attitudes toward\
  \ the Taliban\x97from early support to recent bombings of Osama Bin Laden's hideaway\
  \ and other Taliban-protected terrorist bases\x97and how they have influenced the\
  \ stability of the region.</p>"
