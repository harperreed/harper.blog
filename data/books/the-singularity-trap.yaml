description: "After scrimping and saving for two years, Ivan Pritchard lands a berth\
  \ with the mining ship Mad Astra. His one share buys him six months of searching\
  \ the asteroid belt for that elusive cache of metals that could make the entire\
  \ crew wealthy, and allow Ivan to pull his family out of the depths of poverty.<br\
  \ /><br />While investigating a promising asteroid, Ivan triggers an extraterrestrial\
  \ booby trap, which squirts a strange liquid substance onto his arm. The next morning,\
  \ he wakes up to find his forearm turning into living metal. Soon his other limbs\
  \ begin to change, and worse yet, there\u2019s an artificial intelligence growing\
  \ in his head and talking to him. As alien nanites eat his ship out from under him,\
  \ the AI reveals its mission: to convert the solar system and the human race into\
  \ a war machine meant to fight in an interstellar battle that has raged for millions\
  \ of years.<br /><br />To save his family\u2014and the human race\u2014Ivan will\
  \ need to play a deadly game of brinkmanship with the military, all the while hiding\
  \ his plans from both his crewmates and the alien computer residing in his brain."
