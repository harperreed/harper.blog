description: "<p>The #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Seveneves,\
  \ Anathem, Reamde</em>, and <em>Cryptonomicon</em> returns with a wildly inventive\
  \ and entertaining science fiction thriller\u2014<em>Paradise Lost</em> by way of\
  \ Phillip K. Dick\u2014that unfolds in the near future, in parallel worlds.<br /><br\
  \ />In his youth, Richard \u201CDodge\u201D Forthrast founded Corporation 9592,\
  \ a gaming company that made him a multibillionaire. Now in his middle years, Dodge\
  \ appreciates his comfortable, unencumbered life, managing his myriad business interests,\
  \ and spending time with his beloved niece Zula and her young daughter, Sophia.\
  \ </p><p>One beautiful autumn day, while he undergoes a routine medical procedure,\
  \ something goes irrevocably wrong. Dodge is pronounced brain dead and put on life\
  \ support, leaving his stunned family and close friends with difficult decisions.\
  \ Long ago, when a much younger Dodge drew up his will, he directed that his body\
  \ be given to a cryonics company now owned by enigmatic tech entrepreneur Elmo Shepherd.\
  \ Legally bound to follow the directive despite their misgivings, Dodge\u2019s family\
  \ has his brain scanned and its data structures uploaded and stored in the cloud,\
  \ until it can eventually be revived. </p><p>In the coming years, technology allows\
  \ Dodge\u2019s brain to be turned back on. It is an achievement that is nothing\
  \ less than the disruption of death itself. An eternal afterlife\u2014the Bitworld\u2014\
  is created, in which humans continue to exist as digital souls. </p><p>But this\
  \ brave new immortal world is not the Utopia it might first seem . . . </p><p><em>Fall,\
  \ or Dodge in Hell</em> is pure, unadulterated fun: a grand drama of analog and\
  \ digital, man and machine, angels and demons, gods and followers, the finite and\
  \ the eternal. In this exhilarating epic, Neal Stephenson raises profound existential\
  \ questions and touches on the revolutionary breakthroughs that are transforming\
  \ our future. Combining the technological, philosophical, and spiritual in one grand\
  \ myth, he delivers a mind-blowing speculative literary saga for the modern age.</p>"
