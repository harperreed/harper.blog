description: "<blockquote>\n  <b>An international spy thriller of the highest order\
  \ that traverses from Venice to London to Washington, D.C.</b>\n</blockquote>Micah\
  \ Dalton is not paid to ask questions. He's the man the CIA sends to clean up the\
  \ mess when something goes wrong-an agent gets in trouble, or worse. But when his\
  \ colleague and friend Porter Nauman turns up dead in an idyllic Tuscan hill town,\
  \ as a result of an apparent and unimaginably gruesome suicide, Dalton can't help\
  \ but ask questions. And when Nauman's family is subsequently slaughtered back home\
  \ in London, Dalton can sit back no longer.<p>Moving from Venice to London to Washington,\
  \ D.C., to the unbearably beautiful mountains of the American West, Dalton tracks\
  \ the specter who, with a penchant for intricate knifework influenced by Native\
  \ American mysticism, is killing a disparate group of agents, former agents, and\
  \ contract men-all of whom seem to have a connection to ECHELON, a mysterious company\
  \ operation. The murders appear to be acts of retribution, but for what?</p><p>Elegant,\
  \ horrifying, and chillingly suspenseful, <i>The Echelon Vendetta</i> will keep\
  \ you enthralled, through its final, supremely satisfying twist.</p>"
