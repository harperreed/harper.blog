description: "<div>\n  <p><i>Time Salvager:\_</i>a fast-paced time travel adventure\
  \ from Wesley Chu, the award-winning author of of <i>The Lives of Tao.</i></p>\n\
  \  <p>In a future when Earth is a toxic, abandoned world and humanity has spread\
  \ into the outer solar system to survive, the tightly controlled use of time travel\
  \ holds the key maintaining a fragile existence among the other planets and their\
  \ moons. James Griffin-Mars is a chronman--a convicted criminal recruited for his\
  \ unique psychological makeup to undertake the most dangerous job there is: missions\
  \ into Earth's past to recover resources and treasure without altering the timeline.\_\
  Most chronmen\_never\_reach old age, and\_James is reaching his breaking point.\
  \ <br /><br />On a final mission that is to secure his retirement, James meets an\
  \ intriguing woman from a previous century, scientist Elise Kim, who is fated to\
  \ die during the destruction of an oceanic rig. Against his training and his common\
  \ sense, James brings her back to the future with him, saving her life, but turning\
  \ them both into fugitives. Remaining free means losing themselves in the wild and\
  \ poisonous wastes of Earth, and discovering what hope may yet remain for humanity's\
  \ home world.</p>\n</div>"
