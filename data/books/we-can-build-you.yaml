description: Louis Rosen and his partners sell people--ingeniously designed, historically
  authentic simulacra of personages such as Edwin M. Stanton and Abraham Lincoln.
  The problem is that the only prospective buyer is a rapacious billionaire whose
  plans for the simulacra could land Louis in jail. Then there's the added complication
  that someone--or something--like Abraham Lincoln may not want to be sold.<br /><br
  />Is an electronic Lincoln any less alive than his creators? Is a machine that cares
  and suffers inferior to the woman Louis loves--a borderline psychopath who does
  neither? With irresistible momentum, intelligence, and wit, Philip K. Dick creates
  an arresting techno-thriller that suggests a marriage of <i>Bladerunner</i> and
  <i>Barbarians at the Gate</i>.
