description: Mariam is only fifteen when she is sent to Kabul to marry the troubled
  and bitter Rasheed, who is thirty years her senior. Nearly two decades later, in
  a climate of growing unrest, tragedy strikes fifteen-year-old Laila, who must leave
  her home and join Mariam's unhappy household. Laila and Mariam are to find consolation
  in each other, their friendship to grow as deep as the bond between sisters, as
  strong as the ties between mother and daughter. <br /><br />With the passing of
  time comes Taliban rule over Afghanistan, the streets of Kabul loud with the sound
  of gunfire and bombs, life a desperate struggle against starvation, brutality and
  fear, the women's endurance tested beyond their worst imaginings. Yet love can move
  people to act in unexpected ways, lead them to overcome the most daunting obstacles
  with a startling heroism. In the end it is love that triumphs over death and destruction.
  <br /><br /><i>A Thousand Splendid Suns</i> is a portrait of a wounded country and
  a story of family and friendship, of an unforgiving time, an unlikely bond, and
  an indestructible love.
