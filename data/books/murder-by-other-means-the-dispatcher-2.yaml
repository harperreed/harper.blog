description: "Welcome to the new world, in which murder is all but a thing of the\
  \ past. Because when someone kills you, 999 times out of 1,000, you instantly come\
  \ back to life. In this world, there are dispatchers\u2014licensed killers who step\
  \ in when you\u2019re at risk of a natural or unintentional death. They kill you\u2014\
  so you can live.<br /><br />Tony Valdez is used to working his job as a dispatcher\
  \ within the rules of the law and the state. But times are tough, and more and more\
  \ Tony finds himself riding the line between what\u2019s legal and what will pay\
  \ his bills. After one of these shady gigs and after being a witness to a crime\
  \ gone horribly wrong, Tony discovers that people around him are dying, for reasons\
  \ that make no sense...and which just may implicate him.<br /><br />Tony is out\
  \ of time: to solve the mystery of these deaths, to keep others from dying, and\
  \ to keep himself from being a victim of what looks like murder, by other means."
