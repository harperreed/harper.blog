description: "<b>Award-winning author Ken Liu presents a new anthology of Chinese\
  \ short speculative fiction.</b><br /><br />Some of the included authors are already\
  \ familiar to readers in the West (Liu Cixin and Hao Jingfang, both Hugo winners);\
  \ some are publishing in English for the first time. Because of the growing interest\
  \ in newer SFF from China, virtually every story here was first published in Chinese\
  \ in the 2010s. The stories span the range from short-shorts to novellas, and evoke\
  \ every hue on the emotional spectrum. Besides stories firmly entrenched in subgenres\
  \ familiar to Western SFF readers such as hard SF, cyberpunk, science fantasy, and\
  \ space opera, the anthology also includes stories that showcase deeper ties to\
  \ Chinese culture: alternate Chinese history, <i>chuanyue</i> time travel, satire\
  \ with historical and contemporary allusions that are likely unknown to the average\
  \ Western reader. While the anthology makes no claim or attempt to be \"representative\"\
  \ or \u201Ccomprehensive,\" it demonstrates the vibrancy and diversity of science\
  \ fiction being written in China at this moment.<br /><br />In addition, three essays\
  \ at the end of the book explore the history of Chinese science fiction publishing,\
  \ the state of contemporary Chinese fandom, and how the growing interest in science\
  \ fiction in China has impacted writers who had long labored in obscurity.<br /><br\
  \ /><b>Stories included:</b><br />\u201CGoodnight, Melancholy\u201D by Xia Jia <br\
  \ />\u201CThe Snow of Jinyang\u201D by Zhang Ran <br />\u201CBroken Stars\u201D\
