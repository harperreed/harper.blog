description: "<b>The Laundry Files\u2019 \u201Cfast-paced blend of espionage thrills,\
  \ mundane office comedy and Lovecraftian horror\u201D (<i>SFX</i>) continues as\
  \ Hugo Award-winning author Charles Stross assigns a day trader to a permanent position\
  \ on the night shift...</b><br /><br />After stumbling upon the algorithm that turned\
  \ him and his fellow merchant bankers into vampires, Alex Schwartz was drafted by\
  \ The Laundry, Britain\u2019s secret counter-occult agency that\u2019s humanity\u2019\
  s first line of defense against the forces of darkness. Dependent on his new employers\
  \ for his continued existence\u2014as Alex has no stomach for predatory bloodsucking\u2014\
  he has little choice but to accept his new role as an operative-in-training.\_<br\
  \ /><br />Dispatched to Leeds, Alex\u2019s first assignment is to help assess the\
  \ costs of renovating a 1950s Cold War bunker into The Laundry\u2019s new headquarters.\
  \ Unfortunately, Leeds is Alex\u2019s hometown, and the thought of breaking the\
  \ news to his parents that he\u2019s left banking for civil service, while hiding\
  \ his undead condition, is causing more anxiety than learning how to live as a vampire\
  \ secret agent preparing to confront multiple apocalypses.<br /><br />Alex\u2019\
  s only saving grace is Cassie Brewer, a drama student appearing in the local Goth\
  \ Festival who is inexplicably attracted to him despite his awkward personality\
  \ and massive amounts of sunblock.\_<br /><br />But Cassie has secrets of her own\u2014\
  secrets that make Alex\u2019s night life behaviors seem positively normal..."
