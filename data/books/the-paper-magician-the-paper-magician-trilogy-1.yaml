description: "Ceony Twill arrives at the cottage of Magician Emery Thane with a broken\
  \ heart. Having graduated at the top of her class from the Tagis Praff School for\
  \ the Magically Inclined, Ceony is assigned an apprenticeship in paper magic despite\
  \ her dreams of bespelling metal. And once she\u2019s bonded to paper, that will\
  \ be her only magic\u2026forever.<br /><br />Yet the spells Ceony learns under the\
  \ strange yet kind Thane turn out to be more marvelous than she could have ever\
  \ imagined\u2014animating paper creatures, bringing stories to life via ghostly\
  \ images, even reading fortunes. But as she discovers these wonders, Ceony also\
  \ learns of the extraordinary dangers of forbidden magic.<br /><br />An Excisioner\u2014\
  a practitioner of dark, flesh magic\u2014invades the cottage and rips Thane\u2019\
  s heart from his chest. To save her teacher\u2019s life, Ceony must face the evil\
  \ magician and embark on an unbelievable adventure that will take her into the chambers\
  \ of Thane\u2019s still-beating heart\u2014and reveal the very soul of the man.<br\
  \ /><br />From the imaginative mind of debut author Charlie N. Holmberg, <i>The\
  \ Paper Magician</i> is an extraordinary adventure both dark and whimsical that\
  \ will delight readers of all ages."
