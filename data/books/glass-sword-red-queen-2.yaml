description: "<i>If there\u2019s one thing Mare Barrow knows, it\u2019s that she\u2019\
  s different.</i><br /><br />Mare Barrow\u2019s blood is red\u2014the color of common\
  \ folk\u2014but her Silver ability, the power to control lightning, has turned her\
  \ into a weapon that the royal court tries to control. <br /><br />The crown calls\
  \ her an impossibility, a fake, but as she makes her escape from Maven, the prince\u2014\
  the friend\u2014who betrayed her, Mare uncovers something startling: she is not\
  \ the only one of her kind.<br /><br />Pursued by Maven, now a vindictive king,\
  \ Mare sets out to find and recruit other Red-and-Silver fighters to join in the\
  \ struggle against her oppressors. <br /><br />But Mare finds herself on a deadly\
  \ path, at risk of becoming exactly the kind of monster she is trying to defeat.\
  \ <br /><br />Will she shatter under the weight of the lives that are the cost of\
  \ rebellion? Or have treachery and betrayal hardened her forever?<br /><br />The\
  \ electrifying next installment in the Red Queen series escalates the struggle between\
  \ the growing rebel army and the blood-segregated world they\u2019ve always known\u2014\
  and pits Mare against the darkness that has grown in her soul."
