description: "The first book in CWA Gold Dagger Award-winning British espionage series\
  \ starring a team of MI5 agents united by one common bond: They've screwed up royally\
  \ and will do anything to redeem themselves. <br /><br />London, England: Slough\
  \ House is where the washed-up MI5 spies go to while away what's left of their failed\
  \ careers. The \"slow horses,\" as they\u2019re called, have all disgraced themselves\
  \ in some way to get relegated here. Maybe they messed up an op badly and can't\
  \ be trusted anymore. Maybe they got in the way of an ambitious colleague and had\
  \ the rug yanked out from under them. Maybe they just got too dependent on the bottle\u2014\
  not unusual in this line of work. One thing they all have in common, though, is\
  \ they all want to be back in the action. And most of them would do anything to\
  \ get there\u2500even if it means having to collaborate with one another.<br /><br\
  \ />River Cartwright, one such \u201Cslow horse,\u201D is bitter about his failure\
  \ and about his tedious assignment transcribing cell phone conversations. When a\
  \ young man is abducted and his kidnappers threaten to broadcast his beheading live\
  \ on the Internet, River sees an opportunity to redeem himself. But is the victim\
  \ who he first appears to be? And what\u2019s the kidnappers\u2019 connection with\
  \ a disgraced journalist? As the clock ticks on the execution, River finds that\
  \ everyone has his own agenda."
