description: "This book will literally change the way you think about your next meal.\
  \ Food psychologist Brian Wansink revolutionizes our awareness of how much, what,\
  \ and why we\u2019re eating\u2014often without realizing it. His findings will astound\
  \ you.<br />\_<br />\u2022 Can the size of your plate really influence your appetite?<br\
  \ />\u2022 Why do you eat more when you dine with friends?<br />\u2022 What \u201C\
  hidden persuaders\u201D are used by restaurants and supermarkets to get us to overeat?<br\
  \ />\u2022 How does music or the color of the room influence how much\u2014and how\
  \ fast\u2014we eat?<br />\u2022 How can we \u201Cmindlessly\u201D lose\u2014instead\
  \ of gain\u2014up to twenty pounds in the coming year?<br />\_<br />Starting today,\
  \ you can make more mindful, enjoyable, and healthy choices at the dinner table,\
  \ in the supermarket, at the office\u2014wherever you satisfy your appetite."
