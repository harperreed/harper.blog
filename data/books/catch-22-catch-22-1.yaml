description: "Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone\
  \ of American literature and one of the funniest\u2014and most celebrated\u2014\
  books of all time. In recent years it has been named to \u201Cbest novels\u201D\
  \ lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.<br /><br\
  \ />Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering\
  \ bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has\
  \ never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy\u2014\
  it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly\
  \ to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself\
  \ from the perilous missions he\u2019s assigned, he\u2019ll be in violation of Catch-22,\
  \ a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly\
  \ continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to\
  \ be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.<br\
  \ /><br />This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller\u2019s masterpiece\
  \ with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and\
  \ reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers\
  \ and photos from Joseph Heller\u2019s personal archive; and much more. Here, at\
  \ last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature."
