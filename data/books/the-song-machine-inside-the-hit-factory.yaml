description: "One night in the early 1990s, a young Swedish music producer put a demo\
  \ tape into the cassette deck of his Nissan Micra to listen to on his drive home.\
  \ Before he got there, Denniz PoP knew he wasn\u2019t interested in producing the\
  \ band, a bunch of unknowns called Ace of Base. But when he tried to remove the\
  \ tape, it wouldn\u2019t come out, and no amount of mashing the Eject button would\
  \ dislodge it. After two weeks of listening to the song on repeat, suddenly Denniz\
  \ saw a way to make the tune work. That demo became \u2018All That She Wants\u2019\
  \ and its success led to Ace of Base\u2019s record becoming one of the best-selling\
  \ debut albums ever.<br /><br />From Tin Pan Alley and Motown to Rihanna and Taylor\
  \ Swift, manufactured music has existed since the record industry began. But \u2018\
  All That She Wants\u2019 heralded the arrival of a new type of hitmaker, the faceless\
  \ teams behind the music who painstakingly craft tunes to tweak the brain\u2019\
  s delight in melody, rhythm and repetition.<br /><br />Travelling from New York\
  \ to Los Angeles, Stockholm to Korea, John Seabrook visits the labs that build these\
  \ hits, where teams assemble hook, bridge and chorus to infuriatingly catchy effect.\
  \ If you\u2019ve ever found yourself humming a chart hit you didn\u2019t even know\
  \ you knew, this book will change the way you listen to music."
