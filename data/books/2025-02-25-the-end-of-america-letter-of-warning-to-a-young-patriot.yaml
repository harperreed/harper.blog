description: In a stunning indictment of the Bush administration and Congress, best-selling
  author Naomi Wolf lays out her case for saving American democracy. In authoritative
  research and documentation Wolf explains how events of the last six years parallel
  steps taken in the early years of the 20th century's worst dictatorships such as
  Germany, Russia, China, and Chile.<br /><br /> The book cuts across political parties
  and ideologies and speaks directly to those among us who are concerned about the
  ever-tightening noose being placed around our liberties.<br /><br /> In this timely
  call to arms, Naomi Wolf compels us to face the way our free America is under assault.
  She warns us-with the straight-to-fellow-citizens urgency of one of Thomas Paine's
  revolutionary pamphlets-that we have little time to lose if our children are to
  live in real freedom.<br /><br /> -Recent history has profound lessons for us in
  the U.S. today about how fascist, totalitarian, and other repressive leaders seize
  and maintain power, especially in what were once democracies. The secret is that
  these leaders all tend to take very similar, parallel steps. The Founders of this
  nation were so deeply familiar with tyranny and the habits and practices of tyrants
  that they set up our checks and balances precisely out of fear of what is unfolding
  today. We are seeing these same kinds of tactics now closing down freedoms in America,
  turning our nation into something that in the near future could be quite other than
  the open society in which we grew up and learned to love liberty, - states Wolf.<br
  /><br /> Wolf is taking her message directly to the American people in the most
  accessible form and as part of a large national campaign to reach out to ordinary
  Americans about the dangers we face today. This includes a lecture and speaking
  tour, and being part of the nascent American Freedom Campaign, a grassroots effort
  to ensure that presidential candidates pledge to uphold the constitution and protect
  our liberties from further erosion.<br /><br /> The End of America will shock, enrage,
  and motivate-spurring us to act, as the Founders would have counted on us to do
  in a time such as this, as rebels and patriots-to save our liberty and defend our
  nation.
