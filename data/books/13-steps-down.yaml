description: "Mix Cellini has just moved into a flat in a decaying house in Nottinghill,\
  \ where he plans to pursue his two abiding passions--supermodel Nerissa Nash, whom\
  \ he worships from afar, and the life of serial killer Reggie Christie, hanged fifty\
  \ years earlier for murdering at least eight women. Gwendolen Chawcer, Mix\u2019\
  s eighty-year-old landlady has few interests beside her old books and her new tenant.\
  \ But she does have an intriguing connection to Christie. And when reality intrudes\
  \ into Mix\u2019s life, he turns toi Christie for inspiration and a long pent-up\
  \ violence explodes. Intricately plotted and brilliantly written, <i>13 Steps Down</i>\
  \ enters the minds of these disparate people as they move inexorably toward its\
  \ breathtaking conclusion."
