description: "From the bestselling author of Breasts and Eggs and international literary\
  \ sensation Mieko Kawakami, a sharp and illuminating novel about the impact of violence\
  \ and the power of solidarity in our contemporary societies.<br /><br />Hailed as\
  \ a bold foray into new literary territory, Kawakami\u2019s novel is told in the\
  \ voice of a 14-year-old student subjected to relentless torment for having a lazy\
  \ eye. Instead of resisting, the boy chooses to suffer in complete resignation.\
  \ The only person who understands what he is going through is a female classmate\
  \ who suffers similar treatment at the hands of her tormenters.<br /><br />These\
  \ raw and realistic portrayals of bullying are counterbalanced by textured exposition\
  \ of the philosophical and religious debates concerning violence to which the weak\
  \ are subjected.<br /><br />Kawakami\u2019s simple yet profound new work stands\
  \ as a dazzling testament to her literary talent. There can be little doubt that\
  \ it has cemented her reputation as one of the most important young authors working\
  \ to expand the boundaries of contemporary Japanese literature."
