description: "<i>Alternate Cover Edition can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36310391-parable-of-the-sower\"\
  \ rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. </i><br /><br />In 2025, with the world descending\
  \ into madness and anarchy, one woman begins a fateful journey toward a better future<br\
  \ /><br />Lauren Olamina and her family live in one of the only safe neighborhoods\
  \ remaining on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Behind the walls of their defended\
  \ enclave, Lauren\u2019s father, a preacher, and a handful of other citizens try\
  \ to salvage what remains of a culture that has been destroyed by drugs, disease,\
  \ war, and chronic water shortages. While her father tries to lead people on the\
  \ righteous path, Lauren struggles with hyperempathy, a condition that makes her\
  \ extraordinarily sensitive to the pain of others.<br /><br />When fire destroys\
  \ their compound, Lauren\u2019s family is killed and she is forced out into a world\
  \ that is fraught with danger. With a handful of other refugees, Lauren must make\
  \ her way north to safety, along the way conceiving a revolutionary idea that may\
  \ mean salvation for all mankind.<br /><br />This ebook features an illustrated\
  \ biography of Octavia E. Butler including rare images from the author\u2019s estate."
