description: This is a world divided by blood - red or silver.The Reds are commoners,
  ruled by a Silver elite in possession of god-like superpowers. And to Mare Barrow,
  a seventeen-year-old Red girl from the poverty-stricken Stilts, it seems like nothing
  will ever change.That is, until she finds herself working in the Silver Palace.
  Here, surrounded by the people she hates the most, Mare discovers that, despite
  her red blood, she possesses a deadly power of her own. One that threatens to destroy
  the balance of power.Fearful of Mare's potential, the Silvers hide her in plain
  view, declaring her a long-lost Silver princess, now engaged to a Silver prince.
  Despite knowing that one misstep would mean her death, Mare works silently to help
  the Red Guard, a militant resistance group, and bring down the Silver regime.But
  this is a world of betrayal and lies, and Mare has entered a dangerous dance - Reds
  against Silvers, prince against prince, and Mare against her own heart
