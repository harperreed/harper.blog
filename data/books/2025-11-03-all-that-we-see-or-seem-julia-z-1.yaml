description: "<b>Award\xAD winning author Ken Liu returns with his first sci-fi thriller\
  \ in a brand-new series following former \u201Corphan hacker\u201D Julia Z as she\
  \ is thrust into a high-stakes adventure where she must use her cybersecurity and\
  \ hacking skills to unravel a virtual reality mystery, rescue a kidnapped dream\
  \ artist, and confront the blurred lines between technology, identity, and the power\
  \ of shared dreams.</b><br /><br />Julia Z, a young woman who gained notoriety at\
  \ fourteen as the \u201Corphan hacker,\u201D is trying to live a life of digital\
  \ obscurity in a Boston suburb.<br /> <br />But when a lawyer named Piers\u2014\
  whose famous artist wife, Elli, has been kidnapped by dangerous criminals\u2014\
  barges into her life, Julia decides to put the solitary life she has painstakingly\
  \ created at risk as she can\u2019t walk away from helping Piers and Elli, nor step\
  \ away from the challenge of this digital puzzle. Elli is an onierofex, a dream\
  \ artist, who can weave the dreams of an audience together through a shared virtual\
  \ landscape, live, in a concert-like experience by tapping into each attendee\u2019\
  s waking dream and providing an emotionally resonant and narrative experience. While\
  \ attendees\u2019 dreams are anonymous, Julia discovers that Elli was also providing\
  \ a one-on-one dream experience for the head of an international criminal enterprise,\
  \ and he\u2019s demanding his dreams in return for Elli.<br /> <br />Unraveling\
  \ the real and unreal leads Julia on an adventure that takes her across the country\
  \ and deep into the shadows of her psyche."
