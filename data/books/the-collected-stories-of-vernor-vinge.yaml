description: Since his first published story, "Apartness," appeared in 1965, Vernor
  Vinge has forged a unique and awe-inspiring career in science fiction as his work
  has grown and matured. He is now one of the most celebrated science fiction writers
  in the field , having won the field's top award, the Hugo, for each of his last
  two novels.<br /><br />Now, for the first time, this illustrious author gathers
  all his short fiction into a single volume. This collection is truly the definitive
  Vinge, capturing his visionary ideas at their very best. It also contains a never-before-published
  novella, one that represents precisely what this collection encapsulates--bold,
  unique, challenging science fictional ideas brought to vivid life with compelling
  storytelling.<br /><br />Including such major pieces as "The Ungoverned" and "The
  Blabber," this sumptuous volume will satisfy any reader who loves the sense of wonder,
  and the excitement of great SF.<br /><br />The volume collects Vinge's short fiction
  through 2001 (except "True Names", including Vinge's comments from the earlier two
  volumes.)<br /><br />Contents:<br />"Bookworm, Run!"<br />"The Accomplice"<br />"The
  Peddler's Apprentice" (with Joan D. Vinge)<br />"The Ungoverned"<br />"Long Shot"<br
  />"Apartness"<br />"Conquest by Default"<br />"The Whirligig of Time"<br />"Bomb
  Scare"<br />"The Science Fair"<br />"Gemstone"<br />"Just Peace" (with William Rupp)<br
  />"Original Sin"<br />"The Blabber"<br />"Win A Nobel Prize!" (originally published
  in Nature, Vol 407 No 6805 "Futures")<br />"The Barbarian Princess" (this is also
  the first section of "Tatja Grimm's World")<br />"Fast Times at Fairmont High" (occurs
  in the same milieu as Rainbows End) (winner 2002 Hugo Award for Best Novella)
