description: <i>The Three-Body Problem</i> is the first chance for English-speaking
  readers to experience this multiple award winning phenomenon from China's most beloved
  science fiction author, Liu Cixin.<br /><br />Set against the backdrop of China's
  Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish
  contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures
  the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start
  forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over
  a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion. The result is a science
  fiction masterpiece of enormous scope and vision.
