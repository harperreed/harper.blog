description: "<i>Audiobook duration:</i> 14 hours and 17 minutes<br /><br />Humans\
  \ have three or four colour-detecting cones in their retinas. Mantis shrimp have\
  \ 16. In fact, their eyes seem to have more in common with satellite technology\
  \ than with biological vision as we currently understand it. They have evolved to\
  \ track movement with an acuity no other species can match by processing raw information;\
  \ they may not \u2018see\u2019, in the human sense, at all.<br /><br />Marine molluscs\
  \ called chitons have eyes that are made of stone. Scorpions appear to see with\
  \ their entire bodies. It isn\u2019t only vision that differs from species to species\u2014\
  some animals also have senses we lack entirely. Knifefish navigate by electrical\
  \ charge.<br /><br /><i>An Immense World</i> will take us on an insider\u2019s tour\
  \ of the natural world by describing the biology, physics and chemistry animals\
  \ use to perceive it. We may lack some of their senses, but our own super-sense\
  \ lies in our ability to understand theirs. And in the face of the largest extinction\
  \ event since the meteor that killed the dinosaurs, our only hope of saving other\
  \ species is bound up with our ability to see what they see, and feel what they\
  \ feel."
