description: "After receiving a frantic letter from her newly-wed cousin begging for\
  \ someone to save her from a mysterious doom, Noem\xED Taboada heads to High Place,\
  \ a distant house in the Mexican countryside. She\u2019s not sure what she will\
  \ find\u2014her cousin\u2019s husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and\
  \ Noem\xED knows little about the region. <br /> <br />Noem\xED is also an unlikely\
  \ rescuer: She\u2019s a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns and perfect red\
  \ lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. But she\u2019\
  s also tough and smart, with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not of\
  \ her cousin\u2019s new husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father,\
  \ the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noem\xED; and not even of\
  \ the house itself, which begins to invade Noemi\u2019s dreams with visions of blood\
  \ and doom.<br /> <br />Her only ally in this inhospitable abode is the family\u2019\
  s youngest son. Shy and gentle, he seems to want to help Noem\xED, but might also\
  \ be hiding dark knowledge of his family\u2019s past. For there are many secrets\
  \ behind the walls of High Place. The family\u2019s once colossal wealth and faded\
  \ mining empire kept them from prying eyes, but as Noem\xED digs deeper she unearths\
  \ stories of violence and madness. <br /> <br />And Noem\xED, mesmerized by the\
  \ terrifying yet seductive world of High Place, may soon find it impossible to ever\
  \ leave this enigmatic house behind."
