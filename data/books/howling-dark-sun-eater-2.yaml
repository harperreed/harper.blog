description: The second novel of the galaxy-spanning Sun Eater series merges the best
  of space opera and epic fantasy, as Hadrian Marlowe continues down a path that can
  only end in fire.<br /><br />Hadrian Marlowe is lost. <br /><br />For half a century,
  he has searched the farther suns for the lost planet of Vorgossos, hoping to find
  a way to contact the elusive alien Cielcin. He has not succeeded, and for years
  has wandered among the barbarian Normans as captain of a band of mercenaries.<br
  /><br />Determined to make peace and bring an end to nearly four hundred years of
  war, Hadrian must venture beyond the security of the Sollan Empire and among the
  Extrasolarians who dwell between the stars. There, he will face not only the aliens
  he has come to offer peace, but contend with creatures that once were human, with
  traitors in his midst, and with a meeting that will bring him face to face with
  no less than the oldest enemy of mankind.<br /><br />If he succeeds, he will usher
  in a peace unlike any in recorded history. If he fails...the galaxy will burn.
