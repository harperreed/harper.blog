description: '"From the number one bestselling author of Little Fires Everywhere,
  a deeply suspenseful and heartrending novel about the unbreakable love between a
  mother and child in a society consumed by fear Twelve-year-old Bird Gardner lives
  a quiet existence with his loving but broken father, a former linguist who now shelves
  books in Harvard University''s library. Bird knows to not ask too many questions,
  stand out too much, or stray too far. For a decade, their lives have been governed
  by laws written to preserve "American culture" in the wake of years of economic
  instability and violence. To keep the peace and restore prosperity, the authorities
  are now allowed to relocate children of dissidents, especially those of Asian origin,
  and libraries have been forced to remove books seen as unpatriotic-including the
  work of Bird''s mother, Margaret, a Chinese American poet who left the family when
  he was nine years old. Bird has grown up disavowing his mother and her poems; he
  doesn''t know her work or what happened to her, and he knows he shouldn''t wonder.
  But when he receives a mysterious letter containing only a cryptic drawing, he is
  drawn into a quest to find her. His journey will take him back to the many folktales
  she poured into his head as a child, through the ranks of an underground network
  of librarians, into the lives of the children who have been taken, and finally to
  New York City, where a new act of defiance may be the beginning of much-needed change.
  Our Missing Hearts is an old story made new, of the ways supposedly civilized communities
  can ignore the most searing injustice. It''s a story about the power-and limitations-of
  art to create change, the lessons and legacies we pass on to our children, and how
  any of us can survive a broken world with our hearts intact"--'
