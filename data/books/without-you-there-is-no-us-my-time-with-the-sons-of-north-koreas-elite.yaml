description: 'A haunting memoir of teaching English to the sons of North Korea''s
  ruling class during the last six months of Kim Jong-il''s reign<br /><br />Every
  day, three times a day, the students march in two straight lines, singing praises
  to Kim Jong-il and North Korea: Without you, there is no motherland. Without you,
  there is no us. It is a chilling scene, but gradually Suki Kim, too, learns the
  tune and, without noticing, begins to hum it. It is 2011, and all universities in
  North Korea have been shut down for an entire year, the students sent to construction
  fields - except for the 270 students at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology
  (PUST), a walled compound where portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il look on
  impassively from the walls of every room, and where Suki has accepted a job teaching
  English. Over the next six months, she will eat three meals a day with her young
  charges and struggle to teach them to write, all under the watchful eye of the regime.
  <br /><br />Life at PUST is lonely and claustrophobic, especially for Suki, whose
  letters are read by censors and who must hide her notes and photographs not only
  from her minders but from her colleagues - evangelical Christian missionaries who
  don''t know or choose to ignore that Suki doesn''t share their faith. She is mystified
  by how easily her students lie, unnerved by their obedience to the regime. To them,
  everything in North Korea is the best, the tallest, the most delicious, the envy
  of all nations. Still, she cannot help but love them - their boyish enthusiasm,
  their eagerness to please, the flashes of curiosity that have not yet been extinguished.
  <br /><br />As the weeks pass, she begins to hint at the existence of a world beyond
  their own - at such exotic activities as surfing the Internet or traveling freely
  and, more dangerously, at electoral democracy and other ideas forbidden in a country
  where defectors risk torture and execution. The students in turn offer Suki tantalizing
  glimpses into their lives, from their thoughts on how to impress girls to their
  disappointment that soccer games are only televised when the North Korean team wins.
  Then Kim Jong-il dies, leaving the students devastated, and leading Suki to question
  whether the gulf between her world and theirs can ever be bridged.<br /><br />Without
  You, There Is No Us offers a moving and incalculably rare glimpse of life in the
  world''s most unknowable country, and at the privileged young men she calls "soldiers
  and slaves."'
