description: "A space salvager and her partner make the discovery of a lifetime that\
  \ just might change the universe in this wild, big-ideas space opera from Hugo Award-winning\
  \ author Elizabeth Bear.<br /><br />Halmey Dz and her partner Connla Kurucz are\
  \ salvage operators, living just on the inside of the law...usually. Theirs is the\
  \ perilous and marginal existence\u2014with barely enough chance of striking it\
  \ fantastically big\u2014just once\u2014to keep them coming back for more. They\
  \ pilot their tiny ship into the scars left by unsuccessful White Transitions, searching\
  \ for the relics of lost human and alien vessels. But when they make a shocking\
  \ discovery about an alien species that has been long thought dead, it may be the\
  \ thing that could tip the perilous peace mankind has found into full-out war.<br\
  \ /> <br />Energetic and electrifying, <i>Ancestral Night </i>is a dazzling space\
  \ opera, sure to delight fans of Alastair Reynolds, Iain M. Banks, and Peter F.\
  \ Hamilton."
