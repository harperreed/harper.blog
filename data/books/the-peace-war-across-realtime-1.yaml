description: <i>The Peace War</i> is quintessential hard-science adventure. The Peace
  Authority conquered the world with a weapon that never should have been a weapon--the
  "bobble," a spherical force-field impenetrable by any force known to mankind. Encasing
  governmental installations and military bases in bobbles, the Authority becomes
  virtually omnipotent. But they've never caught Paul Hoehler, the maverick who invented
  the technology, and who has been working quietly for decades to develop a way to
  defeat the Authority. With the help of an underground network of determined, independent
  scientists and a teenager who may be the apprentice genius he's needed for so long,
  he will shake the world, in the fast-paced hard-science thriller that garnered Vinge
  the first of his four Hugo nominations for best novel.
