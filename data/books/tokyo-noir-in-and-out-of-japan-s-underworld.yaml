description: "<strong>A darkly comic sequel to <em>Tokyo Vice</em> that is equal parts\
  \ history lesson, true-crime expos\xE9, and memoir.</strong><br /><br />It\u2019\
  s 2008, and it\u2019s been a while since Jake Adelstein was the only <em>gaijin</em>\
  \ crime reporter for the <em>Yomiuri Shimbun</em>. The global economy is in shambles,\
  \ Jake is off the police beat but still chain-smoking clove cigarettes, and Tadamasa\
  \ Goto, the most powerful boss in the Japanese organised crime world, has been banished\
  \ from the yakuza, giving Adelstein one less enemy to worry about \u2014 for the\
  \ time being. But as he puts his life back together, he discovers that he may be\
  \ no match for his greatest enemy \u2014 himself.<br /><br />And Adelstein has a\
  \ different gig these due diligence work, or using his investigative skills to dig\
  \ up information on entities whose bosses would prefer that some things stay hidden.<br\
  \ /><br />The underworld isn\u2019t what it used to be. Underneath layers of paperwork,\
  \ corporations are thinly veiled fronts for the yakuza. Pachinko parlours are a\
  \ hidden battleground between disenfranchised Korean Japanese and North Korean extortion\
  \ plots. TEPCO, the electric power corporation keeping the lights on for all of\
  \ Tokyo, scrambles to hide its willful oversights that ultimately led to the 2011\
  \ Fukushima meltdown. And the Japanese government shows levels of corruption that\
  \ make the yakuza look like philanthropists in comparison. All this is punctuated\
  \ by personal tragedies no one could have seen coming.<br /><br />In this ambitious\
  \ and riveting work, Jake Adelstein explores what it\u2019s like when you\u2019\
  re in too deep to distinguish the story you chase from the life you live."
