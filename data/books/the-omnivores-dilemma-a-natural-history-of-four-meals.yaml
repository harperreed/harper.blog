description: Today, buffeted by one food fad after another, America is suffering from
  what can only be described as a national eating disorder. Will it be fast food tonight,
  or something organic? Or perhaps something we grew ourselves? The question of what
  to have for dinner has confronted us since man discovered fire. But as Michael Pollan
  explains in this revolutionary book, how we answer it now, at the dawn of the twenty-first
  century, may determine or survival as a species. Packed with profound surprises,
  The Omnivore's Dilemma is changing the way Americans think about the politics, perils,
  and pleasures of eating.
