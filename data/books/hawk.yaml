description: '<p>Years ago, Vlad Taltos came to make his way as a human amidst the
  impossibly tall, fantastically long-lived natives of the Dragaeran Empire. He joined
  the Jhereg, the Dragaeran House (of which there are seventeen) that handles the
  Empire''s vices: gambling, rackets, organized crime. He became a professional assassin.
  He was good at it.</p><p>But that was then, before Vlad and the Jhereg became mortal
  enemies.</p><p>For years, Vlad has run from one end of the Empire to the other,
  avoiding the Jhereg assassins who pursue him. Now, finally, he''s back in the imperial
  capital where his family and friends are. He means to stay there this time. Whatever
  happens. And whatever it takes.</p>'

      description: "\n\n    This is one series set in Steven Brust's <a href=http://www.goodreads.com/series/49760-draegara>Draegaran\
        \ world.</a>\r\n    \r\n    Of the ordering, the author notes:<blockquote>One\
        \ of the questions I'm most often asked is: \"In what order would you recommend\
        \ reading these books?\" Unfortunately, I'm just exactly the wrong guy to\
        \ ask. I made every effort to write them so that they could be read in any\
        \ order. I am aware that, in some measure at least, I have failed (I certainly\
        \ wouldn't recommend starting with <i>Teckla</i>, for example), but the fact\
        \ that I was trying makes me incapable of giving an answer.\r\n    \r\n  \
        \  Many people whose opinion I respect believe publication order is best .\
        \ . . The choice, I daresay, is yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy them.\r\
        \n    \r\n    --Steven Brust, 1999, in the notes for <i>The Book of Jhereg</i></blockquote>The\
        \ books are numbered in publication order;  here is a rough guide to chronological\
        \ order:\r\n    \r\n        Taltos (1988)\r\n        Dragon (1998)\r\n   \
        \     Yendi (1984)\r\n        Tiassa, section 1 (2011)\r\n        Jhereg (1983)\r\
        \n        Teckla (1987)\r\n        Phoenix (1990)\r\n        Jhegaala (2008)\r\
        \n        Athyra (1993)\r\n        Orca (1996)\r\n        Issola (2001)\r\n\
        \        Dzur (2006)\r\n        Tiassa, section 2 (2011)\r\n        Iorich\
