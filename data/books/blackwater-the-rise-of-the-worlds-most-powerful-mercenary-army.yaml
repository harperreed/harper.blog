description: <b>The groundbreaking bestselling expose of the shadowy mercenary army
  that perpetrated horrific war crimes in America's name.</b> On September 16, 2007,
  machine gun fire erupted in Baghdad's Nisour Square, leaving seventeen Iraqi civilians
  dead, among them women and children. The shooting spree, labeled "Baghdad's Bloody
  Sunday," was neither the work of Iraqi insurgents nor U.S. soldiers. The shooters
  were private forces, subcontractors working for the secretive mercenary company,
  Blackwater Worldwide, led by Erik Prince<br /><br /> Award-winning journalist Jeremy
  Scahill takes us from the bloodied streets of Iraq to hurricane-ravaged New Orleans
  to the chambers of power in Washington, to reveal the frightening new face of the
  U.S. military machine, and what happens when you outsource war.<b>"A crackling expose"
  -- <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><b>"[Scahill] is a one-man truth squad"
  -- Bill Moyers</b><b>"[An] utterly gripping and explosive story" -- Naomi Klein,
  <i>The Guardian</i></b>
