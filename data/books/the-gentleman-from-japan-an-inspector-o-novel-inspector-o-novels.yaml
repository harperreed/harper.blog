description: "<p>James Church\u2019s Inspector O novels have been hailed as \u201C\
  crackling good\u201D (<i>The Washington Post</i>). Now Church\u2014a former Western\
  \ intelligence officer who pulls back the curtain on the hidden world of North Korea\
  \ in a way that no one else can\u2014comes roaring back with an unputdownable new\
  \ novel.</p><p>A Spanish factory near Barcelona is secretly producing\u2014under\
  \ the guise of a dumpling maker\u2014a key machine for the production of nuclear\
  \ weapons. Western intelligence has gotten wind of this and believes that the machine\
  \ is meant for North Korea. It is deemed imperative either to disable the machine\
  \ before it leaves the factory or intercept it. Inspector O is recruited by an old\
  \ friend to take part in an operation to disrupt the plans for shipping the machine.</p><p>The\
  \ buyer of the machine has constructed an elaborate double-blind story, making it\
  \ appear as if the purchaser is a Japanese criminal organization acting on behalf\
  \ of the North Koreans. Information has been carefully planted and events set up\
  \ to lead Western intelligence operatives to that conclusion. The feints include\
  \ a flurry of murders in the northeast Chinese city of Yanji, on the border with\
  \ North Korea, where O\u2019s nephew is the chief of State Security.</p><p>Church's\
  \ latest Inspector O novel full of suspense, is not one that you will be able to\
  \ stop reading.</p>"
