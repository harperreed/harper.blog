description: "The Trojan War rages at the foot of Olympos Mons on Mars\u2014observed\
  \ and influenced from on high by Zeus and his immortal family\u2014and twenty-first-century\
  \ professor Thomas Hockenberry is there to play a role in the insidious private\
  \ wars of vengeful gods and goddesses. On Earth, a small band of the few remaining\
  \ humans pursues a lost past and devastating truth\u2014as four sentient machines\
  \ depart from Jovian space to investigate, perhaps terminate, the potentially catastrophic\
  \ emissions emanating from a mountaintop miles above the terraformed surface of\
  \ the Red Planet."
