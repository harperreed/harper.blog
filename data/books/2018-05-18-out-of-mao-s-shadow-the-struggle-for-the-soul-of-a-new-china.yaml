description: From an award-winning journalist for <i>The Washington Post</i> and one
  of the leading China correspondents of his generation comes an eloquent and vivid
  chronicle of the world's most successful authoritarian state -- a nation undergoing
  a remarkable transformation. <br /> <br /> Philip P. Pan's groundbreaking book takes
  us inside the dramatic battle for China's soul and into the lives of individuals
  struggling to come to terms with their nation's past -- the turmoil and trauma of
  Mao's rule -- and to take control of its future. Capitalism has brought prosperity
  and global respect to China, but the Communist government continues to resist the
  demands of its people for political freedom. <br /> <br /> Pan, who reported in
  China for the <i>Post</i> for seven years and speaks fluent Chinese, eluded the
  police and succeeded in going where few Western journalists have dared. <br /> <br
  /> From the rusting factories in the industrial northeast to a tabloid newsroom
  in the booming south, from a small-town courtroom to the plush offices of the nation's
  wealthiest tycoons, he tells the gripping stories of ordinary men and women fighting
  for political change. An elderly surgeon exposes the government's cover-up of the
  SARS epidemic. A filmmaker investigates the execution of a young woman during the
  Cultural Revolution. A blind man is jailed for leading a crusade against forced
  abortions carried out under the one-child policy. <br /> <br /> The young people
  who filled Tiananmen Square in the spring of 1989 saw their hopes for a democratic
  China crushed in a massacre, but Pan reveals that as older, more pragmatic adults,
  many continue to push for justice in different ways. They are survivors whose families
  endured one of the world's deadliest famines during the Great Leap Forward, whose
  idealism was exploited during the madness of the Cultural Revolution, and whose
  values have been tested by the booming economy and the rush to get rich.
