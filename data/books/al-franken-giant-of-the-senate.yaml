description: 'From Senator Al Franken - #1 bestselling author and beloved SNL alum
  - comes the story of an award-winning comedian who decided to run for office and
  then discovered why award-winning comedians tend not to do that.<br /><br />This
  is a book about an unlikely campaign that had an even more improbable ending: the
  closest outcome in history and an unprecedented eight-month recount saga, which
  is pretty funny in retrospect.<br /><br />It''s a book about what happens when the
  nation''s foremost progressive satirist gets a chance to serve in the United States
  Senate and, defying the low expectations of the pundit class, actually turns out
  to be good at it.<br /><br />It''s a book about our deeply polarized, frequently
  depressing, occasionally inspiring political culture, written from inside the belly
  of the beast.<br /><br />In this candid personal memoir, the honorable gentleman
  from Minnesota takes his army of loyal fans along with him from Saturday Night Live
  to the campaign trail, inside the halls of Congress, and behind the scenes of some
  of the most dramatic and/or hilarious moments of his new career in politics.<br
  /><br />Has Al Franken become a true Giant of the Senate? Franken asks readers to
  decide for themselves.'
