description: "\u201CTwenty-four years ago, we began our work together, drawing back\
  \ the veil of ignorance that conceals the world\u2019s cruelties. We hoped to inspire\
  \ our audience to become less cruel, less harmful. This is not what has happened.\"\
  \ <br /><br />Su lit a fire. <br />Rayen taught her friends how to kill. <br />Julia's\
  \ ex started an epidemic. <br />But the Crosses are greater than the sum of their\
  \ parts. <br /><br />Among the jaded youth, a new ideology is gaining popularity,\
  \ one that poses a threat to all humanity. <br /><br />The revolution will be global,\
  \ panlingual, and single-mindedly merciless."
