description: An incisive and compelling account of the case of Lucie Blackman. Lucie
  Blackman - tall, blonde, and 21 years old - stepped out into the vastness of Tokyo
  in the summer of 2000, and disappeared forever. The following winter, her dismembered
  remains were found buried in a seaside cave. <br /><br />The seven months in between
  had seen a massive search for the missing girl, involving Japanese policemen, British
  private detectives, Australian dowsers and Lucie's desperate, but bitterly divided,
  parents. As the case unfolded, it drew the attention of prime ministers and sado-masochists,
  ambassadors and con-men, and reporters from across the world. Had Lucie been abducted
  by a religious cult, or snatched by human traffickers? Who was the mysterious man
  she had gone to meet? And what did her work, as a 'hostess' in the notorious Roppongi
  district of Tokyo, really involve?<br /><br />Richard Lloyd Parry, an award-winning
  foreign correspondent, has followed the case since Lucie's disappearance. Over the
  course of a decade, he has travelled to four continents to interview those caught
  up in the story, fought off a legal attack in the Japanese courts, and worked undercover
  as a barman in a Roppongi strip club. He has talked exhaustively to Lucie's friends
  and family and won unique access to the Japanese detectives who investigated the
  case. And he has delved into the mind and background of the man accused of the crime
  - Joji Obara, described by the judge as 'unprecedented and extremely evil'.<br /><br
  />With the finesse of a novelist, he reveals the astonishing truth about Lucie and
  her fate. <br /><br />'People Who Eat Darkness' is, by turns, a non-fiction thriller,
  a courtroom drama and the biography of both a victim and a killer. It is the story
  of a young woman who fell prey to unspeakable evil, and of a loving family torn
  apart by grief. And it is a fascinating insight into one of the world's most baffling
  and mysterious societies, a light shone into dark corners of Japan that the rest
  of the world has never glimpsed before.
