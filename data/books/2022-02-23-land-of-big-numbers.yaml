description: "A debut collection from an extraordinary new talent that vividly gives\
  \ voice to the men and women of modern China and its diaspora.<br /><br />Gripping\
  \ and compassionate, <i>Land of Big Numbers</i> depicts the diverse and legion Chinese\
  \ people, their history, their government, and how all of that has tumbled\u2014\
  messily, violently, but still beautifully\u2014into the present.<br /><br />Cutting\
  \ between clear-eyed realism and tongue-in-cheek magical realism, Chen\u2019s stories\
  \ coalesce into a portrait of a people striving for openings where mobility is limited.\
  \ Twins take radically different one becomes a professional gamer, the other a political\
  \ activist. A woman moves to the city to work at a government call center and is\
  \ followed by her violent ex-boyfriend. A man is swept into the high-risk, high-reward\
  \ temptations of China\u2019s volatile stock exchange. And a group of people sit,\
  \ trapped for no reason, on a subway platform for months, waiting for official permission\
  \ to leave.<br /><br />With acute social insight, Te-Ping Chen layers years of experience\
  \ reporting on the ground in China with incantatory prose in this taut, surprising\
  \ debut, proving herself both a remarkable cultural critic and an astonishingly\
  \ accomplished new literary voice."
