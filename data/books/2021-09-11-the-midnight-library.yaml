description: Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that
  contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One
  tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life
  you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life.
  While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to
  go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be
  better?<br /><br />In <i>The Midnight Library</i>, Matt Haig's enchanting blockbuster
  novel, Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility
  of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups,
  realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself
  as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in
  life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.
