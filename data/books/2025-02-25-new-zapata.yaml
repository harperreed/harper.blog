description: "It\u2019s 2052, and there\u2019s one less state in the union. Texas,\
  \ now known as the Republic of Texas, has seceded, just like it did in 1861, though\
  \ for different reasons this time. <br /> <br />Rebecca lives in New Zapata, a border\
  \ town in The Republic of Texas. She\u2019s nineteen years old, born and raised\
  \ in the R of T, and doesn\u2019t remember a time when things were different, though\
  \ her Aunt Cathy does. Rebecca\u2019s married to Chad, the boy who charmed her into\
  \ an unplanned pregnancy. She loves her young son, Luke, but she almost died giving\
  \ birth to him.<br /><br />That means Rebecca has a problem. Because in New Zapata,\
  \ birth control and abortion are illegal. So is divorce. And Chad thinks sex is\
  \ his husbandly right. <br /> <br />There\u2019s an underground of sorts in The\
  \ R of T, and it reaches even as far as sleepy New Zapata. A group of older women\u2014\
  Rebecca\u2019s Aunt Cathy and some others\u2014have been gathering under the guise\
  \ of having Bunco parties to try to help women in Rebecca\u2019s position. These\
  \ ladies remember a time when things were different, when women did have choices.\
  \ <br /><br />But it\u2019s a dangerous game to defy the R of T. <br /><br />Rebecca\
  \ and her friends may end up playing for their lives."
