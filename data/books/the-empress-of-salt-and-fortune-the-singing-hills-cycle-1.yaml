description: '<i>Librarian''s note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition
  of this book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51190882" rel="nofollow
  noopener">here</a>.</i><br /><br />With the heart of an Atwood tale and the visuals
  of a classic Asian period drama <i>The Empress of Salt and Fortune</i> is a tightly
  and lushly written narrative about empire, storytelling, and the anger of women.
  <br /><br />A young royal from the far north is sent south for a political marriage.
  Alone and sometimes reviled, she has only her servants on her side. This evocative
  debut chronicles her rise to power through the eyes of her handmaiden, at once feminist
  high fantasy and a thrilling indictment of monarchy.'
