description: The Twin Novae battle had been one of the last of the Idiran war, one
  of the most horrific. Desperate to avert defeat, the Idirans had induced not one
  but two suns to explode, snuffing out worlds &amp; biospheres teeming with sentient
  life. They were attacks of incredible proportion - gigadeathcrimes. But the war
  ended and life went on. Now, 800 years later, light from the 1st explosion is about
  to reach the Masaq' Orbital, home to the Culture's most adventurous &amp; decadent
  souls. There it will fall upon Masaq's 50 billion inhabitants, gathered to commemorate
  the deaths of the innocent &amp; to reflect, if only for a moment, on what some
  call the Culture's own complicity in the terrible event.<br /><br />Also journeying
  to Masaq' is Major Quilan, an emissary from the war-ravaged world of Chel. In the
  aftermath of the conflict that split his world apart, most believe he has come to
  Masaq' to bring home Chel's most brilliant star &amp; self-exiled dissident, the
  honored Composer Ziller. Ziller claims he will do anything to avoid a meeting with
  Quilan, who he suspects has come to murder him. But the Major's true assignment
  will have far greater consequences than the death of a mere political dissident,
  as part of a conspiracy more ambitious than even he can know--a mission his superiors
  have buried so deeply in his mind that even he can't remember it.<br /> <br /> Hailed
  by SFX magazine as "an excellent hopping-on point if you've never read a Banks SF
  novel before," <i>Look to Windward</i> is an awe-inspiring immersion into the wildly
  original, vividly realized civilization Banks calls the Culture.
