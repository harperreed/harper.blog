description: '<b>What if our civilization is more advanced than we know?</b><br /><br
  />The New York Times bestselling author of Daemon--"the cyberthriller against which
  all others will be measured" -Publishers Weekly) --imagines a world in which decades
  of technological advances have been suppressed in an effort to prevent disruptive
  change.<br /><br />Are smart phones really humanity''s most significant innovation
  since the moon landings? Or can something else explain why the bold visions of the
  20th century--fusion power, genetic enhancements, artificial intelligence, cures
  for common disease, extended human life, and a host of other world-changing advances--have
  remained beyond our grasp? Why has the high-tech future that seemed imminent in
  the 1960''s failed to arrive?<br /><br />Perhaps it did arrive...but only for a
  select few.<br /><br />Particle physicist Jon Grady is ecstatic when his team achieves
  what they''ve been working toward for years: a device that can reflect gravity.
  Their research will revolutionize the field of physics--the crowning achievement
  of a career. Grady expects widespread acclaim for his entire team. The Nobel. Instead,
  his lab is locked down by a shadowy organization whose mission is to prevent at
  all costs the social upheaval sudden technological advances bring. This Bureau of
  Technology Control uses the advanced technologies they have harvested over the decades
  to fulfill their mission.<br /><br />They are living in our future.<br /><br />Presented
  with the opportunity to join the BTC and improve his own technology in secret, Grady
  balks, and is instead thrown into a nightmarish high-tech prison built to hold rebellious
  geniuses like himself. With so many great intellects confined together, can Grady
  and his fellow prisoners conceive of a way to usher humanity out of its artificial
  dark age?<br /><br />And when they do, is it possible to defeat an enemy that wields
  a technological advantage half a century in the making?'
