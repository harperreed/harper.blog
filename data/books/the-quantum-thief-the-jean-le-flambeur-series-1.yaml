description: "Jean le Flambeur gets up in the morning and has to kill himself before\
  \ his other self can kill him first. Just another day in the Dilemma Prison. Rescued\
  \ by the mysterious Mieli and her flirtatious spacecraft, Jean is taken to the Oubliette,\
  \ the Moving City of Mars, where time is a currency, memories are treasures, and\
  \ a moon-turned-singularity lights the night. Meanwhile, investigator Isidore Beautrelet,\
  \ called in to investigate the murder of a chocolatier, finds himself on the trail\
  \ of an arch-criminal, a man named le Flambeur...<br /><br />Indeed, in his many\
  \ lives, the entity called Jean le Flambeur has been a thief, a confidence artist,\
  \ a posthuman mind-burgler, and more. His origins are shrouded in mystery, but his\
  \ deeds are known throughout the Heterarchy, from breaking into the vast Zeusbrains\
  \ of the Inner System to stealing rare Earth antiques from the aristocrats of Mars.\
  \ In his last exploit, he managed the supreme feat of hiding the truth about himself\
  \ from the one person in the solar system hardest to hide from: himself. Now he\
  \ has the chance to regain himself in all his power\u2014in exchange for finishing\
  \ the one heist he never quite managed.<br /><br />The Quantum Thief is a breathtaking\
  \ joyride through the solar system several centuries hence, a world of marching\
  \ cities, ubiquitous public-key encryption, people who communicate via shared memory,\
  \ and a race of hyper-advanced humans who originated as an MMORPG guild. But for\
  \ all its wonders, The Quantum Thief is also a story powered by very human motives\
  \ of betrayal, jealousy, and revenge."
