description: "John Scalzi returns with Head On, the standalone follow-up to the New\
  \ York Times bestselling and critically acclaimed Lock In. Chilling near-future\
  \ SF with the thrills of a gritty cop procedural, Head On brings Scalzi's trademark\
  \ snappy dialogue and technological speculation to the future world of sports.<br\
  \ /><br />Hilketa is a frenetic and violent pastime where players attack each other\
  \ with swords and hammers. The main goal of the game: obtain your opponent\u2019\
  s head and carry it through the goalposts. With flesh and bone bodies, a sport like\
  \ this would be impossible. But all the players are \u201Cthreeps,\u201D robot-like\
  \ bodies controlled by people with Haden\u2019s Syndrome, so anything goes. No one\
  \ gets hurt, but the brutality is real and the crowds love it.<br /><br />Until\
  \ a star athlete drops dead on the playing field.<br /><br />Is it an accident or\
  \ murder? FBI Agents and Haden-related crime investigators, Chris Shane and Leslie\
  \ Vann, are called in to uncover the truth\u2015and in doing so travel to the darker\
  \ side of the fast-growing sport of Hilketa, where fortunes are made or lost, and\
  \ where players and owners do whatever it takes to win, on and off the field."
