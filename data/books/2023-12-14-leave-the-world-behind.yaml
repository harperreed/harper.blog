description: A magnetic novel about two families, strangers to each other, who are
  forced together on a long weekend gone terribly wrong<br /><br />Amanda and Clay
  head to a remote corner of Long Island expecting a a quiet reprieve from life in
  New York City, quality time with their teenage son and daughter and a taste of the
  good life in the luxurious home they've rented for the week. But with a late-night
  knock on the door, the spell is broken. Ruth and G. H., an older couple who claim
  to own the home, have arrived there in a panic. These strangers say that a sudden
  power outage has swept the city, and - with nowhere else to turn - they have come
  to the country in search of shelter.<br /><br />But with the TV and internet down,
  and no phone service, the facts are unknowable. Should Amanda and Clay trust this
  couple - and vice versa? What has happened back in New York? Is the holiday home,
  isolated from civilisation, a truly safe place for their families? And are they
  safe from one another?
