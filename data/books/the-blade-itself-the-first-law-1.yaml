description: "Logen Ninefingers, infamous barbarian, has finally run out of luck.\
  \ Caught in one feud too many, he\u2019s on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian\
  \ \u2013 leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy\
  \ enemies. <br /><br />Nobleman Captain Jezal dan Luthar, dashing officer, and paragon\
  \ of selfishness, has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at\
  \ cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on\
  \ the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules.\
  \ <br /><br />Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better\
  \ than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting\
  \ treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship.\
  \ His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government,\
  \ if he can stay alive long enough to follow it. <br /><br />Enter the wizard, Bayaz.\
  \ A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the\
  \ First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about\
  \ to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glotka a whole lot more difficult. <br\
  \ /><br />Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be\
  \ settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood."
