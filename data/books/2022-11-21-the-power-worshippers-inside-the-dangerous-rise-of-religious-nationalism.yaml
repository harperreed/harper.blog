description: '<b>For readers of <i>Democracy in Chains</i> and <i>Dark Money</i>,
  a revelatory investigation of the Religious Right''s rise to political power.</b><br
  /> <br />For too long the Religious Right has masqueraded as a social movement preoccupied
  with a number of cultural issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage. But in
  her deeply reported investigation, Katherine Stewart reveals a disturbing truth:
  America''s Religious Right has evolved into a Christian nationalist movement. It
  seeks to gain political power and to impose its vision on all of society. It isn''t
  fighting a culture war, it is waging a political war on the norms and institutions
  of American democracy.<br /> <br />Stewart shows that the real power of the movement
  lies in a dense network of think tanks, advocacy groups, and pastoral organizations,
  embedded in a rapidly expanding community of international alliances with likeminded,
  anti-democratic religious nationalists around the world, including Russia. She follows
  the money behind the movement and traces much of it to a group of super-wealthy,
  ultraconservative donors and family foundations. The Christian nationalist movement
  is far more organized and better funded than most people realize. It seeks to control
  all aspects of government and society. Its successes have been stunning, and its
  influence now extends to every aspect of American life, from the White House to
  state capitols, from our schools to our hospitals.<br /><i> </i><br /><i>The Power
  Worshippers</i> is a brilliantly reported book of warning and a wake-up call. Stewart''s
  probing examination demands that Christian nationalism be taken seriously as a significant
  threat to the American republic and our democratic freedoms.'
