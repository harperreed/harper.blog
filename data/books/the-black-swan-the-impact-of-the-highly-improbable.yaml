description: "A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics:\
  \ It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct\
  \ an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it\
  \ was. <br /><br />The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11.\
  \ For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world,\
  \ from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.<br /><br />Why\
  \ do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part\
  \ of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics\
  \ when they should be focused on generalities. <br /><br />We concentrate on things\
  \ we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we\
  \ don\u2019t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too\
  \ vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough\
  \ to rewarding those who can imagine the \u201Cimpossible.\u201D<br /><br />For\
  \ years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than\
  \ we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential,\
  \ while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory\
  \ book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don\u2019t know. He offers\
  \ surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.<br\
  \ /><br />Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications <i>The Black Swan</i>\
  \ will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer,\
  \ with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command\
  \ of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory.\
  \ <br /><br /><i>The Black Swan</i> is a landmark book \u2013 itself a black swan.<br\
  \ /><br />The book also contains a 4-page glossary; 19 pages of notes; and, a 28-page\
  \ bibliography in addition to an index."
