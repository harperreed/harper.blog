description: 'Nuclear war begins with a blip on a radar screen.<br />This is a minute-by-minute
  account of what comes next.<br />It has to be read to be believed.<br /><br />There
  is only one scenario other than an asteroid strike that could end the world as we
  know it in a matter of hours: nuclear war.<br /><br />Until now, no one outside
  official circles has known exactly what would happen if a rogue state launched a
  nuclear missile at the Pentagon. Second by second and minute by minute, these are
  the real-life protocols that choreograph the end of civilization as we know it.<br
  /><br />Decisions that affect hundreds of millions of lives need to be made within
  six minutes, based on partial information, in the knowledge that once launched,
  nothing is capable of halting the destruction.<br />Based on dozens of new interviews
  with military and civilian experts who have built the weapons, been privy to the
  response plans, and taken responsibility for crucial decisions, this is the only
  account of what a nuclear exchange would look like.<br />Nuclear War is at once
  a compulsive non-fiction thriller and a powerful argument that we must rid ourselves
  of these world-ending weapons for ever.'
