description: 'Alex Kotlowitz''s <i>There Are No Children Here</i> was more than a
  bestseller; it was a national event. His beautifully narrated, heartbreaking nonfiction
  account of two black boys struggling to grow up in a Chicago public housing complex
  spent eight weeks on <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller list, was a made-for-television
  movie starring and produced by Oprah Winfrey, won many distinguished awards, and
  sparked a continuing national debate on the lives of inner-city children.<br /><br
  />In <i>The Other Side of the River,</i> his eagerly awaited new book, Kotlowitz
  takes us to southern Michigan. Here, separated by the St. Joseph River, are two
  towns, St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. Geographically close, they are worlds apart,
  a living metaphor for America''s racial divisions: St. Joseph is a prosperous lakeshore
  community and ninety-five percent white, while Benton Harbor is impoverished and
  ninety-two percent black. When the body of a black teenaged boy from Benton Harbor
  is found in the river, unhealed wounds and suspicions between the two towns'' populations
  surface as well. The investigation into the young man''s death becomes, inevitably,
  a screen on which each town projects their resentments and fears.<br /><br /><i>The
  Other Side of the River</i> sensitively portrays the lives and hopes of the towns''
  citizens as they wrestle with this mystery--and reveals the attitudes and misperceptions
  that undermine race relations throughout America. In this gripping and ultimately
  profound book, Alex Kotlowitz proves why he is one of this country''s foremost writers
  on the ever explosive issue of race.<br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'
