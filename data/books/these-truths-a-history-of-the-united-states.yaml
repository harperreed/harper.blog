description: "<strong>In the most ambitious one-volume American history in decades,\
  \ award-winning historian and <em>New Yorker</em> writer Jill Lepore offers a magisterial\
  \ account of the origins and rise of a divided nation, an urgently needed reckoning\
  \ with the beauty and tragedy of American history.</strong><br /><br />Written in\
  \ elegiac prose, Lepore\u2019s groundbreaking investigation places truth itself\u2014\
  a devotion to facts, proof, and evidence\u2014at the center of the nation\u2019\
  s history. The American experiment rests on three ideas\u2014\"these truths,\" Jefferson\
  \ called them\u2014political equality, natural rights, and the sovereignty of the\
  \ people. And it rests, too, on a fearless dedication to inquiry, Lepore argues,\
  \ because self-government depends on it. But has the nation, and democracy itself,\
  \ delivered on that promise?<br /><br /><em>These Truths</em> tells this uniquely\
  \ American story, beginning in 1492, asking whether the course of events over more\
  \ than five centuries has proven the nation\u2019s truths, or belied them. To answer\
  \ that question, Lepore traces the intertwined histories of American politics, law,\
  \ journalism, and technology, from the colonial town meeting to the nineteenth-century\
  \ party machine, from talk radio to twenty-first-century Internet polls, from Magna\
  \ Carta to the Patriot Act, from the printing press to Facebook News.<br /><br />Along\
  \ the way, Lepore\u2019s sovereign chronicle is filled with arresting sketches of\
  \ both well-known and lesser-known Americans, from a parade of presidents and a\
  \ rogues\u2019 gallery of political mischief makers to the intrepid leaders of protest\
  \ movements, including Frederick Douglass, the famed abolitionist orator; William\
  \ Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate and ultimately tragic populist;\
  \ Pauli Murray, the visionary civil rights strategist; and Phyllis Schlafly, the\
  \ uncredited architect of modern conservatism.<br /><br />Americans are descended\
  \ from slaves and slave owners, from conquerors and the conquered, from immigrants\
  \ and from people who have fought to end immigration. \"A nation born in contradiction\
  \ will fight forever over the meaning of its history,\" Lepore writes, but engaging\
  \ in that struggle by studying the past is part of the work of citizenship. \"The\
  \ past is an inheritance, a gift and a burden,\" <em>These Truths</em> observes.\
  \ \"It can\u2019t be shirked. There\u2019s nothing for it but to get to know it.\""
