description: "Defeated, crushed, and driven almost to extinction, the remnants of\
  \ the human race are trapped on a planet that is constantly attacked by mysterious\
  \ alien starfighters. Spensa, a teenage girl living among them, longs to be a pilot.\
  \ When she discovers the wreckage of an ancient ship, she realizes this dream might\
  \ be possible\u2014assuming she can repair the ship, navigate flight school, and\
  \ (perhaps most importantly) persuade the strange machine to help her. Because this\
  \ ship, uniquely, appears to have a soul."
