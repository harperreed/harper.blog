description: "In December 1937, in what was then the capital of China, one of the\
  \ most brutal massacres in the long annals of wartime barbarity occurred. The Japanese\
  \ army swept into the ancient city of Nanking (Nanjing) and within weeks not only\
  \ looted and burned the defenseless city but systematically raped, tortured, and\
  \ murdered more than 300,000 Chinese civilians. Amazingly, the story of this atrocity\u2014\
  one of the worst in world history\u2014continues to be denied by the Japanese government.Based\
  \ on extensive interviews with survivors and newly discovered documents in four\
  \ different languages (many never before published), Iris Chang, whose own grandparents\
  \ barely escaped the massacre, has written what will surely be the definitive, English-language\
  \ history of this horrifying episode\u2014one that the Japanese have tried for years\
  \ to erase from public consciousness.<i>The Rape of Nanking</i> tells the story\
  \ from three that of the Japanese soldiers who performed it; of the Chinese civilians\
  \ who endured it; and finally of a group of Europeans and Americans who refused\
  \ to abandon the city and were able to create a safety zone that saved almost 300,000\
  \ Chinese. It was Chang who discovered the diaries of the German leader of this\
  \ rescue effort, John Rabe, whom she calls the \u201COskar Schindler of China.\u201D\
  \ A loyal supporter of Adolf Hitler but far from the terror planned in his Nazi-controlled\
  \ homeland, he worked tirelessly to save the innocent from slaughter.But this book\
  \ does more than just narrate details of an orgy of violence; it attempts to analyze\
  \ the degree to which the Japanese imperial government and its militaristic culture\
  \ fostered in the Japanese soldier a total disregard for human life.Finally, it\
  \ tells one more shocking Despite the fact that the death toll at Nanking exceeded\
  \ the immediate deaths from the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined\
  \ (and even the total wartime casualty count of entire European countries), the\
