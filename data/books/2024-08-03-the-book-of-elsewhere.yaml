description: "She said, We needed a tool. So I asked the gods.<br /><br />There have\
  \ always been whispers. Legends. The warrior who cannot be killed. Who\u2019s seen\
  \ a thousand civilizations rise and fall. He has had many names: Unute, Child of\
  \ Lightning, Death himself. These days, he\u2019s known simply as \u201CB.\u201D\
  <br /><br />And he wants to be able to die.<br /> <br />In the present day, a U.S.\
  \ black-ops group has promised him they can help with that. And all he needs to\
  \ do is help them in return. But when an all-too-mortal soldier comes back to life,\
  \ the impossible event ultimately points toward a force even more mysterious than\
  \ B himself. One at least as strong. And one with a plan all its own.<br /><br /><i>A\
  \ mind-blowing epic of ancient powers, modern war, and an outcast who cannot die.\
  \ Combines Mi\xE9ville\u2019s singular style and creativity with Reeves\u2019s haunting\
  \ and soul-stirring narrative, unlike anything these two genre-bending pioneers\
  \ have created before, inspired by the world of the BRZRKR comic books.</i>"
