description: "Glen Runciter is dead. Or is everybody else? <i>Someone</i> died in\
  \ an explosion orchestrated by Runciter's business competitors. And, indeed, it's\
  \ the kingly Runciter whose funeral is scheduled in Des Moines. But in the meantime,\
  \ his mourning employees are receiving bewildering \u2014 and sometimes scatological\
  \ \u2014 messages from their boss. And the world around them is warping in ways\
  \ that suggest that their own time is running out. Or already has.<br /><br />Philip\
  \ K. Dick's searing metaphysical comedy of death and salvation (the latter available\
  \ in a convenient aerosol spray) is a tour de force of paranoiac menace and unfettered\
  \ slapstick, in which the departed give business advice, shop for their next incarnation,\
  \ and run the continual risk of dying yet again.<br /><br />"
