description: '<b>An audacious marvel of a novel about baseball and a future America,
  from the always inventive and exciting author of <i>The Love Wife</i> and <i>Who''s
  Irish</i></b><br /><br />The a not-so-distant future. The AutoAmerica. The half
  under water. The Internet--the new face of government--is "Aunt Nettie": a mix of
  artificial intelligence, surveillance technology, and pesky maxims. The people have
  been divided, and no one is happy. The angel-fair "Netted" still have jobs and literally
  occupy the high ground, while the mostly coppertoned "Surplus" live on swampland
  if they''re lucky, on the water if they''re not. <br /> The To a Surplus couple--he
  <i>was</i> a professor, she''s still a lawyer--is born a Blasian girl with a golden
  arm. At two, Gwen is hurling her stuffed animals from the crib; by ten she can hit
  whatever target she likes with a baseball; her teens find her playing happily in
  an underground Surplus league. When AutoAmerica re-enters the Olympics--with a special
  eye on beating ChinRussia--Gwen attracts interest. Soon she''s at Net U, falling
  in love with her coach and considering "crossing over," even as her mother is challenging
  the AutoAmerican Way with lawsuits that will prove very dangerous.<br /> An astonishing
  story of an America that seems only too possible, and of a family struggling to
  maintain its humanity in circumstances that threaten their every value--even their
  very existence.'
