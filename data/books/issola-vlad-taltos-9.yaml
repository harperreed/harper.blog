description: "Okay, so maybe I've been living in the woods too long, where you can't\
  \ even get a decent cup of klava first thing in the morning. So who should turn\
  \ up but Lady Teldra, the courtly servant of my old friend the Dragonlord Morrolan?\_\
  Teldra wants my help, because Morrolan and Aliera have disappeared, and according\
  \ to Sethra Lavode, it looks like they may be in the hands of the Jenoine. Do I\
  \ want to mess with them? The guys who made this place? And I thought I had problems\
  \ before...\_Oh well, what's a little cosmic battle with beings who control time\
  \ and space? It's better than hunkering down in the woods without even so much as\
  \ a drinkable cup of klava.\_In <i>Issola</i>, Stephen Brust delivers another swashbuckling\
  \ fantasy adventure for Vlad Taltos."

      description: "\n\n    This is one series set in Steven Brust's <a href=http://www.goodreads.com/series/49760-draegara>Draegaran\
        \ world.</a>\r\n    \r\n    Of the ordering, the author notes:<blockquote>One\
        \ of the questions I'm most often asked is: \"In what order would you recommend\
        \ reading these books?\" Unfortunately, I'm just exactly the wrong guy to\
        \ ask. I made every effort to write them so that they could be read in any\
        \ order. I am aware that, in some measure at least, I have failed (I certainly\
        \ wouldn't recommend starting with <i>Teckla</i>, for example), but the fact\
        \ that I was trying makes me incapable of giving an answer.\r\n    \r\n  \
        \  Many people whose opinion I respect believe publication order is best .\
        \ . . The choice, I daresay, is yours. In any case, I hope you enjoy them.\r\
        \n    \r\n    --Steven Brust, 1999, in the notes for <i>The Book of Jhereg</i></blockquote>The\
        \ books are numbered in publication order;  here is a rough guide to chronological\
        \ order:\r\n    \r\n        Taltos (1988)\r\n        Dragon (1998)\r\n   \
        \     Yendi (1984)\r\n        Tiassa, section 1 (2011)\r\n        Jhereg (1983)\r\
        \n        Teckla (1987)\r\n        Phoenix (1990)\r\n        Jhegaala (2008)\r\
        \n        Athyra (1993)\r\n        Orca (1996)\r\n        Issola (2001)\r\n\
        \        Dzur (2006)\r\n        Tiassa, section 2 (2011)\r\n        Iorich\
