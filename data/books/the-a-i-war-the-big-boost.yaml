description: The Long-Awaited Sequel to The Long Run and The Last Dancer.<br /><br
  />In 2072, the United Nations Space Force began building the Unity . . . at Halfway.<br
  /><br />The Unity was seven kilometers long. It was not merely the largest spacecraft
  that had ever been built, more than ten times as long as the uncrewed mining ferries
  that had, in calmer times, sent ore from the Belt to Halfway; it was nearly the
  largest artifact humans had ever built. There are cylindrical Cities in the Belt
  that are larger, blown up out of asteroids that were melted down with giant mirrors,
  and then inflated, while still molten metal, to the desired shape . . . but in 2080
  there are only a few, and even those few are not much larger than the Unity.<br
  /><br />She had been designed for one purpose, and though the Unification had never
  said so publicly, that purpose was the clearest thing in the System:<br /><br />Sixty
  years after the end of the Unification War, the Unification of Earth intended to
  become the Unification of Sol.
