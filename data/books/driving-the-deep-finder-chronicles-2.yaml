description: '<b>From a Hugo Award-winning author comes the second book in this action-packed
  sci-fi caper, starring Fergus Ferguson, interstellar repo man and professional finder.</b><br
  /><br />As a professional finder, Fergus Ferguson is hired to locate missing objects
  and steal them back. But it is rarely so simple, especially after his latest job
  in Cernee. He''s been recovering from that experience in the company of friends,
  the Shipmakers of Pluto, experts at crafting top-of-the-line AI spaceships.<br /><br
  />The Shipmakers have convinced Fergus to finally deal with unfinished business
  he''s been avoiding for half his life: Earth. Fergus hasn''t been back to his homeworld
  since he was fifteen, when he stole his cousin''s motorcycle and ran away. It was
  his first theft, and nothing he''s stolen since has been anywhere near so easy,
  or weighed so heavily on his conscience. Many years and many jobs later, Fergus
  reluctantly agrees that now is the time to return the motorcycle and face his family.<br
  /><br />Unfortunately, someone has gotten to the motorcycle before him. And before
  he can figure out where it went and why the storage unit that held it is now filled
  with priceless, stolen art, the Shipyard is attacked. His friends are missing, presumably
  kidnapped.<br /><br />Accompanied by an untrustworthy detective who suspects Fergus
  is the art thief and the sole friend who escaped the attack, Fergus must follow
  the tenuous clues to locate and save his friends. The trail leads them to Enceladus,
  where Fergus plans to go undercover to the research stations that lie beneath the
  moon''s thick ice sheet deep in a dark, oppressive ocean.<br /><br />But all movement
  and personnel are watched, and the limited ways through the thick ice of the moon''s
  surface are dangerous and highly monitored. Even if Fergus can manage to find proof
  that his friends are there and alive, getting out again is going to be a lot more
  complicated than he bargained for.'
