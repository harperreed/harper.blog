description: "<div>The Ghost Brigades are the Special Forces of the Colonial Defense\
  \ Forces, elite troops created from the DNA of the dead and turned into the perfect\
  \ soldiers for the CDF's toughest operations. They're young, they're fast and strong,\
  \ and they're totally without normal human qualms.<br /><br />The universe is a\
  \ dangerous place for humanity--and it's about to become far more dangerous. Three\
  \ races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our expansion into\
  \ space. Their linchpin: the turncoat military scientist Charles Boutin, who knows\
  \ the CDF's biggest military secrets. To prevail, the CDF must find out why Boutin\
  \ did what he did.<br /><br />Jared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers\
  \ -- a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin's DNA, Jared's brain should be able\
  \ to access Boutin's electronic memories. But when the memory transplant appears\
  \ to fail, Jared is given to the Ghost Brigades.<br /><br />At first, Jared is a\
  \ perfect soldier, but as Boutin's memories slowly surface, Jared begins to intuit\
  \ the reason's for Boutin's betrayal. As Jared desperately hunts for his \"father,\"\
  \ he must also come to grips with his own choices. Time is running out: The alliance\
  \ is preparing its offensive, and some of them plan worse things than humanity's\

      description: "<i>New York Times</i> bestselling author John Scalzi takes you\
        \ on an epic romp of galactic conquest and exploration in the Old Man's War\
        \ series. Humanity has reached the stars, but have been engaged in wars with\
        \ alien races for decades over habitable planets. The Colonial Defense Force\
        \ fights for Earth. To join the CDF, a recruit must have reached retirement\
        \ age. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge\
        \ and skills of decades of living. Soldiers are taken off Earth and never\
        \ allowed to return. They'll serve time at the front. And if they survive,\
        \ they'll be given a generous homestead on one of Earth's hard-won colony\
        \ planets.\n    \n    \n    Old Man\u2019s War, The Last Colony and Zoe\u2019\
        s Tale were each nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in their respective\
        \ years. Zoe\u2019s Tale was additionally nominated for the Andre Norton Award\
        \ for Best Young Adult Science Fiction/Fantasy. The Ghost Brigades was nominated\
        \ for the Prometheus Award. Old Man\u2019s War was the winner of the Geffen\
        \ Award in Israel; The Last Colony the recipient of the Seiun Award in Japan.\n\
        \    \n    Old Man\u2019s War was ranked #1 on the Tor.com reader poll of\
        \ the best science fiction and fantasy novels of 2000 \u2013 2010. It is listed\
        \ on the NPR.com reader poll of the Top 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy Books/Series."
