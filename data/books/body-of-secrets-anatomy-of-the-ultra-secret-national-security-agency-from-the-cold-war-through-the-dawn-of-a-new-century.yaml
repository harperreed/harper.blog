description: "The National Security Agency is the world\u2019s most powerful, most\
  \ far-reaching espionage. Now with a new afterword describing the security lapses\
  \ that preceded the attacks of September 11, 2001, <b>Body of Secrets</b> takes\
  \ us to the inner sanctum of America\u2019s spy world. In the follow-up to his bestselling\
  \ <i>Puzzle Palace</i>, James Banford reveals the NSA\u2019s hidden role in the\
  \ most volatile world events of the past, and its desperate scramble to meet the\
  \ frightening challenges of today and tomorrow.<br /><br />Here is a scrupulously\
  \ documented account\u2013much of which is based on unprecedented access to previously\
  \ undisclosed documents\u2013of the agency\u2019s tireless hunt for intelligence\
  \ on enemies and allies alike. Body of secrets is a riveting analysis of this most\
  \ clandestine of agencies, a major work of history and investigative journalism."
