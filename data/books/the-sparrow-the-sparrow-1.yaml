description: In 2019, humanity finally finds proof of extraterrestrial life when a
  listening post in Puerto Rico picks up exquisite singing from a planet that will
  come to be known as Rakhat. While United Nations diplomats endlessly debate a possible
  first contact mission, the Society of Jesus quietly organizes an eight-person scientific
  expedition of its own. What the Jesuits find is a world so beyond comprehension
  that it will lead them to question what it means to be "human".
