description: "Hugo Award winner Emma Newman returns to the captivating Planetfall\
  \ universe with a novel about vengeance, and a woman deciding if she can become\
  \ a murderer to save the future of humanity.<br /><br />Six months after she left\
  \ Earth, Dee is struggling to manage her rage toward the people who ordered the\
  \ nuclear strike that destroyed the world. She\u2019s trying to find those responsible,\
  \ and to understand why the ship is keeping everyone divided into small groups,\
  \ but she\u2019s not getting very far alone. <br />A dedicated gamer, she throws\
  \ herself into mersives to escape and is approached by a designer who asks her to\
  \ play test his new game. It isn\u2019t like any game she\u2019s played before.\
  \ Then a character she kills in the climax of the game turns out to bear a striking\
  \ resemblance to a man who dies suddenly in the real world at exactly the same time.\
  \ A man she discovers was one of those responsible for the death of millions on\
  \ Earth. <br />Disturbed, but thinking it must be a coincidence, Dee pulls back\
  \ from gaming and continues the hunt for information. But when she finds out the\
  \ true plans for the future colony, she realizes that to save what is left of humanity,\
  \ she may have to do something that risks losing her own."
