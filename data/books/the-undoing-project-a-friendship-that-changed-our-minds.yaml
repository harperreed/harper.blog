description: "Bestselling author Michael Lewis examines how a Nobel Prize\u2013winning\
  \ theory of the mind altered our perception of reality.<br /><br />Forty years ago,\
  \ Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky wrote a series of breathtakingly\
  \ original studies undoing our assumptions about the decision-making process. Their\
  \ papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced\
  \ to make judgments about uncertain situations. Their work created the field of\
  \ behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based\
  \ medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael\
  \ Lewis\u2019s own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than\
  \ anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms.<br\
  \ /><br />The Undoing Project is about the fascinating collaboration between two\
  \ men who have the dimensions of great literary figures. They became heroes in the\
  \ university and on the battlefield\u2015both had important careers in the Israeli\
  \ military\u2015and their research was deeply linked to their extraordinary life\
  \ experiences. In the process they may well have changed, for good, mankind\u2019\
  s view of its own mind."
