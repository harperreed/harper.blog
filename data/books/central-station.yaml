description: "A worldwide diaspora has left a quarter of a million people at the foot\
  \ of a space station. Cultures collide in real life and virtual reality. The city\
  \ is literally a weed, its growth left unchecked. Life is cheap, and data is cheaper.<br\
  \ /><br />When Boris Chong returns to Tel Aviv from Mars, much has changed. Boris\u2019\
  s ex-lover is raising a strangely familiar child who can tap into the datastream\
  \ of a mind with the touch of a finger. His cousin is infatuated with a robotnik\u2014\
  a damaged cyborg soldier who might as well be begging for parts. His father is terminally-ill\
  \ with a multigenerational mind-plague. And a hunted data-vampire has followed Boris\
  \ to where she is forbidden to return.<br /><br />Rising above them is Central Station,\
  \ the interplanetary hub between all things: the constantly shifting Tel Aviv; a\
  \ powerful virtual arena, and the space colonies where humanity has gone to escape\
  \ the ravages of poverty and war. Everything is connected by the Others, powerful\
  \ alien entities who, through the Conversation\u2014a shifting, flowing stream of\
  \ consciousness\u2014are just the beginning of irrevocable change.<br /><br />At\
  \ Central Station, humans and machines continue to adapt, thrive...and even evolve.<br\
  \ />"
