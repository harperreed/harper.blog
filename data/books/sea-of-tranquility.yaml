description: "<b>The award-winning, best-selling author of <i>Station Eleven</i> and\
  \ <i>The Glass Hotel</i> returns with a novel of art, time, love, and plague that\
  \ takes the reader from Vancouver Island in 1912 to a dark colony on the moon three\
  \ hundred years later, unfurling a story of humanity across centuries and space.</b><br\
  \ /><br />Edwin St. Andrew is eighteen years old when he crosses the Atlantic by\
  \ steamship, exiled from polite society following an ill-conceived diatribe at a\
  \ dinner party. He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness,\
  \ and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal\u2014\
  an experience that shocks him to his core.<br /><br />Two centuries later a famous\
  \ writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She\u2019s traveling all over\
  \ Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired\
  \ towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive\u2019s bestselling pandemic\
  \ novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing\
  \ corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him.<br /><br\
  \ />When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is\
  \ hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers\
  \ a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer\
  \ trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from\
  \ the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something\
  \ extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe.<br /><br />A virtuoso\
  \ performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, <i>Sea\
  \ of Tranquility</i> is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures\
  \ the reality of our current moment."
