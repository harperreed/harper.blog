description: '<div>Four time Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge has taken readers to the
  depths of space and into the far future in his bestselling novels <i>A Fire Upon
  the Deep</i> and <i>A Deepness in the Sky</i>. Now, he has written a science-fiction
  thriller set in a place and time as exciting and strange as any far-future world:
  San Diego, California, 2025.<br /><br />Robert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer''s patient.
  The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his
  faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he
  discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned
  poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much
  younger, and he''s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts
  . Living with his son''s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with
  a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum,
  layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending
  on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only
  if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless
  access--through nodes designed into <i>smart</i> clothes--and to see the digital
  context--through <i>smart</i> contact lenses. <br /><br />With knowledge comes risk.
  When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people
  what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes
  part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination.
  <br /><br />In a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in,
  this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts,
  including Robert''s son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military.
  And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the
  plot. <br /><br />As Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked
  to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books
  there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees
  feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world
  converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular
  moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected. This is science fiction at
  its very best, by a master storyteller at his peak.<br /></div>'
