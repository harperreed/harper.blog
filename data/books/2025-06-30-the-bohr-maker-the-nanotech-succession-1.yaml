description: Nikko is the first true "post human"-a man genetically engineered to
  survive in the airless void of space-but the research permit that allows his existence
  is about to expire. His body has already begun an insidious, pre-programmed failure
  that will end in his death. Nikko's only hope for survival rides on an illegal and
  extremely powerful nanotech device known as the Bohr Maker, that will allow him
  to rewrite his genetic code and extend his life. He attempts to steal the Maker
  from the archives of the Commonwealth police, but his plan goes awry. The device
  escapes into the wild, infecting a young woman named Phousita who lives in an impoverished
  slum where nanotechnology is regulated only by the black market. Phousita's genetic
  code is rewritten by the Maker. Her senses are enhanced, and she gains extraordinary
  powers of healing, but like Nikko she has become a fugitive. The Commonwealth police
  are on the hunt, determined to sterilize all traces of the Bohr Maker before it
  can be copied and spread throughout the population. Together, Phousita and Nikko
  must evade a ruthless pursuit, both to preserve their own lives and to save the
  Bohr Maker, which holds the promise of re-defining humanity-for good or for ill.A
  brilliantly original, fast-paced thriller, The Bohr Maker won the Locus Award for
  Best First Novel. The Bohr Maker is Book 1 of The Nanotech Succession, a collection
  of stand-alone novels exploring the rise of nanotechnology and the strange and fascinating
  future that follows.
