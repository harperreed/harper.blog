description: Newcago is free.<br /> They told David it was impossible, that even the
  Reckoners had never killed a High Epic. Yet Steelheart--invincible, immortal, unconquerable--is
  dead. And he died by David's hand.<br /> Eliminating Steelheart was supposed to
  make life simpler. Instead, it only made David realize he has questions. Big ones.
  And no one in Newcago can give him answers.<br /> Babylon Restored, the city formerly
  known as the borough of Manhattan, has possibilities, though. Ruled by the mysterious
  High Epic Regalia, Babylon Restored is flooded and miserable, but David is sure
  it's the path that will lead him to what he needs to find. Entering a city oppressed
  by a High Epic despot is risky, but David's willing to take the gamble. Because
  killing Steelheart left a hole in David's heart. A hole where his thirst for vengeance
  once lived. Somehow, he filled that hole with another Epic--Firefight. And now he
  will go on a quest darker and even more dangerous than the fight against Steelheart
  to find her, and to get his answers.
