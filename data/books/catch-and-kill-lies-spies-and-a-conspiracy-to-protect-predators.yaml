description: '<b>In a dramatic account of violence and espionage, Pulitzer Prize-winning
  investigative reporter Ronan Farrow exposes serial abusers and a cabal of powerful
  interests hellbent on covering up the truth, at any cost.</b><br /><br />In 2017,
  a routine network television investigation led Ronan Farrow to a story only whispered
  about: one of Hollywood''s most powerful producers was a predator, protected by
  fear, wealth, and a conspiracy of silence. As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy
  operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret
  campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move, and
  weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family. <br /><br />All the while, Farrow
  and his producer faced a degree of resistance that could not be explained--until
  now. And a trail of clues revealed corruption and cover-ups from Hollywood, to Washington,
  and beyond. <br /><br />This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance
  and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists,
  evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse--and it''s the story of the women
  who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement.<br /><br
  />Both a spy thriller and a meticulous work of investigative journalism, <i>Catch
  and Kill</i> breaks devastating new stories about the rampant abuse of power--and
  sheds far-reaching light on investigations that shook the culture.'
