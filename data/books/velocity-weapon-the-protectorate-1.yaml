  \ Greeve were siblings destined for greatness. A high-flying sergeant, Sanda has\
  \ the skills to take down any enemy combatant. Biran is a savvy politician who aims\
  \ to use his new political position to prevent conflict from escalating to total\
  \ destruction. </div>\n  <div>\n    <br />\n  </div>\n  <div>However, on a routine\
  \ maneuver, Sanda loses consciousness when her gunship is blown out of the sky.\
  \ Instead of finding herself in friendly hands, she awakens 230 years later on a\
  \ deserted enemy warship controlled by an AI who calls himself Bero. The war is\
  \ lost. The star system is dead. Ada Prime and its rival Icarion have wiped each\
  \ other from the universe.</div>\n  <div>\n    <br />\n  </div>\n  <div>Now, separated\
  \ by time and space, Sanda and Biran must fight to put things right. </div>\n</div><div>\n\
