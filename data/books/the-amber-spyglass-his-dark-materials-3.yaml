        \ by Philip Pullman consisting of Northern Lights (published as The Golden\
        \ Compass in North America), The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass. It\
        \ follows the coming of age of two children, Lyra Belacqua and Will Parry,\
        \ as they wander through a series of parallel universes.\r\n    \r\n    In\
