description: "<b>A vividly imagined fantasy of court intrigue and dark magics in a\
  \ steampunk-inflected world, by a brilliant young talent.</b><br /><br />The youngest,\
  \ half-goblin son of the Emperor has lived his entire life in exile, distant from\
  \ the Imperial Court and the deadly intrigue that suffuses it. But when his father\
  \ and three sons in line for the throne are killed in an \"accident,\" he has no\
  \ choice but to take his place as the only surviving rightful heir.<br /><br />Entirely\
  \ unschooled in the art of court politics, he has no friends, no advisors, and the\
  \ sure knowledge that whoever assassinated his father and brothers could make an\
  \ attempt on his life at any moment.<br /><br />Surrounded by sycophants eager to\
  \ curry favor with the na\xEFve new emperor, and overwhelmed by the burdens of his\
  \ new life, he can trust nobody. Amid the swirl of plots to depose him, offers of\
  \ arranged marriages, and the specter of the unknown conspirators who lurk in the\
  \ shadows, he must quickly adjust to life as the Goblin Emperor. All the while,\
  \ he is alone, and trying to find even a single friend... and hoping for the possibility\
  \ of romance, yet also vigilant against the unseen enemies that threaten him, lest\
  \ he lose his throne \u2013 or his life.<br /><br />This exciting fantasy novel,\
  \ set against the pageantry and color of a fascinating, unique world, is a memorable\
  \ debut for a great new talent."
