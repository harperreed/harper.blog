description: <i>Black Boy</i> is a classic of American autobiography, a subtly crafted
  narrative of Richard Wright's journey from innocence to experience in the Jim Crow
  South. An enduring story of one young man's coming of age during a particular time
  and place, <i>Black Boy</i> remains a seminal text in our history about what it
  means to be a man, black, and Southern in America.
