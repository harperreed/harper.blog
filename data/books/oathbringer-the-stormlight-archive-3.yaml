description: "<p>In <i>Oathbringer</i> humanity faces a new Desolation with the return\
  \ of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance.</p><p>Dalinar\
  \ Kholin\u2019s Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy\
  \ Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction,\
  \ and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror\
  \ of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to\
  \ warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the\
  \ fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.</p><p>Nestled\
  \ in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan\
  \ Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant\
  \ and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his\
  \ holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless\
  \ all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar\u2019s blood-soaked past and stand\
  \ together\u2014and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past\u2014even the\
  \ restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.</p>"

      description: "\n\n    Brandon Sanderson's epic fantasy cycle tells the story\
        \ of Roshar, a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power\
        \ sweep across the rocky terrain. It has been centuries since the fall of\
        \ the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades\
        \ and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform\
        \ ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. As brutal wars rage over the\
        \ control of these magical weapons, an ancient text called The Way of Kings\
        \ tells of ancient times, the Knights Radiant, and perhaps the true cause\
        \ of the war. The Knights Radiant must stand again.\r\n    \r\n    https://us.macmillan.com/series/thestormlightarchive\r\
        \n    \r\n    #0.5, <I>The Way of Kings Prime</I>, was written in 2002 and\
        \ is basically an alternate version of <I>The Way of Kings</I>, which was\
        \ published by Tor Books in 2010. <I>The Way of Kings Prime</I> is very different\
        \ from the published book. Think of it as set in a different universe with\
        \ a completely different plot. <B>If you haven\u2019t read the 2010 canonical\
        \ version, please read that one first.</B> -- from author's website (emphasis\
        \ mine)\r\n    \r\n    One novel set in this world is the short story \"Rysn\"\
        \ from the anthology Epic - Legends of Fantasy. \r\n    \r\n    The Stormlight\
        \ Archive series will have 10 books: first five books will form first part\
        \ sequence, while other five books will form the second part of the series.\r\
