description: "Mycroft Canner is a convict. For his crimes he is required, as is the\
  \ custom of the 25th century, to wander the world being as useful as he can to all\
  \ he meets. Carlyle Foster is a sensayer\u2014a spiritual counselor in a world that\
  \ has outlawed the public practice of religion, but which also knows that the inner\
  \ lives of humans cannot be wished away.<br /><br />The world into which Mycroft\
  \ and Carlyle have been born is as strange to our 21st-century eyes as ours would\
  \ be to a native of the 1500s. It is a hard-won utopia built on technologically-generated\
  \ abundance, and also on complex and mandatory systems of labelling all public writing\
  \ and speech. What seem to us normal gender distinctions are now distinctly taboo\
  \ in most social situations. And most of the world's population is affiliated with\
  \ globe-girdling clans of the like-minded, whose endless economic and cultural competition\
  \ is carefully managed by central planners of inestimable subtlety. To us it seems\
  \ like a mad combination of heaven and hell. To them, it seems like normal life.<br\
  \ /><br />And in this world, Mycroft and Carlyle have stumbled on the wild card\
  \ that may destablize the system: the boy Bridger, who can effortlessly make his\
  \ wishes come true. Who can, it would seem, bring inanimate objects to life..."
