description: '"I''m a fabulist by trade," warns Gabriel Noone, a late-night radio
  storyteller, as he begins to untangle the skeins of his tumultuous life: his crumbling
  ten-year love affair, his disaffection from his Southern father, his longtime weakness
  for ignoring reality. Gabriel''s most sympathetic listener is Pete Lomax, a thirteen-year-old
  fan in Wisconsin whose own horrific past has left him wise and generous beyond his
  years. But when this virtual father-son relationship is rocked by doubt, a desperate
  search for the truth ensues. Welcome to the complex, vertiginous world of <em>The
  Night Listener</em>.'
