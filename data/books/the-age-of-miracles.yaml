description: "\u201CIt\u2019s never the disasters you see coming that finally come\
  \ to pass\u2014it\u2019s the ones you don\u2019t expect at all,\u201D says Julia,\
  \ in this spellbinding novel of catastrophe and survival by a superb new writer.\
  \ Luminous, suspenseful, unforgettable, <i>The Age of Miracles</i> tells the haunting\
  \ and beautiful story of Julia and her family as they struggle to live in a time\
  \ of extraordinary change.<br /> \_<br /> On an ordinary Saturday in a California\
  \ suburb, Julia awakens to discover that something has happened to the rotation\
  \ of the earth. The days and nights are growing longer and longer; gravity is affected;\
  \ the birds, the tides, human behavior, and cosmic rhythms are thrown into disarray.\
  \ In a world that seems filled with danger and loss, Julia also must face surprising\
  \ developments in herself, and in her personal world: divisions widening between\
  \ her parents; strange behavior by her friends; the pain and vulnerability of first\
  \ love; a growing sense of isolation; and a surprising, rebellious new strength.\
  \ With crystalline prose and the indelible magic of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson\
  \ Walker paints a breathtaking portrait of people finding ways to go on in an ever-evolving\
  \ world."
