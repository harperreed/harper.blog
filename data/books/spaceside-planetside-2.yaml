description: "<strong>\n  <em>A military legend is caught in the web between alien\
  \ intrigue and human subterfuge\u2026</em>\n</strong><br /><br />Following his mission\
  \ on Cappa, Colonel Carl Butler returns to a mixed reception. To some he is a do-or-die\
  \ war hero. To the other half of the galaxy he\u2019s a pariah. Forced into retirement,\
  \ he has resettled on Talca Four where he\u2019s now Deputy VP of Corporate Security,\
  \ protecting a high-tech military company on the corporate battlefield\u2014at least,\
  \ that\u2019s what the job description says. Really, he\u2019s just there to impress\
  \ clients and investors. It\u2019s all relatively low risk\u2014until he\u2019s\
  \ entrusted with new orders. A breach of a competitor\u2019s computer network has\
  \ Butler\u2019s superiors feeling every bit as vulnerable. They need Butler to find\
  \ who did it, how, and why no one\u2019s taken credit for the ingenious attack.<br\
  \ /><br />As accustomed as Butler is to the reality of wargames\u2014virtual and\
  \ otherwise\u2014this one screams something louder than a simple hack. Because no\
  \ sooner does he start digging when his first contact is murdered, the death somehow\
  \ kept secret from the media. As a prime suspect, he can\u2019t shake the sensation\
  \ he\u2019s being watched\u2026or finally succumbing to the stress of his past.\
  \ Paranoid delusion or dangerous reality, Butler might be onto something much deeper\
  \ than anyone imagined. But that\u2019s where Butler thrives.<br /><br />If he hasn\u2019\
  t signed his own death warrant."
