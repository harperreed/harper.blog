description: "The Stunning and Emotional Autobiography of an Auschwitz Survivor<br\
  \ /><br />April 7, 1944\u2014This date marks the successful escape of two Slovak\
  \ prisoners from one of the most heavily-guarded and notorious concentration camps\
  \ of Nazi Germany. The escapees, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, fled over one hundred\
  \ miles to be the first to give the graphic and detailed descriptions of the atrocities\
  \ of Auschwitz.<br /><br />Originally published in the early 1960s, I Escaped from\
  \ Auschwitz is the striking autobiography of none other than Rudolf Vrba himself.\
  \ Vrba details his life leading up to, during, and after his escape from his 21-month\
  \ internment in Auschwitz. Vrba and Wetzler manage to evade Nazi authorities looking\
  \ for them and make contact with the Jewish council in Zilina, Slovakia, informing\
  \ them about the truth of the \u201Cunknown destination\u201D of Jewish deportees\
  \ all across Europe. This first-hand report alerted Western authorities, such as\
  \ Pope Pius XII, Winston Churchill, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, to the reality of\
  \ Nazi annihilation camps\u2014information that until then had only been recognized\
  \ as nasty rumors.<br /><br />I Escaped from Auschwitz is a close-up look at the\
  \ horror faced by the Jewish people in Auschwitz and across Europe during World\
  \ War II. This newly edited translation of Vrba\u2019s memoir will leave readers\
  \ reeling at the terrors faced by those during the Holocaust. Despite the profound\
  \ emotions brought about by this narrative, readers will also find an astounding\
  \ story of heroism and courage in the face of seemingly hopeless circumstances."
