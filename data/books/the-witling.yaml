description: This second novel by multiple award-winner Vernor Vinge, from 1976, is
  a fast-paced adventure where galactic policies collide and different cultures clash
  as two scientists and their faith in technology are pitted against an elusive race
  of telekinetic beings.<br /><br />Marooned on a distant world and slowly dying of
  food poisoning, two anthropologists are caught between warring alien factions engaged
  in a battle that will affect the future of the world's inhabitants and their deadly
  telekinetic powers. If the anthropologists can't help resolve the conflict between
  the feuding alien factions, no one will survive.<br /><br />This edition features
  sixteen full-page illustrations by Doug Beekman.
