description: "The Founding Fathers tried to protect us from the threat they knew,\
  \ the tyranny that overcame ancient democracy. Today, our political order faces\
  \ new threats, not unlike the totalitarianism of the twentieth century. We are no\
  \ wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism.\
  \ Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience.<br /><br /><i>On\
  \ Tyranny</i>\_is a call to arms and a guide to resistance, with invaluable ideas\
  \ for how we can preserve our freedoms in the uncertain years to come."
