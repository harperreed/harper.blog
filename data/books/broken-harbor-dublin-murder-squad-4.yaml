description: "<b></b>The mesmerizing fourth novel of the Dublin murder squad by <i>New\
  \ York Times</i> bestselling author Tana French<br /><br />Mick \"Scorcher\" Kennedy,\
  \ the brash cop from Tana French\u2019s bestselling <i>Faithful Place</i>, plays\
  \ by the book and plays hard. That\u2019s what\u2019s made him the Murder squad\u2019\
  s top detective\u2014and that\u2019s what puts the biggest case of the year into\
  \ his hands.<br /><br />On one of the half-built, half-abandoned \"luxury\" developments\
  \ that litter Ireland, Patrick Spain and his two young children are dead. His wife,\
  \ Jenny, is in intensive care.<br /><br />At first, Scorcher and his rookie partner,\
  \ Richie, think it\u2019s going to be an easy solve. But too many small things can\u2019\
  t be explained. The half dozen baby monitors, their cameras pointing at holes smashed\
  \ in the Spains\u2019 walls. The files erased from the Spains\u2019 computer. The\
  \ story Jenny told her sister about a shadowy intruder who was slipping past all\
  \ the locks.<br /><br />And Broken Harbor holds memories for Scorcher. Seeing the\
  \ case on the news sends his sister Dina off the rails again, and she\u2019s resurrecting\
  \ something that Scorcher thought he had tightly under control: what happened to\
  \ their family one summer at Broken Harbor, back when they were children.<br /><br\
  \ />With her signature blend of police procedural and psychological thriller, French\u2019\
  s new novel goes full throttle with a heinous crime, creating her most complicated\
  \ detective character and her best book yet."
