description: "<i>\u201CI seen a kid killed\u2026He strangled it, up by the horse.\u201D\
  </i><br /><br />When Billy, a troubled young man, comes to private eye Cormoran\
  \ Strike\u2019s office to ask for his help investigating a crime he thinks he witnessed\
  \ as a child, Strike is left deeply unsettled. While Billy is obviously mentally\
  \ distressed, and cannot remember many concrete details, there is something sincere\
  \ about him and his story. But before Strike can question him further, Billy bolts\
  \ from his office in a panic.<br /><br />Trying to get to the bottom of Billy\u2019\
  s story, Strike and Robin Ellacott\u2014once his assistant, now a partner in the\
  \ agency\u2014set off on a twisting trail that leads them through the backstreets\
  \ of London, into a secretive inner sanctum within Parliament, and to a beautiful\
  \ but sinister manor house deep in the countryside.<br /><br />And during this labyrinthine\
  \ investigation, Strike\u2019s own life is far from straightforward: his newfound\
  \ fame as a private eye means he can no longer operate behind the scenes as he once\
  \ did. Plus, his relationship with his former assistant is more fraught than it\
  \ ever has been\u2014Robin is now invaluable to Strike in the business, but their\
  \ personal relationship is much, much trickier than that."
