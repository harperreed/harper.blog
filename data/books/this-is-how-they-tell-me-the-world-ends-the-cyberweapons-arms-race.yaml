description: '<b>From<i> The New York Times </i>cybersecurity reporter Nicole Perlroth,
  the untold story of the cyberweapons market-the most secretive, invisible, government-backed
  market on earth-and a terrifying first look at a new kind of global warfare.</b><br
  /><br />Zero day: a software bug that allows a hacker to break into your devices
  and move around undetected. One of the most coveted tools in a spy''s arsenal, a
  zero day has the power to silently spy on your iPhone, dismantle the safety controls
  at a chemical plant, alter an election, and shut down the electric grid (just ask
  Ukraine).<br /><br />For decades, under cover of classification levels and non-disclosure
  agreements, the United States government became the world''s dominant hoarder of
  zero days. U.S. government agents paid top dollar-first thousands, and later millions
  of dollars- to hackers willing to sell their lock-picking code and their silence.
  <br /><br />Then the United States lost control of its hoard <i>and</i> the market.
  <br /><br />Now those zero days are in the hands of hostile nations and mercenaries
  who do not care if your vote goes missing, your clean water is contaminated, or
  our nuclear plants melt down.<br /><br />Filled with spies, hackers, arms dealers,
  and a few unsung heroes, written like a thriller and a reference, <i>This Is How
  They Tell Me the World Ends</i> is an astonishing feat of journalism. Based on years
  of reporting and hundreds of interviews, <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> reporter
  Nicole Perlroth lifts the curtain on a market in shadow, revealing the urgent threat
  faced by us all if we cannot bring the global cyber arms race to heel.'
