description: "Ruthless and supremely powerful, the Great Library is now a presence\
  \ in every major city, governing the flow of knowledge to the masses. Alchemy allows\
  \ the Library to deliver the content of the greatest works of history instantly\u2014\
  but the personal ownership of books is expressly forbidden.<br /><br />Jess Brightwell\
  \ believes in the value of the Library, but the majority of his knowledge comes\
  \ from illegal books obtained by his family, who are involved in the thriving black\
  \ market. Jess has been sent to be his family\u2019s spy, but his loyalties are\
  \ tested in the final months of his training to enter the Library\u2019s service.<br\
  \ /><br />When his friend inadvertently commits heresy by creating a device that\
  \ could change the world, Jess discovers that those who control the Great Library\
  \ believe that knowledge is more valuable than any human life\u2014and soon both\
  \ heretics and books will burn\u2026"
