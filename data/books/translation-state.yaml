description: "The mystery of a missing translator sets three lives on a collision\
  \ course that will have a ripple effect across galaxies in this powerful new novel\
  \ by one of the masters of modern science fiction. <i>Translation State\_</i>is\
  \ at once a sweeping space adventure and a brilliant exploration of how in order\
  \ to belong, we must first become.<br /><br /> When Enae's grandmaman passes away,\
  \ Enae inherits something entirely unexpected: a diplomatic assignment to track\
  \ down a fugitive who has been missing for over 200 years. No one actually expects\
  \ Enae to succeed; it's an empty assignment meant to keep hir occupied. But Enae\
  \ has never had a true purpose\u2014no one ever expected hir to do more than care\
  \ for grandmaman\u2014so sie is determined to accomplish this task to the best of\
  \ hir ability.<br /><br /> Reet knows nothing about his biological family. He loves\
  \ his adoptive parents, but has always secretly yearned to understand his identity,\
  \ the roots that would explain why he seems to operate just a bit differently. After\
  \ all, no one else hungers to study the world by ripping it apart, by slicing into\
  \ those around them in order to make sense of things. So when a political group\
  \ approaches him with the claim that he has ties to a genetically mysterious, long-deceased\
  \ family, Reet is only too eager to believe them.<br /><br /> Qven was created to\
  \ be a Presgr translator. The pride of their Clade, they always had a clear path\
  \ before them: learn human ways, and eventually, make a match and serve as an intermediary\
  \ between the dangerous alien Presgr and the human worlds. The realization that\
  \ they might want something different isn't \"optimal behavior\". It's the type\
  \ of behavior that will have you eliminated. But Qven rebels anyway, determined\
  \ to find a way to belong on their own terms.<br /><br /> As a Conclave of the various\
  \ species approaches\u2014and the long-standing treaty between the humans and the\
  \ Presgr is on the line\u2014the paths of all three will collide in\_a chain of\
  \ events that will have ripple effects across galaxies."
