description: "<b>What if you once had thousands of bodies and near god-like technology\
  \ at your disposal? </b><br /><br /><b>And what if all of it were ripped away? </b><br\
  \ /><br />The Lord of the Radch has given Breq command of the ship <i>Mercy of Kalr</i>\
  \ and sent her to the only place she would have agreed to go\u2014to Athoek Station,\
  \ where Lieutenant Awn's sister works in Horticulture.<br /><br />Athoek was annexed\
  \ some six hundred years ago, and by now everyone is fully civilized\u2014or should\
  \ be. But everything is not as tranquil as it appears. Old divisions are still troublesome,\
  \ Athoek Station's AI is unhappy with the situation, and it looks like the alien\
  \ Presger might have taken an interest in what's going on. With no guarantees that\
  \ interest is benevolent."
