i am supposed to go juggle with matiss. <br/>
however. I lost matiss. <br/>
where is he. <br/><br/>

The dog I grew up with is really sick aand being put to sleep right now. it is pretty sad. she was old. and she was a good dog. <Br><br/>last night was fun. it was a good friday. I hung out with hiromi, claudia, felix and felix's crew. we went to crobar and chilled. it was nice. I drank a little bit of alcohol and then went home and slept. it was/is hot in our apt. <Br><br/>i gotta shower.<br/>wake up or whatever.<br/><br/>there are still certain parts of "this" that I hate.
