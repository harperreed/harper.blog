I am sleepy<br/>
I should have gone to bed sooner. It is now really late. I have a strange urge to listen to death metal constantly. I hope to get my hair cut soon. I like getting my hair cut. It is a nice thing to have happen. I wish I wasn't sleepy and sick.. and going to be more sick.. because I would be happier.. 
<br/>I have a problem of hittin gthe space bar too quickly. I am too fast for my own fingers. I also have a house full of japanese women. and a bag full of new yorkers. oh.. check out <a href="http://www.dopeman.org/ads">this</a> and tell me which is best...
