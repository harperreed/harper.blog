A bunch of friends have asked for my climate fiction reading list. Here it is:

1. [A Children's Bible](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZTTH5VD?tag=harperrules0d-20) by [Lydia Millet](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dbooks&field-keywords=Lydia%20Millet&tag=harperrules0d-20)
2. [Crossed](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010EO3A3K?tag=harperrules0d-20) by [Evelyn Blackwell](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dbooks&field-keywords=Evelyn%20Blackwell&tag=harperrules0d-20)
3. [The Deluge](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3Y91YDR?tag=harperrules0d-20) by [Stephen Markley](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dbooks&field-keywords=Stephen%20Markley&tag=harperrules0d-20)
4. [American War](https://reading.lol/books/american-war/) by [Omar El Akkad](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dbooks&field-keywords=Omar%20El%20Akkad&tag=harperrules0d-20)
5. [Denial](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JPJF5B1?tag=harperrules0d-20) by [Jon Raymond](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dbooks&field-keywords=Jon%20Raymond&tag=harperrules0d-20)

Extra credit

- [Delta-v series](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dbooks&field-keywords=Delta+V+Suarez&tag=harperrules0d-20) by [Daniel Suarez](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dbooks&field-keywords=Daniel%20Suarez&tag=harperrules0d-20)
- [Ministry of the Future](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084FY1NXB?tag=harperrules0d-20) by [Kim Stanley Robinso](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dbooks&field-keywords=Kim%20Stanley%20Robinson&tag=harperrules0d-20)
- [Radicalized](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HWY7XG8?tag=harperrules0d-20) by [Cory Doctorow](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dbooks&field-keywords=Cory%20Doctorow&tag=harperrules0d-20)

If you only read one, read The Deluge. If only two, than The Deluge + American War. I think the first 5 paint a rather accurate picture of what could be coming for us all. Deprioritize Ministry of the Future. Delta-v is fun.

Let me know how it goes.
