The translation began with a straightforward render of the source material into Mandarin under a detailed system prompt: preserve formatting and markdown, leave code‐ and block-quoted text untouched, and aim for fluid, idiomatic Chinese. The raw output already captured most of the structure—headings, links, image embeds—while converting prose and colloquialisms into reasonably natural Mandarin.

Next came a multi-stage critique and editing cycle. An editor prompt instructed a side-by-side review, asking for fluency adjustments, grammar corrections, and tighter idiomatic rendering without altering meaning or structure. Four critique loops then dug deeper:

• Critique 1 pointed out “hell of a lot more expensive” was under-translated, recommended stronger expressions (“贵得离谱”) and flagged serious semantic shifts (e.g. “My family is dying.” becoming “揭不开锅”), suggesting more faithful intensity.  
• Critique 2 broadened the scope: it didn’t just check tone but audited every heading, alt text, date, and technical term, noting where the original camera model was dropped or dates altered. It organized problems by severity—from outright errors to style inconsistencies—offering targeted fixes.  
• Subsequent critiques focused on smaller but pervasive issues: inconsistent terminology, missing punctuation nuances, and markdown edge cases (extra spaces, malformed tags). They also called out places where literal translation backslid into awkward phrasing, nudging the translator toward a more native feel.  
• By loop four, the priority was polish—smoothing out any remaining stiff sentences, rebalancing formal vs. conversational tone, and ensuring all technical jargon (like “codegen”) was either correctly localized or clearly left in English.

Throughout, each pass layered on improvement without disrupting the overall structure. Early loops addressed “big-ticket” meaning and tone, while later ones tackled house-keeping: formatting, punctuation, and consistency. The result is a translation that reads as if authored natively—complete with natural idioms, intact technical references, and faithful formatting—yet remains technically accurate and true to the original intent.

Overall, this four-loop critique workflow proved effective. By separating major corrections from fine-tuning, it balanced fidelity with readability. Challenges around idiomatic strength, precise metadata transfer, and markdown preservation were systematically resolved, yielding a polished final text that maintains both the spirit and the structure of the source.
