title: 'Me on The Setup: Harper Reed uses this.'
---

###Preface

I have been following [The Setup](http://usesthis.com) for quite awhile. I love learning about the **how**, **why** and **what** of getting things done. The Setup does such a great job of shifting the dialog to the objects that are behind the action. 

So, as a long time reader, I was stoked when Daniel (aka [waferbaby](http://waferbaby.com)) reached out and asked if I would like to do an interview. 

Although I have included it here, please [check it out](http://harper.reed.usesthis.com/) on [The Setup](http://usesthis.com).

#My interview for [The Setup](http://usesthis.com)



####Who are you, and what do you do? (Try to keep this brief!)

I am [Harper Reed](http://harperreed.org). I make things happen on the internet. I am a connector and a technologist. I like to meld both of those things together to connect people to one another and enable them to build amazing technology. In the past I spent a bunch of time helping [Threadless](http://threadless.com) grow, then I helped [startups](http://www.sandboxindustries.com/) in Chicago [grow](http://www.exceleratelabs.com/), and now I am helping [reelect the president](http://barackobama.com). 

####What hardware are you using?

I typically have two workstations that I keep in sync via [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/). In the past, I have relied on a trusty [Lenovo X series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#X_series) laptop running [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) that I carry with me and then a workstation at home that is some form of macbook pro/mac mini. I used this setup for many years and loved it. Recently, because I fell in love with the [Macbook Air form factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air#Design), I migrated away from the lenovo and ubuntu in favor of a tiny happy [11" Macbook Air (i7)](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP631). It works well. For my desktop workstation I am using a late-model [Mac Mini (i7)](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP632) paired with a [Samsung SyncMaster 2343 monitor](http://www.samsung.com/ph/consumer/monitor-peripherals-printer/monitor/lcd-monitor/LS23MYZKFNA/XP/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail). It looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my desk. 

I obsess about bags. My daily driver is an [black on black Chrome Buran bag](https://www.chromebagsstore.com/bags/laptop-bags/buran.html). It is a very good bag. It isn't too fancy or clever. It just works. I sometimes travel using an [EOD mini utility bag](http://countycomm.com/minebag.html). It fits my air, power cord and a change of clothes. Recently a friend picked up a [Defy Urban Cowboy bag](http://defybags.com/urban-cowboy.html). It has an amazing buckle and fits the air perfectly.  Inside of these bags, my air lives in its own [Pack and Smooch](http://www.etsy.com/shop/packandsmooch) [Hampshire pouch](http://www.etsy.com/listing/62891440/11-inch-macbook-air-sleeve-hampshire-lts). It is felt and leather and was designed to not scratch up your air. Looks great too.

In my bag, I have a few organizational aids. I wrap up my Air power cord using the [Quirky PowerCurl](http://www.quirky.com/products/15-PowerCurl-Mac-Cord-Manager) (I love it because it is handy and [crowdsourced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing)). I keep a lot of miscellaneous cords, and whatnot in a [Klein Tools canvas utility bag](http://www.service.kleintools.com/Tools/PRD/Category/Zipper%20Bag%20-%20Canvas%20TOOLBAGS-CANVASTLBG-ZIPPERCNVS/Product/5139). It is handy to have a bag in my main bag to stuff things that will normally get lost.

At work I listen to a pair of [AiAiAi TMA-1](http://www.aiaiai.dk/store/headphones/tma-1) powered by a [candy tin headphone amp](http://www.ebay.com/sch/juice2214/m.html?_nkw=&_armrs=1&_from=&_ipg=&_trksid=p3686#ptm250917156510). At home I listen to a pair of [Grado sr60i](http://www.gradolabs.com/page_headphones.php?item=f4ba8830232696b5f580bd531134b668). I find that the Grado  headphones are quite noisy for people around me compared to the TMA-1s. Both are fine. I carry in my bag a pair of [Shure SE115 earphones](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones-headphones/se-models/se115-sound-isolating-earphones) for use when commuting or flying.

For a mobile comminucations, my primary device is a [iPhone 4S](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone_4s). I use Sprint for the carrier so that I can take advantage of the [Sprint/Google Voice integration](http://www.google.com/googlevoice/sprint/).  This enables me to switch between my android phone (a well used [Nexus S](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_S) on T-mobile) and my iPhone whenever I feel like it.  The iPhone is an amazing device. The camera is outstanding, the app ecosystem is great, the OS is frustrating. ;)

I aggressively use my [Kindle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle). I am a [voracious reader](http://harperreed.org/books) and the kindle is my constant companion on the quest to consume as many books as possible. The kindle has been a magical device for me. Besides being able to instantly start new books, I love how single purpose the kindle is. It makes it very easy to read books (as it should). I imagine that it will eventually become the [Young Lady's Illustrated Primer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age) that I want so badly. Until then, it will be my book consuming machine. 

A quick note on Kindles: I have owned the suite of Kindle devices. The best kindle they have made is the [Kindle 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle) (also known as the cheap kindle). After using the [Aztec Kindle](https://twitter.com/#!/zachklein/status/1192280043), the various Kindles with keyboards and finally the Kindle touch - I find that I am able to be a happier and more efficient reader with the cheaper kindle.


####And what software?

I try and keep a pretty simple software catalog. I don't want too many apps clogging my various tubes. 

To browse the interwebs, I use [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome). I edit all sorts of documents with [Vi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) (I really like [MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/) + [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) on OSX). I use iTunes to listen to locally stored music. I use [ichat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichat)/[adium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adium) (on OSX) or [Gajim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gajim) (ubuntu) for messaging; for IRC, I use  [Scrollz](http://www.scrollz.com/) (inside [screen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) (thinking about migrating to [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)) on a shell). I use whatever generic terminal is available for my shells. To make my shell experience on OSX bearable, I use [homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) (I shudder to think how things used to be on OSX). I use [dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) and [git](http://git-scm.com/) to keep things wrapped together. I have been experimenting with keeping my data in [encrypted sparse bundles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_image#Sparse_bundle) stored in git/dropbox.

Inside the browser I use a bunch of software to get things done. I rely on [Google Apps](http://google.com/a/) for a lot (mail, docs, collaboration, sms, voice, etc).  I use [simple note](http://simplenoteapp.com) to keep track of random thoughts on my phone. 

I love and use [github](http://github.com). I was not a git convert at first, but github made sharing code and working collaboratively better than ever. It is an amazing tool. I now use git everyday and it has made me a better developer and collaborator. 

For some strange reason, I use both [Amazon Cloudplayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Cloud_Drive#Cloud_Player) and [Google Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Beta_by_Google). They are functionally almost exactly the same and I have similar music collections on both. I switch arbitrarily between them. I purchase most of my music from [Amazon MP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_MP3). I also listen to [RDIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio) when I am lazy. I listen to [hype machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hype_Machine) more often than I should. 

One of my favorite killer apps is [partychat](http://partycapp.appspot.com). It is an [open source](https://code.google.com/p/partychapp/) jabber based persistent chat room. It works with google talk and is VERY simple. I use this to communicate with small groups of friends/collaborators. It has allowed [us](http://kntd.us) to collaborate on some amazing things. 


####What would be your dream setup?

I am lucky and am pretty happy with my current setup. I would easily add faster internet, more memory, smaller devices, better battery life and more general device convergence. also the [singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity). 

My dream setup from when I was in high school is more interesting. I spent hours drooling over the advertisements in the back of [Computer Shopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Shopper_(US_magazine) planning for this very question. For the processor, I wanted a [486 DX2 66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486DX2). I needed enough RAM to run [OS/2 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2) well (not warp!). To support the advanced graphics that OS/2 demanded, I wanted a [number nine GXE 64 graphics card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Nine_Visual_Technology#Number_Nine_Video_Cards_using_S3_Graphics_Processors). I desperately wanted a [Sound Blaster AWE64 sound card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_AWE64) to play [mods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file) and [id games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software). I also needed a crazy [ZyXEL 14.4 Modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZyXEL#Products) to dial into my local telnet drops and BBSes. The eventual goal was to triple boot [Slackware Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware) (sooo many disks), OS/2 and windows 95. At some point around '94 I achieved most of this, however OS/2 had faded away as a priority and I spent most of my time in Linux (thank goodness).
