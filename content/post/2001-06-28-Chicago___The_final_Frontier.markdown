WhooHoo
So i am in chicago now. It is noce. I have a rather bomb apartment. All <a href="http://www.x10.com">x10'd</a> out. Its nice. I am still dating th elovely and magnificant K*STar. It is wonderful. My job is working out well - i wish i made more money.. hehe.. 
I had to buy a new monitor, damn.. a 19" one at that.. heh.. its nice however. things are going well. i am lonly sometimes. cuz i have not as many ready-made friends as i have had in the past. well.. i hope it all stays as nice as it is now.. peace
