One you lock the target,<br/>
Two you bait the line,<br/>
Three you slowly spread the net<br/>
And four you catch the man!<br/><br/>

i am maybe drunk. it sucks. cuz I have to work. I thought I didn't have to work. and now I do. I am not real drunk. but a little. LAME. stupid sake. ;) <br/><br/>

i am in trouble. so much trouble. I need to figure out what is happening. figure out and make a couple decisions. I am scared and yet also happy. I could be sad. but I am not.<br/><br/>
