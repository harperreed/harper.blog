I upgraded to wordpress 2.0. easy as pie. really. quite easy. hopefully it just works from now on. it took about.. umm.. lets see.. including this blog post: 3min. haha. i love it when things just work.

I have been working quite a bit on <a href="http://www.extratasty.com">extratasty</a>. it is dope.  it is getting a quite <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/0e457218e9069733b6ad7497a6ea9ade">good reception on the ole intraweb</a>. I am happy for that.

ok. back to work.
