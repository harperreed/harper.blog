title: "What have I been up to? "

2020 has been a real motherfucker of a year (and it isn't even over!). Like everyone (and especially those of us in the U.S.), I have spent a lot of this year try to understand my place in this new world. I left PayPal in 2018 with the idea of figuring out what was next. I had a simple plan and early in 2020 it seemed that I was on the track of something exciting and big. Then COVID-19 hit. Everything stopped! 

I spent the first couple of weeks reeling like most folks. Then I got to work. 

Many folks have been asking me, "**What have you been up to?**" I never have the right answer. I write this as a way of answering that question in a very quick and robust way.

# Harper's COVID-19 work

Over the past several months, I have been doing a lot of work around COVID-19. Most of it has been around community organizing, tech enablement, or privacy. Here is a light summary of what I have been up to since mid-January. I created this list as a useful way to remember what I am doing. It has been helpful to describe the COVID-19 work that I have done. 

Here is what I have been up to since the beginning of the year (2020). 

(Would love chat about any of this stuff - so feel free to [send me an email ](mailto:harper@modest.com))

## Communities I started

The basis for my career and one of the things I find most powerful is community. COVID-19 was no different. What was different, though, was the venue. Most of the communities I started existed first on WhatsApp and then spun off into other platforms. WhatsApp (although owned by facebook - big downside) is very good for group messaging. It is fast, light, and easy to use. More importantly, it is international. When I started, most of these communities were primarily global communities. 

My friend, Tricia Wang, descibed this best in her piece about [Chinese COVID-19 communities on WeChat](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/triciawang/a-lesson-from-the-people-of-wuhan-community-hyper-local). The online Chinese communities did this well before we did. 

### COVID-1919: real info only (active)
- Created: 1/21/2020
- Population: 133
    
The O.G. of chat groups. A group of scientists, doctors, epidemiologists, data folks, and hackers focused on the science part of COVID-19. It was started relatively early in the year (before COVID-19 was COVID-19) and thus the focus on "real info only" (as coined by Dr. Jordan Shlain). 

### Clinicians community (active)
- Created: 3/13/2020
- Population: 114

Dr. Jordan Shlain pitched an idea to make a copy of the "real info only" group but only be clinicians. The idea was that anyone could watch, but only clinicians could talk. It was entirely self-policed and worked out really well. A lot of amazing people participated in that community. 

### Sourcing PPE community (Ended) (success)
- Created: 3/19/2020
- Population: 175
- Supply chains have come back (For the most part)

When the supply chain broke down in the U.S., I splintered a few folks from the main channel, and we started thinking through how to source PPE, etc. It was a success. Eventually, it ended up dying out - but not before a handful of really fantastic orgs spun out - including the Last Mile. 

### DIY PPE/Equipment community (dead) (success)
- Created: 3/28/2020
- Population: 95
- Supply chains have come back. 

Very similar to the other PPE channel - but more focused on the DIY side. A lot of talk about ventilators and baking N95 masks. 

### Data Science community (dead)
- Created: 3/11/2020
- Population: 44

The data side. Many work around visualizing hotspots from mobile phone carrier data, and some work around modeling COVID-19. It was a shorter-lived community, but we had a lot of fun trying to solve some big problems.

## Projects

Various projects I have been a part of or launched

### WHO app 
- **Progress**: Largely ended advisory in May 2020 / Project ongoing
- **link**: [github](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/app)
- **Collaborators**: with [Bruno Bowden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobowden/) 

Early on, Bruno reached out and had this crazy idea to work with the WHO on their app. I helped connect Bruno and the team with so many people who were working in this space. 

### TCN Coalition / TCN Protocol 
- **link**: [website](http://tcn-coalition.org/), and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCN_Protocol#TCN_Coalition)
- **Progress**: Founded  / Merged into LFPH
- **Collaborators**: [Andreas Gebhard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agebhard/), [Jenny Wanger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennywanger/)

Many remarkable people had come together to create one of the first versions of the Bluetooth exposure notification protocol. I helped organize and bring a lot of these folks together in a coalition. 

One of my favorite parts of the TCN coalition is that a friend introduced me to Jenny as someone who had some time on her hands. She joined me to help write some PRDs for a few pieces of the EN stack. After a month of that she ended being one of the founders of the TCN Coalition! 

### Exposure notification data rights 
- **link**: [website](https://exposurenotification.org/)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**:  Cari Spivack, [Andrew Trask](https://twitter.com/iamtrask?lang=en)

There was a clear need to document and define privacy needs around exposure notification (and what we were calling digital contact tracing). Cari, Andrew, and I spent 2 weeks working through all of the issues we could imagine and attempted to find mitigation strategies. The result was a very informative and easy to understand the document. I am very proud of this work. 

### FNB guide 
- **link**: [website](https://fnbcovidguide.com/)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**: [Vaughn Tan](https://vaughntan.org/)

Vaughn had been working through how to publish his Food and Bev guides. I helped him bring it to the internet. 

### Xihong Lin's NYT Op-ed  
- **link**: [NYT Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/opinion/coronavirus-smart-quarantine.html)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**: [Xihong Lin](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/xihong-lin/),  [Dr. Jordan Shlain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drjordanshlain/), [Jim Yong Kim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Yong_Kim), [Harvey Feinberg](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/harvey-fineberg/), [Dan Sinker](https://twitter.com/dansinker), [Erik Garrison](https://twitter.com/erikgarrison), and [John Battelle](https://twitter.com/johnbattelle)

Erik had the great idea of reaching out to Xihong Lin and doing an op-ed with her. We connected and jammed out the first version of the op-ed. Eventually, we were able to get a fantastic group of people together and publish the op-ed in the NYT. I still think that the idea around smart quarantine, if executed properly, would have allowed the U.S. to exit lockdown. 

This was a really wonderful and collaborative experience. Working with Jim Yong Kim, Jordan Shlain, and Harvey Feinberg was really something. My only regret is that we didn't push harder to include Xihong as an author on the op-ed based on her work. 

### Home Care guide 
- **Link**: [website](https://homecarebasics.org/)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**: [John Wilbanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilbanks), [Juhan Sonin](http://www.mit.edu/~juhan/)

Worked with John to help draft the Home Care Guide. Then showed Juhan what we had done with the FNB guide and helped get the Home Care Guide published

### Last Mile PPE 
- **Link**: [website](https://lastmile.works)
- **documented**: [New Yorker piece](https://www.newyorker.com/news/us-journal/the-underground-efforts-to-get-masks-to-doctors)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**: [Tricia Wang](https://www.triciawang.com/), [DJ Skelton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/djskelton/), [Chris Hosmer](https://www.chrishosmer.com/)

The Last Mile group is an incredible group that we built on top of our PPE WhatsApp group. It ballooned into a fantastic org right at the apex of COVID-19 in NYC. Tricia and the team did an amazing job of building a grassroots org that still exists today. 

### Zooooom.us (silly) 
- **link**: [website](http://zooooom.us/)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**: [Tolar](https://twitter.com/tolar), [Christine Sun Kim](http://christinesunkim.com/) 

Tolar is addicted to screensavers. It is a problem. We made this screensaver to try and match the anxiety we all felt. It was a nightmare screensaver. Also awesome. Christine then suggested we do the same, but with only deaf people. It turned out to be a favorite collab. 

### Contact Tracing Playbook 
- **Link**: [website](https://contacttracingplaybook.org/)
-  **Progress**: Done / Ongoing
- **Collaborators**: [USDR](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/)

USDR and Resolve to Save lives were spending a lot of time talking about contact tracing and how people had no idea what or how to do it. USDR folks (and myself!) took a week or two and pumped out this excellent summary playbook on contact tracing. Some of the content made it's way into Resolve to Save Live's playbooks.

### Exposure Notification Event
- **Progress**: Done 
- **Collaborators**: [USDR](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/) / [Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/), [IQT](https://www.iqt.org/)

I had spent a bunch of time talking to states and various European countries. The U.S. folks were trying to understand the efficacy, and the E.U. folks were trying to tell their story about effectiveness. It turned out to be an amazing opportunity to convene some of the best folks who thought about efficacy with the folks who had questions about it. 

I was lucky to pitch the event to USDR, who then got Rockefeller involved. They were able to take it and make it into a real thing. It turned out fantastic.

# Summary

Overall it was a really short 9 months. Wild, tbh. I learned so so much—both about myself and about communities. There were very few bad actors and trolls - mostly outstanding people trying to make the world better.

In the end, I had spoken to around 15 states in one way or another. Maybe a half dozen countries. I had spoken to most of the big players in the space. I think the work that I did help. In some cases, it is still ongoing.

Last week I finished the last of the big pieces of my COVID-19 work. It marked the end of my time being "full time" on COVID-19. I often joke that I wish my lockdown hobby had been something other than "COVID-19." 

Lots of incredible people helped out and were around. I really thank them and think about them almost every day. Luckily most of this work was organized around WhatsApp, zoom chats, and weird emails - which means they are just a message away at all times. 

# Next

Obviously, the year is not over - however, the brunt of my COVID-19 involvement is. Although I am still advising many of the orgs, I am no longer involved in a day to day basis. 

I am now focused on a new thing. I am very excited. You should be too. It is going to be galactic.
