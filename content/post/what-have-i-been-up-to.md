title: "What have I been up to? "

2020 has been a real **motherfucker** of a year (and it isn't even over!). Like everyone (and especially those of us in the U.S.), I have spent a lot of this year try to understand my place in this new world. I left PayPal in 2018 with the idea of figuring out what was next. I had a simple plan and early in 2020 it seemed that I was on the track of something exciting and big. Then COVID-19 hit. Everything stopped! 

Like most folks, I spent the first couple of weeks reeling with our new reality. Then I got to work. 

Many folks have been asking me, "**What have you been up to?**" I never have the right answer. I originally wrote  this as a way of remembering all the random stuff I was doing. But quickly realized that it was a really great way of answering that question.

# Harper's COVID-19 work

Over the past several months, I have been doing a lot of work around COVID-19. Most of it has been around community organizing, tech enablement, or privacy. Here is a light summary of what I have been up to since mid-January. I created this list as a useful way to remember what I am doing. It has been helpful to describe the COVID-19 work that I have done. 

Here is what I have been up to since the beginning of the year (2020). 

(Would love chat about any of this stuff - so feel free to [send me an email ](mailto:harper@modest.com))

## Communities I started

The basis for my career and one of the things I find most powerful is community. The beginning of COVID-19 was no different. I was able to build, participate, and be a part of some amazing communities. 

What was different, though, was the venue. Most of the communities I started existed first on WhatsApp and then spun off into other platforms. WhatsApp (although owned by facebook - big downside) is very good for group messaging. It is fast, light, and easy to use. More importantly, it is international. In the beginning, all of these communities were global communities. 

My friend, Tricia Wang, descibed the use of chat apps as communities best in her piece about [Chinese COVID-19 communities on WeChat](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/triciawang/a-lesson-from-the-people-of-wuhan-community-hyper-local). The online Chinese communities did this well before we did. 

### COVID-1919: real info only (active)
- Created: 1/21/2020
- Population: 133
    
The O.G. of chat groups. It was composed entirely of a group of scientists, doctors, epidemiologists, data folks, and hackers focused on the *science* part of COVID-19. It was started relatively early in the year (before COVID-19 was COVID-19) and thus the focus on "real info only" (as coined by Dr. Jordan Shlain). 

This community is still going and working together to talk about COVID-19 and its impact. 

### Clinicians community (active)
- Created: 3/13/2020
- Population: 114

Dr. Jordan Shlain pitched an idea to make a copy of the "real info only" group but only be clinicians. The idea was that anyone could watch, but only clinicians could talk. It was entirely self-policed and worked out really well. A lot of amazing people are participating in this community. 

### Sourcing PPE community (Ended) (success)
- Created: 3/19/2020
- Population: 175
- Supply chains have come back (For the most part)

When the supply chain broke down in the U.S., we splintered a few folks from the main channel and we started thinking through how to source PPE, etc. This group spent a lot of resources thinking through how to fill the holes that had been put into the U.S. supply chain. It was a success. An amazing amount of work and effort came from this group. 

Eventually, it ended up dying out - but not before a handful of really fantastic orgs spun out - including the Last Mile. 

### DIY PPE/Equipment community (dead) (success)
- Created: 3/28/2020
- Population: 95
- Supply chains have come back. 

Very similar to the other PPE channel - but more focused on the DIY side. A lot of talk about ventilators and baking N95 masks. 

### Data Science community (dead)
- Created: 3/11/2020
- Population: 44

The data side. My friend [Nikete](https://twitter.com/nikete?lang=en) has an amazing network of data hackers and scientists who wanted to help out. We did a lot of work around visualizing hotspots from mobile phone carrier data, and some work around modeling COVID-19. It was a shorter-lived community, but we had a lot of fun trying to solve some big problems.

## Projects

Lots of my work was on some very discrete projects. Here they are.

### WHO app 
- **Progress**: Largely ended advisory in May 2020 / Project ongoing
- **link**: [github](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/app)
- **Collaborators**: with [Bruno Bowden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobowden/) 

Early on, Bruno reached out and had this crazy idea to work with the WHO on their app. It was a really strong idea and plan. He assembled an amazing team of people and started building it earlier than almost anyone. 

I helped connect Bruno and the team with so many people who were working in this space. 

### TCN Coalition / TCN Protocol 
- **link**: [website](http://tcn-coalition.org/), and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCN_Protocol#TCN_Coalition)
- **Progress**: Founded  / Merged into LFPH
- **Collaborators**: [Andreas Gebhard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agebhard/), [Jenny Wanger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennywanger/)

Lots of different groups came together early in the year to create one of the first versions of the Bluetooth exposure notification protocol. I helped organize and bring a lot of these folks together in a coalition. 

One of my favorite parts of the TCN coalition is that a friend introduced me to Jenny as someone who had some time on her hands. She joined me to help write some PRDs for a few pieces of the EN stack. After a month of that she ended being one of the founders of the TCN Coalition! 

### Exposure notification data rights 
- **link**: [website](https://exposurenotification.org/)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**:  Cari Spivack, [Andrew Trask](https://twitter.com/iamtrask?lang=en)

After working on Exposure Notification for a month or so, it became super clear that there was a need to document and define the privacy needs around exposure notification (and what we were calling at that time *digital contact tracing*). Cari, Andrew, and I spent weeks working through all of the issues we could imagine and attempted to find mitigation strategies for each one. The result was a very informative and easy to understand the document. It became some what of a bill of rights for orgs that were working in this space. 

I am very proud of this work. 

### FNB guide 
- **link**: [website](https://fnbcovidguide.com/)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**: [Vaughn Tan](https://vaughntan.org/)

Vaughn had been working through how to publish his Food and Bev guides. I helped him bring it to the internet. 

It was fun and a neat way to do quick publishing of important content that is changing often. 

Fun fact: did you know you can link directly to the PDF export of a public google doc?

### Xihong Lin's NYT Op-ed  
- **link**: [NYT Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/opinion/coronavirus-smart-quarantine.html)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**: [Xihong Lin](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/xihong-lin/),  [Dr. Jordan Shlain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drjordanshlain/), [Jim Yong Kim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Yong_Kim), [Harvey Feinberg](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/harvey-fineberg/), [Dan Sinker](https://twitter.com/dansinker), [Erik Garrison](https://twitter.com/erikgarrison), and [John Battelle](https://twitter.com/johnbattelle)

Erik had the great idea of reaching out to Xihong Lin and doing an op-ed with her. Her work is amazing and instrumental in helping us understand how COVID-19 spreads in our communities. 

We connected and jammed out the first version of the op-ed. Eventually, we were able to get a fantastic group of people together and publish the op-ed in the NYT. I still think that the idea around smart quarantine, if executed properly, would have allowed the U.S. to exit lockdown. 

This was a really wonderful and collaborative experience. Working with Jim Yong Kim, Jordan Shlain, and Harvey Feinberg was really something. My only regret is that we didn't push harder to include Xihong as an author on the op-ed based on her work. 

### Home Care guide 
- **Link**: [website](https://homecarebasics.org/)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**: [John Wilbanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilbanks), [Juhan Sonin](http://www.mit.edu/~juhan/)

I worked with John to help draft his Home Care Guide. Then showed Juhan what we had done with Van's FNB guide and helped get the Home Care Guide published. We used the same PDF export trick there too. 

### Last Mile PPE 
- **Link**: [website](https://lastmile.works)
- **documented**: [New Yorker piece](https://www.newyorker.com/news/us-journal/the-underground-efforts-to-get-masks-to-doctors)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**: [Tricia Wang](https://www.triciawang.com/), [DJ Skelton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/djskelton/), [Chris Hosmer](https://www.chrishosmer.com/)

The Last Mile group is an incredible group that we built on top of our PPE WhatsApp group. It ballooned into a fantastic org right at the apex of COVID-19 in NYC. 

Tricia and the team did an amazing job of building a grassroots org that still exists today. As documented in the New Yorker article, it was instrumental in helping New Yorkers working on the front lines get the PPE they need.

### Zooooom.us (silly) 
- **link**: [website](http://zooooom.us/)
-  **Progress**: Done
- **Collaborators**: [Tolar](https://twitter.com/tolar), [Christine Sun Kim](http://christinesunkim.com/) 

My friend Tolar is addicted to screensavers. It is a problem. 

We made this screensaver to try and match the anxiety we all felt during the beginning of COVID-19 times. It was a nightmare screensaver. Everytime your computer slept it was like a new zoom call was starting. 

Christine then suggested we do the same, but with only deaf people. It turned out to be one of my favorite collabs.  Also movie stars! 

### Contact Tracing Playbook 
- **Link**: [website](https://contacttracingplaybook.org/)
-  **Progress**: Done / Ongoing
- **Collaborators**: [USDR](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/)

USDR and Resolve to Save lives were spending a lot of time talking about contact tracing and how lots of folks had no idea what or how to do it. USDR folks (and myself!) took a week and pumped out this excellent summary playbook on contact tracing. Some of the content made its way into the Resolve to Save Live's playbooks.

It has also continued to be a good resource. 

### Convening on Exposure Notification Efficacy
- **Progress**: Done 
- **Collaborators**: [USDR](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/) / [Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/), [IQT](https://www.iqt.org/)

Over the last few months, I have spent a bunch of time talking to states and various European countries about Exposure Notification. 

The U.S. folks were trying to understand the efficacy, and the E.U. folks were trying to tell their story about its effectiveness. 

It turned out to be an amazing opportunity to convene some of the best folks who thought about efficacy with the folks who had questions about it. 

I was lucky to pitch the event to USDR, who then got Rockefeller involved. They were able to take it and make it into a real thing. It turned out fantastic.

## Writing

I have written more blog posts during 2020 than I have for years. It has been nice.

# Summary, sort of. 

Overall it was a really short 9 months. Wild, tbh. I learned so so much — both about myself, about viruses and about communities. 

The communties were amazing. Full of outstanding people trying to make the world better. It was a delightful group to be a part of. 

In the end, I had worked with, and spoken to -  around 15 states in one way or another. And maybe a half dozen countries. I had spoken to most of the big companies in the space. It was sometimes frustrating and mostly helpful. It was always worthwhile. 

Two weeks ago I finished the last of the big pieces of my COVID-19 work. It marked the end of my time being "full time" on COVID-19. I often joke that I wish my lockdown hobby had been something other than "COVID-19." But here we are. 

The best part was the people. Lots of incredible people helped out, participated, and were around to do work. I really thank every one of them. I think about the work we all did almost every day. Luckily, since most of the work was organized around WhatsApp, zoom chats, and weird emails - it is really easy to hit them up again and do another crazy  project. 

I can't wait for COVID-20. lol. jk. 

# Next

Obviously, the year is not over - however, the brunt of my COVID-19 involvement is. Although I am still advising many of the organizations that I worked with, I am no longer involved on a day to day basis. 

I am now focused on a new thing. I am very excited. You should be too. It is going to be galactic.
