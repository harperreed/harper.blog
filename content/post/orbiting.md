tldr; check out [orbiting](https://orbiting.com) and communicate with people in a visual textual sort of way. Orbiting is a simple app that displays very big words to help communicate to others visually. Try it out: [orbiting.com](https://orbiting.com)

This is a really exciting blog post to write. 

Back in 2013, I met the fantastic artist [Christine Sun Kim](http://christinesunkim.com/). We met at TED in Long Beach and instantly became friends. I remember seeing her from a long ways away. She was surrounded by a gaggle of people all clamoring to interact. Lot's of laughter and a lot of hijinx. I wanted to be a part of that crew so bad. So... i walked over and said hi! We then went and hung out on boats and partied until dawn. It was fun. 

Being that Christine and I communicate in drastically different ways (I talk with verbal speech, and CK communicates via sign language) we needed to find some middle ground to be able to converse. At TED there were interpreters (who were excellent), but they went to bed at some point - so we needed something easy and accessible to everyone. In 2013 we used many native iOS apps that were pretty good - but had issues (cost money, barely worked, etc). This leads us to think about what a "perfect" app could be for this context of hanging. 

Flash forward about 200 years to 2015. Christine and I have hung out a lot. We have spent many a night in clubs, bars, restaurants with all sorts of people. With interpreters and without. In all the cases - the mobile apps helped us hang. But they were not quite there yet. We decided to make our own. 

I, of course, made it way more complicated than it needed to be. I understand that is my role in life - but it would have been nice to skip the complicated versions that I made over the next two years. 

The original idea (circa 2015) was that we should have a "big words" like networked app (via Bluetooth - of course) that would allow a group of people to communicate without having to hear audio. Think loud club, etc. It was and may still be an exciting idea. We build it, of course. Our friend [Jovan Jovanovic](https://twitter.com/jovan90j) made the prototype, and it worked. Almost.  We never actually got it working well. 

Then we tried again. This time we included a great product manager type, [Sophia Kecir Camper](http://www.sophiakc.com/),  and an excellent designer, [Nick Ng](https://www.nickng.co/). They really helped get our next version into a good place. It was a simpler version of the prototype. Much simpler, much better code and it worked. We called it [Orbiting](https://orbiting.com) because it allowed a message to orbit around a group of people (also i had the domain). 

We launched it. Nobody used it. 

It turns out that our use case wasn't really what people needed. People wanted  something *much simpler.* We needed a cross-platform "big text" app that worked, was free and was SIMPLE., of course, we didn't realize that then. 

In 2018 Christine and I helped facilitate a fantastic group of people to create something under the topic of "Deaf and AI" for an MIT Media Lab workshop in Berlin. The group we worked with, built out an idea that would help ordinary people add sign language to a corpus for AI and machine learning researchers to use. It turns out that there is not a corpus of sign language that researchers can use that is made by deaf people. Most of the available corpii are made by hearing people imitating sign language. The group did a great job of learning about Deaf culture and really jumping right in. One of the participants, Sam Roots, wrote up a couple great blog posts about the experience - read them [here](https://www.sam-roots.com/blog/2018/8/23/ml-berlin-signal-noise) and [here](https://www.sam-roots.com/blog/2018/8/28/deaf-culture-first-impressions).

Towards the end of this workshop, Christine and I started talking again about what should become of Orbiting. The version we launched with the larger team was too complicated (and had somehow disappeared from the app store). I decided to see what I could do by just building a better app without the fancy networking parts. I wanted something quick. I also tried to do it with more accessible technology. In a few hours, I had a prototype. Then over a few months of hacking, we had something that basically worked in most situations. 

[Orbiting.com](https://orbiting.com) was born and working. It was simple. It was free. People started using it.

For a little less than a year, it was just chilling and working. Then CK, Nick and I decided to dive in and fix it up. Add some of the features we had been talking about (video background for projecting during performances, etc.). 

**Today**, we pushed the newest version live. It is a straightforward web app that you can install on your phone like a native app. It should work on all devices. This is awesome - because anyone can use it. 

Our goal was to build something that allowed for more accessible communication for most people. Something super simple and easy. This seems to be it. 

If you want, you are welcome to pitch in. We need help, and Orbiting is [open source](https://github.com/harperreed/orbiting). I would love to see some refactoring, [fixing of issues](https://github.com/harperreed/orbiting/issues) or really just comments. 

Hopefully, this is helpful to you. I know that it is useful to CK, Nick and I.
