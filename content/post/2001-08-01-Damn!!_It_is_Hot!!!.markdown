excerpt: It is so hot here in chi-town. I have never been in such an inferno degree.
  I don't mind it really, but it is so relentless. I sit here trying to code, tryin
  gto read waiting for something to happen. For it to get cooler. For someone to tell
  me "hey, its nice and cool over here" but... nothing makes it better. and time only
  makes it worse....
