excerpt: 'Yea you know me. anyway. today for lunch me and some coworkers went to OTB.
  OTB is "off track betting." and is fun and addicting. The funniest shit happened
  while I was there: they thanked all the veterns for fighting for freedom so we could
  "sit here and smoke, drink eat and gamble." WTF. that is exactly what they are fighting
  to maintain. it ruled. I lost 6 dollars.'
