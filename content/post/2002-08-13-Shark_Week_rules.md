excerpt: "Tonight we watched shark week for awhile. It was great. The air jaws show
  was incredible. I think that sharks could singlehandedly be the coolest animal I
  have ever seen. Sharks are like aliens.. hehe but we get to see them. and hang out
  with them. they look so foreign. so mean. so evil. and so so cool. \r\nspeaking
  of aliens. we are going to see signs soon. "
