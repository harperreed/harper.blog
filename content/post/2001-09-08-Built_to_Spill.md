excerpt: 'I went to built to spill tonight. It was a good time. They played freebird
  as the last song. It was very very good. I enjoyed it quite a lot. Doug(if that
  is his name) was a good guitar player. The audience was OK, Except for some assholes
  who were harrasing a simple drunk man. I was sad for him. But eventually the dumbasses
  were kicked out.. weee.. '
