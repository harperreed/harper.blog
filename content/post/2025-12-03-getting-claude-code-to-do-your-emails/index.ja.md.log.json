It started cuz the holidays are overwhelming, and I felt like I was constantly behind. My inbox was overflowing with everything I had deemed important, and I hadn’t been able to make a dent. It was stressful. It still is!\n\n{{% figure src=\"R0002380.jpeg\" caption=\"Maybe a storm?, Ricoh GRiiix, 11/2025\" %}}\n\nI had just seen the [zo.computer](https://zo.computer) launch (neat project!) and it reminded me that [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) has this wild MCP server that you can use to connect to literally anything Pipedream supports. This means I could use it to do my emails! Problem solved. Problem created. More problems created! WHY ARE WE COUNTING PROBLEMS!\n\n## How? Why? HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT\n\nI love email. I really do. Typically I am really great at managing my email. However, when the email gets overwhelming - I end up ignoring it. Which means it gets worse. Which means everyone loses.\n\nI just need a way to start doing my email that is pretty low pressure. Using Claude Code has made it MUCH easier.\n\n1. I boot up a Claude Code session hooked to the proper MCP servers.\n2. I ask it to check my email\n3. It tells me what email is in my inbox that needs addressing (unread, then read email)\n4. Either offers to start fixing emails, or just starts writing drafts intelligently (checks my calendar, searches for context, etc).\n5. Says “We are done!”\n6. I go to my email client, and check the drafts. Edit and send most of them cuz they are great. Reject a few.\n7. Rinse Repeat\n8. Bacon\n\nBasically, I just have Claude Code check my email, and then pops out a message like “your brother emailed asking about thanksgiving plans” and I say “cool. Tell him we will be there, and will bring turkey juice or whatever you call stuffing” and then Claude Code will write an email that is approximately what I said but in the style it found from your past emails.\n\nI then specifically save it as a draft that I review heavily before sending.\n\n> I trust these agents to write code way way more than I trust them to write an email to a friend, stranger or business partner. It is pretty close, but not quite close enough to go yolo mode and let it send. Maybe soon? Or maybe a different email address? Who knows.\n\nIt works remarkably well. However, there are some gotchas\n\n### Funny story that isn’t so funny.\n\nA while back I was prototyping an email triaging agent with some code I had written, and it was working well but not great. A friend connected me to a person who was looking for someone to write a book about AI. The agent was like “this person wants to talk about writing a book about ai, they want a skeptical and academic perspective about AI’s impact” and I was like “I LOVE THIS. But this isn’t for me. I have some friends that would be good.” However, there was a bug, and the agent was drafting replies before getting feedback from me. And it ended up sending the previous draft that said very formally: “I would love to do this.”\n\nThe person excitedly replied and was like “let’s do this.”\n\nThat is when I found out that I fucked up. So I replied back and was like “well. My agents said yes for me before talking. Here is what I meant to say” and that person rightfully replied “**F U**”\n\n### You cannot trust these things.\n\nThis is why I am cautiously doing it again. Haha. This time I am way more careful, and the agent cannot send email only draft it. I am finding that I am editing every email - but only a little, and maybe less and less. Feels like a year ago with codegen.\n\nThus far it works pretty well. It allows me to get through a lot of email that I normally would ignore, giving me space to focus on the emails I really want to reply to. Basically it cleans up the cruft (vendors, services, etc) and allows me to hang out with my friends. Perfect AI usage.\n\nI recommend it.\n\n## Replicate my setup?? If you dare!\n\nI didn’t want to start fresh every time so I built a super simple Claude Code “directory.”\n\nIt has most of the things that you will need to handle triaging your inbox.\n\n```\n📁 .\n├── 📁 .claude\n│   ├── 📄 CLAUDE.md\n│   ├── 📄 settings.json\n│   └── 📁 skills\n│       ├── 📁 crm-management\n│       │   └── 📄 SKILL.md\n│       └── 📁 email-management\n│           └── 📄 SKILL.md\n├── 📄 .mcp.json\n```\n\nThere are a few important parts:\n\n### The CLAUDE.md\n\nThis is highly personal (how do you manage YOUR inbox), and very important. The first thing I did was have Claude go through the past couple hundred emails I have sent, and develop a vibe for how I write emails. After a bit of back and forth, we have this:\n\n```\n1. **Find the thread**: Search for the original email/thread to get context\n2. **Get thread details**: Retrieve the thread ID, message ID, AND recipient email address for proper threading\n3. **Check for calendar events**: If the email mentions an event, proactively check calendar and add it\n4. **Draft the email**:\n    - **CRITICAL**: Always explicitly provide the `To:` email address - the MCP tool does NOT auto-extract it from threads\n    - Keep it ultra-concise (but adjust based on context - some emails need warmth)\n    - Match Harper's voice (casual, direct, no fluff)\n    - No signatures or sign-offs\n5. **Always create as DRAFT**: Never send directly - always save as draft\n6. **Ensure proper threading**: When replying, use thread ID and in-reply-to message ID so the draft appears in the conversation thread\n7. **Iterate on feedback**: Harper will refine the wording - update the draft as needed\n```\n\n### The skills\n\nThen I went through and did a bunch of emails via Claude Code. It did ok. But I was able to coach it, and once it was in a good place I had it make a skill based on what we discovered together.\n\n```\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **Always draft, never send** - Save emails as drafts so Harper can review before sending\n2. **Threading is critical** - Replies must appear in the correct conversation thread\n3. **Match Harper's voice** - Ultra-concise, casual, no signatures\n4. **Extract structured data** - Pull event details, action items, contact info from emails\n```\n\nAnd\n\n```\n## Success Criteria\n\nYou've successfully handled email tasks when:\n- Drafts appear in correct conversation threads\n- Harper says \"looks good\" without needing changes\n- Calendar events are added proactively\n- Inbox summaries surface what matters\n- Process feels efficient and natural\n\n## Remember\n\nEmail is personal communication using Harper's voice. The goal is to save time while maintaining authentic, effective communication that sounds like Harper wrote it.\n\nWhen in doubt: shorter, more casual, and always draft first.\n```\n\nHaving Claude build its own skills is clutch. You really need to iterate to make it happen.\n\n### the tools!\n\nI am still mad about MCP as a concept, but not mad enough not to use it.\n\nThe goal is to simply give Claude Code a suite of tools that allows it to do its job well.\n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"pd\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2\"\n    },\n    \"pagen\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"pagen\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"toki\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"toki\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"chronicle\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"chronicle\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Pipedream\n\nThe [Pipedream MCP](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/developers) is very straight forward. You essentially add it to your Claude Code (works in other clients too), and then it will pop you through their auth. Once auth’d you add various services. Those services are then exposed as MCP tools. These are clutch. You can then use Claude to wire together some workflows.\n\nI currently use their Gmail, Google Calendar, and Contacts connections.\n\n### The others:\n\nI created 3 simple MCP servers that I wanted to exist:\n\n#### Toki\n\na super straight forward todo tracker on the CLI. The plan is to build out support for various backends. Currently it is just local.\n\nIt works as a cli app or as a mcp server:\n\nYou can try it out here:\n\n- [harperreed/toki](https://github.com/harperreed/toki)\n- `brew install harperreed/tap/toki`\n\n#### Chronicle\n\na log for agent actions. I want my agents to log what they have been up to!\n\nYou can try it out here:\n\n- [harperreed/chronicle](https://github.com/harperreed/chronicle)\n- `brew install harperreed/tap/chronicle`\n\n#### pagen\n\na misspelled crm that acts as my **p**ersonal **agen**t backend. This allows me to have reasonable understanding of where I am from a comms, etc standpoint\n\nYou can try it out here:\n\n- [harperreed/pagen](https://github.com/harperreed/pagen)\n- `brew install harperreed/tap/pagen`\n\n### Wrapping it together.\n\nThe robust skill, the claude.md and the MCP tools make this a pretty easy and helpful system for triaging email. It is not perfect, but it does work nicely.\n\nI do recommend playing around with this. I would maybe be cautious about blindly trusting it. Lol.\n\n## Wanna try it?!\n\nI made a simple plugin that should do this for you. All you gotta do is install it!\n\nInstallation Now:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add harperreed/office-admin-claude\n/plugin install office-admin\n/setup-office-admin\n```\n\nYMMV\n\n## This is obviously the future.\n\nWhether we like it or not, it appears that agentic email will be a thing. It is early enough that we will start to see people like myself building bespoke and custom experiences that largely do what a product will do. Somehow Google will launch a version directly in gmail, that somehow doesn’t work. My guess is that the best versions will be like Mimestream or superhuman that are primarily agentic. I hope it isn’t primarily chat - but we shall see.\n\nI do recommend playing with this. Especially if you have a lot of email that you need to take care of. I think of it as clearing brush. You don’t want to fuck up the flowers (all of you. you are my flowers), but you don’t mind cutting down the weeds (all of them! You can see the random emails about business loans lurking in the corners..)\n\n### Privacy, what privacy!!\n\nMy emails are going through Pipedream, and Anthropic. This is not ideal. it is obviously a privacy concern. I can't wait to run these things locally, and maybe have an MCP server that interacts directly with Google Suite.\n\n### Be cautious\n\n{{% figure src=\"L1030630.jpeg\" caption=\"Not even once, Leica Q, 11/2017\" %}}\n\nGiving your agents access to things that affect other people is scary and should be done with caution. It works pretty well for me, but I did totally fuck up a few situations trying this out.\n\nMy inbox is pristine. DO NOT SEND ME EMAILS! IT IS BEAUTIFUL!",

It is pretty close, but not quite close enough to go yolo mode and let it send. Maybe soon? Or maybe a different email address? Who knows.\n\nIt works remarkably well.

Haha. This time I am way more careful, and the agent cannot send email only draft it. I am finding that I am editing every email - but only a little, and maybe less and less. Feels like a year ago with codegen.\n\n→ だから今回は慎重にやっています。笑　今度は送信権限を与えず、下書きまで。毎回少しは手直ししていますが、その量もだんだん減ってきた感じ。コード生成を試し始めた頃と同じ感覚ですね。\n\nThus far it works pretty well. It allows me to get through a lot of email that I normally would ignore, giving me space to focus on the emails I really want to reply to. Basically it cleans up the cruft (vendors, services, etc) and allows me to hang out with my friends. Perfect AI usage.\n\nI recommend it.\n\n→ 今のところかなり快適。普段なら放置しがちなメールをさばいてくれて、本当に返したいメールに集中できます。ベンダーやサービス系の “ノイズ” を片付け、友人とのやり取りに時間を割ける。AI の理想的な使い方ですね。おすすめです。\n\n## Replicate my setup??

After a bit of back and forth, we have this:\n\n→ まずは CLAUDE.md。これは完全にパーソナル設定（あなたの受信箱をどう捌くか）で、超重要。最初に、過去数百通の送信メールを Claude に読ませて、自分のメールの “ノリ” をつかませました。やり取りの末、こんな感じに。\n\n```\n1. **Find the thread**: Search for the original email/thread to get context\n2. **Get thread details**: Retrieve the thread ID, message ID, AND recipient email address for proper threading\n3. **Check for calendar events**: If the email mentions an event, proactively check calendar and add it\n4. **Draft the email**:\n    - **CRITICAL**: Always explicitly provide the `To:` email address - the MCP tool does NOT auto-extract it from threads\n    - Keep it ultra-concise (but adjust based on context - some emails need warmth)\n    - Match Harper's voice (casual, direct, no fluff)\n    - No signatures or sign-offs\n5. **Always create as DRAFT**: Never send directly - always save as draft\n6. **Ensure proper threading**: When replying, use thread ID and in-reply-to message ID so the draft appears in the conversation thread\n7. **Iterate on feedback**: Harper will refine the wording - update the draft as needed\n```\n\n### The skills\n\nThen I went through and did a bunch of emails via Claude Code.

You can see the random emails about business loans lurking in the corners..)\n\n→ 好むと好まざるとにかかわらず、エージェントがメールを扱う時代は来るでしょう。まだ黎明期なので、私のようにプロダクト顔負けのカスタム体験を自作する人たちが出てくるはず。たぶん Google も Gmail に直接組み込んだ何かを出してくるけど、微妙に動かないんじゃないかな。最終的に良いものは Mimestream や superhuman のような “エージェント前提” クライアントになりそう。チャット主体じゃないといいんだけど…さてどうなるか。\n\n大量のメールを抱えている人は特に、一度試す価値ありです。雑草を刈るみたいなもの。大切な花（あなたたち）を傷つけず、雑草（迷惑メールや融資オファー）だけを刈り取れます。\n\n### Privacy, what privacy!!\n\nMy emails are going through Pipedream, and Anthropic. This is not ideal. it is obviously a privacy concern. I can't wait to run these things locally, and maybe have an MCP server that interacts directly with Google Suite.\n\n→ プライバシー？ ええ、私のメールは Pipedream と Anthropic を経由しています。理想的とは言えません。早くローカルで動かして、Google Suite と直接対話できる MCP サーバーが欲しい！\n\n### Be cautious\n\n{{% figure src=\"L1030630.jpeg\" caption=\"ダメ、絶対, Leica Q, 11/2017\" %}}\n\nGiving your agents access to things that affect other people is scary and should be done with caution. It works pretty well for me, but I did totally fuck up a few situations trying this out.\n\nMy inbox is pristine. DO NOT SEND ME EMAILS! IT IS BEAUTIFUL!\n\n→ 他人に影響を与える権限をエージェントに渡すのは、本当に慎重に行うべきです。私にはうまく機能していますが、試行錯誤の中で何度か大失敗もしました。\n\n受信箱は今、ピッカピカ。メール送らないで！　この美しさを保ちたいんです！",

      "user_prompt": "# ORIGINAL TEXT\nOver the last week or so, I have been using Claude Code to help me with some email, and scheduling. It started cuz the holidays are overwhelming, and I felt like I was constantly behind. My inbox was overflowing with everything I had deemed important, and I hadn’t been able to make a dent. It was stressful. It still is!\n\n{{% figure src=\"R0002380.jpeg\" caption=\"Maybe a storm?, Ricoh GRiiix, 11/2025\" %}}\n\nI had just seen the [zo.computer](https://zo.computer) launch (neat project!) and it reminded me that [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) has this wild MCP server that you can use to connect to literally anything Pipedream supports. This means I could use it to do my emails! Problem solved. Problem created. More problems created! WHY ARE WE COUNTING PROBLEMS!\n\n## How? Why? HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT\n\nI love email. I really do. Typically I am really great at managing my email. However, when the email gets overwhelming - I end up ignoring it. Which means it gets worse. Which means everyone loses.\n\nI just need a way to start doing my email that is pretty low pressure. Using Claude Code has made it MUCH easier.\n\n1. I boot up a Claude Code session hooked to the proper MCP servers.\n2. I ask it to check my email\n3. It tells me what email is in my inbox that needs addressing (unread, then read email)\n4. Either offers to start fixing emails, or just starts writing drafts intelligently (checks my calendar, searches for context, etc).\n5. Says “We are done!”\n6. I go to my email client, and check the drafts. Edit and send most of them cuz they are great. Reject a few.\n7. Rinse Repeat\n8. Bacon\n\nBasically, I just have Claude Code check my email, and then pops out a message like “your brother emailed asking about thanksgiving plans” and I say “cool. Tell him we will be there, and will bring turkey juice or whatever you call stuffing” and then Claude Code will write an email that is approximately what I said but in the style it found from your past emails.\n\nI then specifically save it as a draft that I review heavily before sending.\n\n> I trust these agents to write code way way more than I trust them to write an email to a friend, stranger or business partner. It is pretty close, but not quite close enough to go yolo mode and let it send. Maybe soon? Or maybe a different email address? Who knows.\n\nIt works remarkably well. However, there are some gotchas\n\n### Funny story that isn’t so funny.\n\nA while back I was prototyping an email triaging agent with some code I had written, and it was working well but not great. A friend connected me to a person who was looking for someone to write a book about AI. The agent was like “this person wants to talk about writing a book about ai, they want a skeptical and academic perspective about AI’s impact” and I was like “I LOVE THIS. But this isn’t for me. I have some friends that would be good.” However, there was a bug, and the agent was drafting replies before getting feedback from me. And it ended up sending the previous draft that said very formally: “I would love to do this.”\n\nThe person excitedly replied and was like “let’s do this.”\n\nThat is when I found out that I fucked up. So I replied back and was like “well. My agents said yes for me before talking. Here is what I meant to say” and that person rightfully replied “**F U**”\n\n### You cannot trust these things.\n\nThis is why I am cautiously doing it again. Haha. This time I am way more careful, and the agent cannot send email only draft it. I am finding that I am editing every email - but only a little, and maybe less and less. Feels like a year ago with codegen.\n\nThus far it works pretty well. It allows me to get through a lot of email that I normally would ignore, giving me space to focus on the emails I really want to reply to. Basically it cleans up the cruft (vendors, services, etc) and allows me to hang out with my friends. Perfect AI usage.\n\nI recommend it.\n\n## Replicate my setup?? If you dare!\n\nI didn’t want to start fresh every time so I built a super simple Claude Code “directory.”\n\nIt has most of the things that you will need to handle triaging your inbox.\n\n```\n📁 .\n├── 📁 .claude\n│   ├── 📄 CLAUDE.md\n│   ├── 📄 settings.json\n│   └── 📁 skills\n│       ├── 📁 crm-management\n│       │   └── 📄 SKILL.md\n│       └── 📁 email-management\n│           └── 📄 SKILL.md\n├── 📄 .mcp.json\n```\n\nThere are a few important parts:\n\n### The CLAUDE.md\n\nThis is highly personal (how do you manage YOUR inbox), and very important. The first thing I did was have Claude go through the past couple hundred emails I have sent, and develop a vibe for how I write emails. After a bit of back and forth, we have this:\n\n```\n1. **Find the thread**: Search for the original email/thread to get context\n2. **Get thread details**: Retrieve the thread ID, message ID, AND recipient email address for proper threading\n3. **Check for calendar events**: If the email mentions an event, proactively check calendar and add it\n4. **Draft the email**:\n    - **CRITICAL**: Always explicitly provide the `To:` email address - the MCP tool does NOT auto-extract it from threads\n    - Keep it ultra-concise (but adjust based on context - some emails need warmth)\n    - Match Harper's voice (casual, direct, no fluff)\n    - No signatures or sign-offs\n5. **Always create as DRAFT**: Never send directly - always save as draft\n6. **Ensure proper threading**: When replying, use thread ID and in-reply-to message ID so the draft appears in the conversation thread\n7. **Iterate on feedback**: Harper will refine the wording - update the draft as needed\n```\n\n### The skills\n\nThen I went through and did a bunch of emails via Claude Code. It did ok. But I was able to coach it, and once it was in a good place I had it make a skill based on what we discovered together.\n\n```\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **Always draft, never send** - Save emails as drafts so Harper can review before sending\n2. **Threading is critical** - Replies must appear in the correct conversation thread\n3. **Match Harper's voice** - Ultra-concise, casual, no signatures\n4. **Extract structured data** - Pull event details, action items, contact info from emails\n```\n\nAnd\n\n```\n## Success Criteria\n\nYou've successfully handled email tasks when:\n- Drafts appear in correct conversation threads\n- Harper says \"looks good\" without needing changes\n- Calendar events are added proactively\n- Inbox summaries surface what matters\n- Process feels efficient and natural\n\n## Remember\n\nEmail is personal communication using Harper's voice. The goal is to save time while maintaining authentic, effective communication that sounds like Harper wrote it.\n\nWhen in doubt: shorter, more casual, and always draft first.\n```\n\nHaving Claude build its own skills is clutch. You really need to iterate to make it happen.\n\n### the tools!\n\nI am still mad about MCP as a concept, but not mad enough not to use it.\n\nThe goal is to simply give Claude Code a suite of tools that allows it to do its job well.\n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"pd\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2\"\n    },\n    \"pagen\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"pagen\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"toki\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"toki\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"chronicle\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"chronicle\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Pipedream\n\nThe [Pipedream MCP](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/developers) is very straight forward. You essentially add it to your Claude Code (works in other clients too), and then it will pop you through their auth. Once auth’d you add various services. Those services are then exposed as MCP tools. These are clutch. You can then use Claude to wire together some workflows.\n\nI currently use their Gmail, Google Calendar, and Contacts connections.\n\n### The others:\n\nI created 3 simple MCP servers that I wanted to exist:\n\n#### Toki\n\na super straight forward todo tracker on the CLI. The plan is to build out support for various backends. Currently it is just local.\n\nIt works as a cli app or as a mcp server:\n\nYou can try it out here:\n\n- [harperreed/toki](https://github.com/harperreed/toki)\n- `brew install harperreed/tap/toki`\n\n#### Chronicle\n\na log for agent actions. I want my agents to log what they have been up to!\n\nYou can try it out here:\n\n- [harperreed/chronicle](https://github.com/harperreed/chronicle)\n- `brew install harperreed/tap/chronicle`\n\n#### pagen\n\na misspelled crm that acts as my **p**ersonal **agen**t backend. This allows me to have reasonable understanding of where I am from a comms, etc standpoint\n\nYou can try it out here:\n\n- [harperreed/pagen](https://github.com/harperreed/pagen)\n- `brew install harperreed/tap/pagen`\n\n### Wrapping it together.\n\nThe robust skill, the claude.md and the MCP tools make this a pretty easy and helpful system for triaging email. It is not perfect, but it does work nicely.\n\nI do recommend playing around with this. I would maybe be cautious about blindly trusting it. Lol.\n\n## Wanna try it?!\n\nI made a simple plugin that should do this for you. All you gotta do is install it!\n\nInstallation Now:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add harperreed/office-admin-claude\n/plugin install office-admin\n/setup-office-admin\n```\n\nYMMV\n\n## This is obviously the future.\n\nWhether we like it or not, it appears that agentic email will be a thing. It is early enough that we will start to see people like myself building bespoke and custom experiences that largely do what a product will do. Somehow Google will launch a version directly in gmail, that somehow doesn’t work. My guess is that the best versions will be like Mimestream or superhuman that are primarily agentic. I hope it isn’t primarily chat - but we shall see.\n\nI do recommend playing with this. Especially if you have a lot of email that you need to take care of. I think of it as clearing brush. You don’t want to fuck up the flowers (all of you. you are my flowers), but you don’t mind cutting down the weeds (all of them! You can see the random emails about business loans lurking in the corners..)\n\n### Privacy, what privacy!!\n\nMy emails are going through Pipedream, and Anthropic. This is not ideal. it is obviously a privacy concern.

It was stressful. It still is!\n\n→ ここ 1 週間ほど、メールとスケジュール管理を手伝ってもらうために Claude Code を使っています。ホリデーシーズンでてんやわんや、常に遅れを取っている感覚に襲われたのがきっかけでした。受信箱は「重要」だと判断したメールで溢れ返り、手を付ける余裕もなし。ストレス全開。いや、今もストレスです！\n\n{{% figure src=\"R0002380.jpeg\" caption=\"嵐かも？, Ricoh GRiiix, 11/2025\" %}}\n\nI had just seen the [zo.computer](https://zo.computer) launch (neat project!) and it reminded me that [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) has this wild MCP server that you can use to connect to literally anything Pipedream supports.

I really do. Typically I am really great at managing my email. However, when the email gets overwhelming - I end up ignoring it. Which means it gets worse. Which means everyone loses.\n\n→ メールは大好きなんです。本当に。普段はうまく捌けるんですが、量が多くなると放置→さらに悪化→みんな損、の悪循環に陥ります。\n\nI just need a way to start doing my email that is pretty low pressure. Using Claude Code has made it MUCH easier.\n\n→ もっと気楽に着手できる方法が欲しかったんですが、Claude Code で一気にラクになりました。\n\n1. I boot up a Claude Code session hooked to the proper MCP servers.\n2. I ask it to check my email\n3. It tells me what email is in my inbox that needs addressing (unread, then read email)\n4.

I go to my email client, and check the drafts. Edit and send most of them cuz they are great. Reject a few.\n7. Rinse Repeat\n8. Bacon\n\n→\n1. 適切な MCP サーバーに繋いだ Claude Code セッションを起動  \n2. 「メールチェックして」と依頼  \n3. 受信箱にある対処すべきメール（未読→既読の順）を教えてくれる  \n4. 「処理しようか？」と聞かれるか、勝手に下書きを書き始める（カレンダー確認、文脈検索などをしてくれる）  \n5. 「完了！」  \n6. メーラーで下書きを確認。大半はそのまま送信、いくつかは却下  \n7. 以下ループ  \n8. ベーコン（お約束）\n\nBasically, I just have Claude Code check my email, and then pops out a message like “your brother emailed asking about thanksgiving plans” and I say “cool. Tell him we will be there, and will bring turkey juice or whatever you call stuffing” and then Claude Code will write an email that is approximately what I said but in the style it found from your past emails.\n\n→ 要は、Claude Code にメールをチェックさせると「兄から感謝祭の予定についてメールが来てるよ」みたいに教えてくれるので、「了解。行くよって伝えて、詰め物…じゃなくて“ターキージュース”か何かを持ってくって書いといて」と答えるだけ。すると過去メールの文体を真似て、ほぼそのまんまの内容の下書きを作ってくれるんです。\n\nI then specifically save it as a draft that I review heavily before sending.\n\n→ その下書きを必ず保存し、送る前にしっかり確認。\n\n> I trust these agents to write code way way more than I trust them to write an email to a friend, stranger or business partner. It is pretty close, but not quite close enough to go yolo mode and let it send. Maybe soon? Or maybe a different email address? Who knows.\n\nIt works remarkably well. However, there are some gotchas\n\n→ 驚くほどうまくいきます。ただ、いくつかハマりどころも。\n\n### Funny story that isn’t so funny.\n\nA while back I was prototyping an email triaging agent with some code I had written, and it was working well but not great. A friend connected me to a person who was looking for someone to write a book about AI.

So I replied back and was like “well. My agents said yes for me before talking. Here is what I meant to say” and that person rightfully replied “**F U**”\n\n→ 以前、自作コードでメール仕分けエージェントを試作していたときのこと。友人が「AI についての本を書いてくれる人」を探している方を紹介してくれました。エージェントいわく「AI の影響について懐疑的かつ学術的視点で書ける人を求めてます」とのこと。「面白そう！ でも自分じゃないな。適任の友達がいる」と思っていたんですが、バグのおかげでエージェントが私の確認前に返信下書きを作成→なんと送信までしてしまい、「ぜひやらせてください」と超フォーマルな返事が相手に届いてしまいました。\n\n相手は大喜びで「やりましょう！」と返信。  \nそこでミスに気づき、「すみません、エージェントが先走って『はい』と答えちゃいました。本当はこう言いたかったんです」と返事したら、相手からは当然の「**F U**」。\n\n### You cannot trust these things.\n\nThis is why I am cautiously doing it again. Haha. This time I am way more careful, and the agent cannot send email only draft it. I am finding that I am editing every email - but only a little, and maybe less and less. Feels like a year ago with codegen.\n\n→ だから今回は慎重にやっています。笑　今度は送信権限を与えず、下書きまで。毎回少しは手直ししていますが、その量もだんだん減ってきた感じ。コード生成を試し始めた頃と同じ感覚ですね。\n\nThus far it works pretty well. It allows me to get through a lot of email that I normally would ignore, giving me space to focus on the emails I really want to reply to. Basically it cleans up the cruft (vendors, services, etc) and allows me to hang out with my friends. Perfect AI usage.\n\nI recommend it.\n\n→ 今のところかなり快適。普段なら放置しがちなメールをさばいてくれて、本当に返したいメールに集中できます。ベンダーやサービス系の “ノイズ” を片付け、友人とのやり取りに時間を割ける。AI の理想的な使い方ですね。おすすめです。\n\n## Replicate my setup?? If you dare!\n\n→ 同じ環境を作りたい？　やれるもんならどうぞ！\n\nI didn’t want to start fresh every time so I built a super simple Claude Code “directory.”\n\nIt has most of the things that you will need to handle triaging your inbox.\n\n→ 毎回ゼロからセットアップしたくなかったので、超シンプルな Claude Code の “ディレクトリ” を用意しました。受信箱仕分けに必要なものはひと通り入っています。\n\n```\n📁 .\n├── 📁 .claude\n│   ├── 📄 CLAUDE.md\n│   ├── 📄 settings.json\n│   └── 📁 skills\n│       ├── 📁 crm-management\n│       │   └── 📄 SKILL.md\n│       └── 📁 email-management\n│           └── 📄 SKILL.md\n├── 📄 .mcp.json\n```\n\nThere are a few important parts:\n\n→ 重要ポイントがいくつかあります。\n\n### The CLAUDE.md\n\nThis is highly personal (how do you manage YOUR inbox), and very important. The first thing I did was have Claude go through the past couple hundred emails I have sent, and develop a vibe for how I write emails. After a bit of back and forth, we have this:\n\n→ まずは CLAUDE.md。これは完全にパーソナル設定（あなたの受信箱をどう捌くか）で、超重要。最初に、過去数百通の送信メールを Claude に読ませて、自分のメールの “ノリ” をつかませました。やり取りの末、こんな感じに。\n\n```\n1. **Find the thread**: Search for the original email/thread to get context\n2. **Get thread details**: Retrieve the thread ID, message ID, AND recipient email address for proper threading\n3. **Check for calendar events**: If the email mentions an event, proactively check calendar and add it\n4. **Draft the email**:\n    - **CRITICAL**: Always explicitly provide the `To:` email address - the MCP tool does NOT auto-extract it from threads\n    - Keep it ultra-concise (but adjust based on context - some emails need warmth)\n    - Match Harper's voice (casual, direct, no fluff)\n    - No signatures or sign-offs\n5. **Always create as DRAFT**: Never send directly - always save as draft\n6. **Ensure proper threading**: When replying, use thread ID and in-reply-to message ID so the draft appears in the conversation thread\n7. **Iterate on feedback**: Harper will refine the wording - update the draft as needed\n```\n\n### The skills\n\nThen I went through and did a bunch of emails via Claude Code.

      "user_prompt": "# ORIGINAL TEXT\nOver the last week or so, I have been using Claude Code to help me with some email, and scheduling. It started cuz the holidays are overwhelming, and I felt like I was constantly behind. My inbox was overflowing with everything I had deemed important, and I hadn’t been able to make a dent. It was stressful. It still is!\n\n{{% figure src=\"R0002380.jpeg\" caption=\"Maybe a storm?, Ricoh GRiiix, 11/2025\" %}}\n\nI had just seen the [zo.computer](https://zo.computer) launch (neat project!) and it reminded me that [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) has this wild MCP server that you can use to connect to literally anything Pipedream supports. This means I could use it to do my emails! Problem solved. Problem created. More problems created! WHY ARE WE COUNTING PROBLEMS!\n\n## How? Why? HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT\n\nI love email. I really do. Typically I am really great at managing my email. However, when the email gets overwhelming - I end up ignoring it. Which means it gets worse. Which means everyone loses.\n\nI just need a way to start doing my email that is pretty low pressure. Using Claude Code has made it MUCH easier.\n\n1. I boot up a Claude Code session hooked to the proper MCP servers.\n2. I ask it to check my email\n3. It tells me what email is in my inbox that needs addressing (unread, then read email)\n4. Either offers to start fixing emails, or just starts writing drafts intelligently (checks my calendar, searches for context, etc).\n5. Says “We are done!”\n6. I go to my email client, and check the drafts. Edit and send most of them cuz they are great. Reject a few.\n7. Rinse Repeat\n8. Bacon\n\nBasically, I just have Claude Code check my email, and then pops out a message like “your brother emailed asking about thanksgiving plans” and I say “cool. Tell him we will be there, and will bring turkey juice or whatever you call stuffing” and then Claude Code will write an email that is approximately what I said but in the style it found from your past emails.\n\nI then specifically save it as a draft that I review heavily before sending.\n\n> I trust these agents to write code way way more than I trust them to write an email to a friend, stranger or business partner. It is pretty close, but not quite close enough to go yolo mode and let it send. Maybe soon? Or maybe a different email address? Who knows.\n\nIt works remarkably well. However, there are some gotchas\n\n### Funny story that isn’t so funny.\n\nA while back I was prototyping an email triaging agent with some code I had written, and it was working well but not great. A friend connected me to a person who was looking for someone to write a book about AI. The agent was like “this person wants to talk about writing a book about ai, they want a skeptical and academic perspective about AI’s impact” and I was like “I LOVE THIS. But this isn’t for me. I have some friends that would be good.” However, there was a bug, and the agent was drafting replies before getting feedback from me. And it ended up sending the previous draft that said very formally: “I would love to do this.”\n\nThe person excitedly replied and was like “let’s do this.”\n\nThat is when I found out that I fucked up. So I replied back and was like “well. My agents said yes for me before talking. Here is what I meant to say” and that person rightfully replied “**F U**”\n\n### You cannot trust these things.\n\nThis is why I am cautiously doing it again. Haha. This time I am way more careful, and the agent cannot send email only draft it. I am finding that I am editing every email - but only a little, and maybe less and less. Feels like a year ago with codegen.\n\nThus far it works pretty well. It allows me to get through a lot of email that I normally would ignore, giving me space to focus on the emails I really want to reply to. Basically it cleans up the cruft (vendors, services, etc) and allows me to hang out with my friends. Perfect AI usage.\n\nI recommend it.\n\n## Replicate my setup?? If you dare!\n\nI didn’t want to start fresh every time so I built a super simple Claude Code “directory.”\n\nIt has most of the things that you will need to handle triaging your inbox.\n\n```\n📁 .\n├── 📁 .claude\n│   ├── 📄 CLAUDE.md\n│   ├── 📄 settings.json\n│   └── 📁 skills\n│       ├── 📁 crm-management\n│       │   └── 📄 SKILL.md\n│       └── 📁 email-management\n│           └── 📄 SKILL.md\n├── 📄 .mcp.json\n```\n\nThere are a few important parts:\n\n### The CLAUDE.md\n\nThis is highly personal (how do you manage YOUR inbox), and very important. The first thing I did was have Claude go through the past couple hundred emails I have sent, and develop a vibe for how I write emails. After a bit of back and forth, we have this:\n\n```\n1. **Find the thread**: Search for the original email/thread to get context\n2. **Get thread details**: Retrieve the thread ID, message ID, AND recipient email address for proper threading\n3. **Check for calendar events**: If the email mentions an event, proactively check calendar and add it\n4. **Draft the email**:\n    - **CRITICAL**: Always explicitly provide the `To:` email address - the MCP tool does NOT auto-extract it from threads\n    - Keep it ultra-concise (but adjust based on context - some emails need warmth)\n    - Match Harper's voice (casual, direct, no fluff)\n    - No signatures or sign-offs\n5. **Always create as DRAFT**: Never send directly - always save as draft\n6. **Ensure proper threading**: When replying, use thread ID and in-reply-to message ID so the draft appears in the conversation thread\n7. **Iterate on feedback**: Harper will refine the wording - update the draft as needed\n```\n\n### The skills\n\nThen I went through and did a bunch of emails via Claude Code. It did ok. But I was able to coach it, and once it was in a good place I had it make a skill based on what we discovered together.\n\n```\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **Always draft, never send** - Save emails as drafts so Harper can review before sending\n2. **Threading is critical** - Replies must appear in the correct conversation thread\n3. **Match Harper's voice** - Ultra-concise, casual, no signatures\n4. **Extract structured data** - Pull event details, action items, contact info from emails\n```\n\nAnd\n\n```\n## Success Criteria\n\nYou've successfully handled email tasks when:\n- Drafts appear in correct conversation threads\n- Harper says \"looks good\" without needing changes\n- Calendar events are added proactively\n- Inbox summaries surface what matters\n- Process feels efficient and natural\n\n## Remember\n\nEmail is personal communication using Harper's voice. The goal is to save time while maintaining authentic, effective communication that sounds like Harper wrote it.\n\nWhen in doubt: shorter, more casual, and always draft first.\n```\n\nHaving Claude build its own skills is clutch. You really need to iterate to make it happen.\n\n### the tools!\n\nI am still mad about MCP as a concept, but not mad enough not to use it.\n\nThe goal is to simply give Claude Code a suite of tools that allows it to do its job well.\n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"pd\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2\"\n    },\n    \"pagen\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"pagen\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"toki\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"toki\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"chronicle\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"chronicle\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Pipedream\n\nThe [Pipedream MCP](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/developers) is very straight forward. You essentially add it to your Claude Code (works in other clients too), and then it will pop you through their auth. Once auth’d you add various services. Those services are then exposed as MCP tools. These are clutch. You can then use Claude to wire together some workflows.\n\nI currently use their Gmail, Google Calendar, and Contacts connections.\n\n### The others:\n\nI created 3 simple MCP servers that I wanted to exist:\n\n#### Toki\n\na super straight forward todo tracker on the CLI.

It is not perfect, but it does work nicely.\n\nI do recommend playing around with this. I would maybe be cautious about blindly trusting it.

It is early enough that we will start to see people like myself building bespoke and custom experiences that largely do what a product will do. Somehow Google will launch a version directly in gmail, that somehow doesn’t work. My guess is that the best versions will be like Mimestream or superhuman that are primarily agentic.

Bacon ※お約束の締めワード\n\n要するに、Claude Code が「兄貴から感謝祭の予定についてメールが来てるよ」と教えてくれるので、オレは「OK。“行くよ。ターキーの肉汁──要はスタッフィング的なやつ──を持っていく” と伝えて」と返すだけ。すると過去メールの文体を学習したうえで、ほぼそのままの下書きを作ってくれる。\n\nそして必ず「下書き」として保存し、送信前にガッツリ確認する。\n\n> コードを書かせるのは全然平気なんだけど、友だち・知らない人・ビジネス相手へのメールを丸投げするほどはまだ信用していない。あと一歩で YOLO モード（全部自動送信）に行けそうだけど、今はまだ。別アドレスで試すかも？　誰にも分からん。\n\nめちゃくちゃよく動く。ただし落とし穴もある。\n\n### 笑えない笑い話\n\n少し前、自作コードでメール仕分けエージェントを試作していた。そこそこ動くけど完璧とは言えないレベルだった。そんなとき友人が「AI に関する本を書ける人」を探している人物を紹介してくれた。エージェントは「AI の影響を懐疑的かつ学術的に論じられる著者を求めている」と要約。オレは「これ最高！ でも自分には向かない。適任の友だちがいるな」と思っていた。\n\nしかしバグがあって、エージェントがオレの確認前に下書きを作り、しかも送信までしてしまった。内容は超フォーマルに「ぜひ私にやらせてください」。\n\n相手は大喜びで「やりましょう！」。そこでオレは盛大にやらかしたと気づき、「すみません、エージェントが先走って『はい』と言いました。本当はこう言いたかったんです」と返信。相手からは当然の “**F U**”。\n\n### こいつらを完全には信用できない\n\nだから今回は慎重に再挑戦中。エージェントには「送信禁止・下書き専用」の権限しか与えていない。今のところ全メールを少しずつ編集しているが、その手直しはどんどん減ってきている。１年前のコード生成ブームと同じ感覚だ。\n\n今のところかなり快適。普段なら放置しがちなメールを一気に片付けてくれるので、本当に返信したいメールに集中できる。ベンダーやサービス系の雑草を刈り取り、友だちとのやり取りという花を守る──まさに AI の理想的な使い方。おすすめだ。\n\n## オレの環境を複製する？（勇者求む）\n\n毎回ゼロからセットアップしたくなかったので、超シンプルな Claude Code “ディレクトリ” を用意した。受信箱を仕分けるのに必要なものはほぼ入っている。\n\n```\n📁 .\n├── 📁 .claude\n│   ├── 📄 CLAUDE.md\n│   ├── 📄 settings.json\n│   └── 📁 skills\n│       ├── 📁 crm-management\n│       │   └── 📄 SKILL.md\n│       └── 📁 email-management\n│           └── 📄 SKILL.md\n├── 📄 .mcp.json\n```\n\nいくつか押さえるべきポイントがある。\n\n### CLAUDE.md\n\nここは超パーソナル（あなた自身の受信箱の捌き方）かつ超重要。まず過去数百通の送信メールを Claude に読ませ、オレの「メールのノリ」を掴ませた。あれこれやり取りした結果、今はこんな感じになっている。\n\n```\n1. **Find the thread**: 元メール／スレッドを検索して文脈をつかむ\n2. **Get thread details**: thread ID・message ID・宛先アドレスを取得して正しく紐付け\n3. **Check for calendar events**: イベントがあればカレンダーに追加\n4. **Draft the email**:\n    - **重要**: `To:` アドレスを必ず明示（MCP は自動抽出しない）\n    - とことん簡潔に（状況次第で温かみを追加）\n    - Harper の声を再現（カジュアル、直球、余計なフワフワ禁止）\n    - 署名・挨拶は不要\n5. **必ず下書き保存**: 直接送信しない\n6. **正しくスレッド化**: thread ID と in-reply-to message ID を必ず指定\n7. **フィードバックで更新**: Harper が修正→反映\n```\n\n### スキル\n\n大量のメールを処理しながらコーチングを重ね、いい感じになったところで Claude に “スキル” として固めさせた。\n\n```\n## コア原則\n\n1. **常に下書き、決して即送信しない**  \n2. **スレッド紐付けは生命線**  \n3. **Harper の声を厳守** ― 超簡潔・カジュアル・署名なし  \n4. **構造化データを抽出** ― イベント、アクション、連絡先など\n```\n\n```\n## 成功の判定基準\n\n- 下書きが正しいスレッドに入っている  \n- Harper が「いいね」と言って修正不要  \n- カレンダーが自動で更新されている  \n- 受信箱サマリーで重要なメールが浮き彫り  \n- 全体として効率的で自然に感じる\n```\n\n```\n## Remember\n\nEmail は Harper の声で行うパーソナルなコミュニケーション。時間を節約しつつ「本人っぽさ」を保つことが目標。  \n迷ったら：短く、ラフに、まず下書き。\n```\n\nClaude 自身にスキルを書かせるのはマジで神。とにかく反復が大事だ。\n\n### ツール！\n\nMCP という概念にはまだムカつくけど、便利すぎてやめられない。Claude Code にツール一式を渡すと仕事がはかどる。\n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"pd\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2\"\n    },\n    \"pagen\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"pagen\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"toki\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"toki\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"chronicle\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"chronicle\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Pipedream\n\n[Pipedream MCP](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/developers) は超シンプル。Claude Code に追加して認証を済ませ、各種サービスを追加すると MCP ツールとして使える。これがキモだ。オレは Gmail・Google Calendar・Contacts を接続中。\n\n### その他：自作 MCP サーバー３種\n\n#### Toki\nCLI ベースの超シンプルな TODO トラッカー（将来的に複数バックエンド対応予定。今はローカルのみ）。  \n- [harperreed/toki](https://github.com/harperreed/toki)  \n- `brew install harperreed/tap/toki`\n\n#### Chronicle\nエージェントの行動を全部ログに残すツール。「うちの子が何をしていたか」を把握できる。  \n- [harperreed/chronicle](https://github.com/harperreed/chronicle)  \n- `brew install harperreed/tap/chronicle`\n\n#### pagen\nCRM をうっかりミススペルした **p**ersonal **agen**t バックエンド。通信状況や人間関係を俯瞰するためのやつ。  \n- [harperreed/pagen](https://github.com/harperreed/pagen)  \n- `brew install harperreed/tap/pagen`\n\n### まとめ\n\n強力なスキル、CLAUDE.md、そして MCP ツールの三位一体で、メール仕分けがかなりラクになる。完璧ではないけど十分便利。試す価値はあるが、盲信は禁物。LOL\n\n## やってみる？\n\nこのセットアップ用にシンプルなプラグインを作った。インストールするだけで動くはず！\n\nインストール手順:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add harperreed/office-admin-claude\n/plugin install office-admin\n/setup-office-admin\n```\n\n※YMMV（Your Mileage May Vary＝結果は個人差あり）\n\n## これは間違いなく未来だ\n\n好きか嫌いかにかかわらず、エージェント型メールは来る。今は黎明期だから、オレみたいにプロダクト顔負けのカスタム体験を作る人が出てくるはずだ。Google も Gmail に直で機能をねじ込んでくるだろうが、たぶん微妙に動かない。ベストな体験は Mimestream や Superhuman のような “エージェント前提” クライアントだと思う。チャット UI だけになるのは勘弁だけど、さてどうなるか。\n\n大量のメールを抱えているならぜひ遊んでみてほしい。オレは雑草（ビジネスローンの勧誘メールなど）を刈って花（あなたたち）を守るための「brush clearing」として使っている。\n\n### プライバシー？ 何それ？\n\nメールは Pipedream と Anthropic を経由している。これは明らかにプライバシー上の懸念点だ。早くローカルで動かし、Google Workspace と直接やり取りできる MCP サーバーが欲しい！\n\n### 要注意\n\n{{% figure src=\"L1030630.jpeg\" caption=\"Not even once, Leica Q, 11/2017\" %}}\n\n他人に影響を与える権限をエージェントに渡すのは本当に怖い。オレの場合はうまく機能しているが、試行錯誤の中でいくつか盛大にやらかしたのも事実だ。\n\n受信箱はいま、ピッカピカ。DO NOT SEND ME EMAILS!

      "user_prompt": "# ORIGINAL TEXT\nOver the last week or so, I have been using Claude Code to help me with some email, and scheduling. It started cuz the holidays are overwhelming, and I felt like I was constantly behind. My inbox was overflowing with everything I had deemed important, and I hadn’t been able to make a dent. It was stressful. It still is!\n\n{{% figure src=\"R0002380.jpeg\" caption=\"Maybe a storm?, Ricoh GRiiix, 11/2025\" %}}\n\nI had just seen the [zo.computer](https://zo.computer) launch (neat project!) and it reminded me that [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) has this wild MCP server that you can use to connect to literally anything Pipedream supports. This means I could use it to do my emails! Problem solved. Problem created. More problems created! WHY ARE WE COUNTING PROBLEMS!\n\n## How? Why? HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT\n\nI love email. I really do. Typically I am really great at managing my email. However, when the email gets overwhelming - I end up ignoring it. Which means it gets worse. Which means everyone loses.\n\nI just need a way to start doing my email that is pretty low pressure. Using Claude Code has made it MUCH easier.\n\n1. I boot up a Claude Code session hooked to the proper MCP servers.\n2. I ask it to check my email\n3. It tells me what email is in my inbox that needs addressing (unread, then read email)\n4. Either offers to start fixing emails, or just starts writing drafts intelligently (checks my calendar, searches for context, etc).\n5. Says “We are done!”\n6. I go to my email client, and check the drafts. Edit and send most of them cuz they are great. Reject a few.\n7. Rinse Repeat\n8. Bacon\n\nBasically, I just have Claude Code check my email, and then pops out a message like “your brother emailed asking about thanksgiving plans” and I say “cool. Tell him we will be there, and will bring turkey juice or whatever you call stuffing” and then Claude Code will write an email that is approximately what I said but in the style it found from your past emails.\n\nI then specifically save it as a draft that I review heavily before sending.\n\n> I trust these agents to write code way way more than I trust them to write an email to a friend, stranger or business partner. It is pretty close, but not quite close enough to go yolo mode and let it send. Maybe soon? Or maybe a different email address? Who knows.\n\nIt works remarkably well. However, there are some gotchas\n\n### Funny story that isn’t so funny.\n\nA while back I was prototyping an email triaging agent with some code I had written, and it was working well but not great. A friend connected me to a person who was looking for someone to write a book about AI. The agent was like “this person wants to talk about writing a book about ai, they want a skeptical and academic perspective about AI’s impact” and I was like “I LOVE THIS. But this isn’t for me. I have some friends that would be good.” However, there was a bug, and the agent was drafting replies before getting feedback from me. And it ended up sending the previous draft that said very formally: “I would love to do this.”\n\nThe person excitedly replied and was like “let’s do this.”\n\nThat is when I found out that I fucked up. So I replied back and was like “well. My agents said yes for me before talking. Here is what I meant to say” and that person rightfully replied “**F U**”\n\n### You cannot trust these things.\n\nThis is why I am cautiously doing it again. Haha. This time I am way more careful, and the agent cannot send email only draft it. I am finding that I am editing every email - but only a little, and maybe less and less. Feels like a year ago with codegen.\n\nThus far it works pretty well. It allows me to get through a lot of email that I normally would ignore, giving me space to focus on the emails I really want to reply to. Basically it cleans up the cruft (vendors, services, etc) and allows me to hang out with my friends. Perfect AI usage.\n\nI recommend it.\n\n## Replicate my setup?? If you dare!\n\nI didn’t want to start fresh every time so I built a super simple Claude Code “directory.”\n\nIt has most of the things that you will need to handle triaging your inbox.\n\n```\n📁 .\n├── 📁 .claude\n│   ├── 📄 CLAUDE.md\n│   ├── 📄 settings.json\n│   └── 📁 skills\n│       ├── 📁 crm-management\n│       │   └── 📄 SKILL.md\n│       └── 📁 email-management\n│           └── 📄 SKILL.md\n├── 📄 .mcp.json\n```\n\nThere are a few important parts:\n\n### The CLAUDE.md\n\nThis is highly personal (how do you manage YOUR inbox), and very important. The first thing I did was have Claude go through the past couple hundred emails I have sent, and develop a vibe for how I write emails. After a bit of back and forth, we have this:\n\n```\n1. **Find the thread**: Search for the original email/thread to get context\n2. **Get thread details**: Retrieve the thread ID, message ID, AND recipient email address for proper threading\n3. **Check for calendar events**: If the email mentions an event, proactively check calendar and add it\n4. **Draft the email**:\n    - **CRITICAL**: Always explicitly provide the `To:` email address - the MCP tool does NOT auto-extract it from threads\n    - Keep it ultra-concise (but adjust based on context - some emails need warmth)\n    - Match Harper's voice (casual, direct, no fluff)\n    - No signatures or sign-offs\n5. **Always create as DRAFT**: Never send directly - always save as draft\n6. **Ensure proper threading**: When replying, use thread ID and in-reply-to message ID so the draft appears in the conversation thread\n7. **Iterate on feedback**: Harper will refine the wording - update the draft as needed\n```\n\n### The skills\n\nThen I went through and did a bunch of emails via Claude Code. It did ok. But I was able to coach it, and once it was in a good place I had it make a skill based on what we discovered together.\n\n```\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **Always draft, never send** - Save emails as drafts so Harper can review before sending\n2. **Threading is critical** - Replies must appear in the correct conversation thread\n3. **Match Harper's voice** - Ultra-concise, casual, no signatures\n4. **Extract structured data** - Pull event details, action items, contact info from emails\n```\n\nAnd\n\n```\n## Success Criteria\n\nYou've successfully handled email tasks when:\n- Drafts appear in correct conversation threads\n- Harper says \"looks good\" without needing changes\n- Calendar events are added proactively\n- Inbox summaries surface what matters\n- Process feels efficient and natural\n\n## Remember\n\nEmail is personal communication using Harper's voice. The goal is to save time while maintaining authentic, effective communication that sounds like Harper wrote it.\n\nWhen in doubt: shorter, more casual, and always draft first.\n```\n\nHaving Claude build its own skills is clutch. You really need to iterate to make it happen.\n\n### the tools!\n\nI am still mad about MCP as a concept, but not mad enough not to use it.\n\nThe goal is to simply give Claude Code a suite of tools that allows it to do its job well.\n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"pd\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2\"\n    },\n    \"pagen\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"pagen\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"toki\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"toki\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"chronicle\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"chronicle\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"mcp\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Pipedream\n\nThe [Pipedream MCP](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/developers) is very straight forward. You essentially add it to your Claude Code (works in other clients too), and then it will pop you through their auth. Once auth’d you add various services. Those services are then exposed as MCP tools. These are clutch. You can then use Claude to wire together some workflows.\n\nI currently use their Gmail, Google Calendar, and Contacts connections.\n\n### The others:\n\nI created 3 simple MCP servers that I wanted to exist:\n\n#### Toki\n\na super straight forward todo tracker on the CLI. The plan is to build out support for various backends. Currently it is just local.\n\nIt works as a cli app or as a mcp server:\n\nYou can try it out here:\n\n- [harperreed/toki](https://github.com/harperreed/toki)\n- `brew install harperreed/tap/toki`\n\n#### Chronicle\n\na log for agent actions. I want my agents to log what they have been up to!\n\nYou can try it out here:\n\n- [harperreed/chronicle](https://github.com/harperreed/chronicle)\n- `brew install harperreed/tap/chronicle`\n\n#### pagen\n\na misspelled crm that acts as my **p**ersonal **agen**t backend. This allows me to have reasonable understanding of where I am from a comms, etc standpoint\n\nYou can try it out here:\n\n- [harperreed/pagen](https://github.com/harperreed/pagen)\n- `brew install harperreed/tap/pagen`\n\n### Wrapping it together.\n\nThe robust skill, the claude.md and the MCP tools make this a pretty easy and helpful system for triaging email. It is not perfect, but it does work nicely.\n\nI do recommend playing around with this. I would maybe be cautious about blindly trusting it. Lol.\n\n## Wanna try it?!\n\nI made a simple plugin that should do this for you. All you gotta do is install it!\n\nInstallation Now:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add harperreed/office-admin-claude\n/plugin install office-admin\n/setup-office-admin\n```\n\nYMMV\n\n## This is obviously the future.\n\nWhether we like it or not, it appears that agentic email will be a thing. It is early enough that we will start to see people like myself building bespoke and custom experiences that largely do what a product will do. Somehow Google will launch a version directly in gmail, that somehow doesn’t work. My guess is that the best versions will be like Mimestream or superhuman that are primarily agentic. I hope it isn’t primarily chat - but we shall see.\n\nI do recommend playing with this. Especially if you have a lot of email that you need to take care of. I think of it as clearing brush. You don’t want to fuck up the flowers (all of you. you are my flowers), but you don’t mind cutting down the weeds (all of them! You can see the random emails about business loans lurking in the corners..)\n\n### Privacy, what privacy!!\n\nMy emails are going through Pipedream, and Anthropic. This is not ideal. it is obviously a privacy concern. I can't wait to run these things locally, and maybe have an MCP server that interacts directly with Google Suite.\n\n### Be cautious\n\n{{% figure src=\"L1030630.jpeg\" caption=\"Not even once, Leica Q, 11/2017\" %}}\n\nGiving your agents access to things that affect other people is scary and should be done with caution. It works pretty well for me, but I did totally fuck up a few situations trying this out.\n\nMy inbox is pristine. DO NOT SEND ME EMAILS! IT IS BEAUTIFUL!\n\n# CURRENT TRANSLATION\nここ１週間ほど、メールとスケジュールをさばくために Claude Code を使い倒している。ホリデーシーズンのゴタゴタに押しつぶされて「常に遅れっぱなし」という感覚が限界だったからだ。受信箱は “重要” マークを付けたメールでパンパン、まったく手が付けられない。ストレスは限界──いや、今も限界！\n\n{{% figure src=\"R0002380.jpeg\" caption=\"Maybe a storm?, Ricoh GRiiix, 11/2025\" %}}\n\nちょうど [zo.computer](https://zo.computer) のローンチ（ナイスなプロジェクト！）を見て、「そういえば [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) には、Pipedream がサポートするあらゆるサービスにつながるワイルドな MCP サーバーがあったな」と思い出した。──ということは、メールにも使えるじゃん！　問題解決！ ……と思いきや問題発生！ ……さらに問題が増殖！　WHY ARE WE COUNTING PROBLEMS!\n\n## How?

Bacon ※お約束の締めワード\n\n要するに、Claude Code が「兄貴から感謝祭の予定についてメールが来てるよ」と教えてくれるので、オレは「OK。“行くよ。ターキーの肉汁──要はスタッフィング的なやつ──を持っていく” と伝えて」と返すだけ。すると過去メールの文体を学習したうえで、ほぼそのままの下書きを作ってくれる。\n\nそして必ず「下書き」として保存し、送信前にガッツリ確認する。\n\n> コードを書かせるのは全然平気なんだけど、友だち・知らない人・ビジネス相手へのメールを丸投げするほどはまだ信用していない。あと一歩で YOLO モード（全部自動送信）に行けそうだけど、今はまだ。別アドレスで試すかも？　誰にも分からん。\n\nめちゃくちゃよく動く。ただし落とし穴もある。\n\n### 笑えない笑い話\n\n少し前、自作コードでメール仕分けエージェントを試作していた。そこそこ動くけど完璧とは言えないレベルだった。そんなとき友人が「AI に関する本を書ける人」を探している人物を紹介してくれた。エージェントは「AI の影響を懐疑的かつ学術的に論じられる著者を求めている」と要約。オレは「これ最高！ でも自分には向かない。適任の友だちがいるな」と思っていた。\n\nしかしバグがあって、エージェントがオレの確認前に下書きを作り、しかも送信までしてしまった。内容は超フォーマルに「ぜひ私にやらせてください」。\n\n相手は大喜びで「やりましょう！」。そこでオレは盛大にやらかしたと気づき、「すみません、エージェントが先走って『はい』と言いました。本当はこう言いたかったんです」と返信。相手からは当然の “**F U**”。\n\n### こいつらを完全には信用できない\n\nだから今回は慎重に再挑戦中。エージェントには「送信禁止・下書き専用」の権限しか与えていない。今のところ全メールを少しずつ編集しているが、その手直しはどんどん減ってきている。１年前のコード生成ブームと同じ感覚だ。\n\n今のところかなり快適。普段なら放置しがちなメールを一気に片付けてくれるので、本当に返信したいメールに集中できる。ベンダーやサービス系の雑草を刈り取り、友だちとのやり取りという花を守る──まさに AI の理想的な使い方。おすすめだ。\n\n## オレの環境を複製する？（勇者求む）\n\n毎回ゼロからセットアップしたくなかったので、超シンプルな Claude Code “ディレクトリ” を用意した。受信箱を仕分けるのに必要なものはほぼ入っている。\n\n```\n📁 .\n├── 📁 .claude\n│   ├── 📄 CLAUDE.md\n│   ├── 📄 settings.json\n│   └── 📁 skills\n│       ├── 📁 crm-management\n│       │   └── 📄 SKILL.md\n│       └── 📁 email-management\n│           └── 📄 SKILL.md\n├── 📄 .mcp.json\n```\n\nいくつか押さえるべきポイントがある。\n\n### CLAUDE.md\n\nここは超パーソナル（あなた自身の受信箱の捌き方）かつ超重要。まず過去数百通の送信メールを Claude に読ませ、オレの「メールのノリ」を掴ませた。あれこれやり取りした結果、今はこんな感じになっている。\n\n```\n1. **Find the thread**: 元メール／スレッドを検索して文脈をつかむ\n2. **Get thread details**: thread ID・message ID・宛先アドレスを取得して正しく紐付け\n3. **Check for calendar events**: イベントがあればカレンダーに追加\n4. **Draft the email**:\n    - **重要**: `To:` アドレスを必ず明示（MCP は自動抽出しない）\n    - とことん簡潔に（状況次第で温かみを追加）\n    - Harper の声を再現（カジュアル、直球、余計なフワフワ禁止）\n    - 署名・挨拶は不要\n5. **必ず下書き保存**: 直接送信しない\n6. **正しくスレッド化**: thread ID と in-reply-to message ID を必ず指定\n7. **フィードバックで更新**: Harper が修正→反映\n```\n\n### スキル\n\n大量のメールを処理しながらコーチングを重ね、いい感じになったところで Claude に “スキル” として固めさせた。\n\n```\n## コア原則\n\n1. **常に下書き、決して即送信しない**  \n2. **スレッド紐付けは生命線**  \n3. **Harper の声を厳守** ― 超簡潔・カジュアル・署名なし  \n4. **構造化データを抽出** ― イベント、アクション、連絡先など\n```\n\n```\n## 成功の判定基準\n\n- 下書きが正しいスレッドに入っている  \n- Harper が「いいね」と言って修正不要  \n- カレンダーが自動で更新されている  \n- 受信箱サマリーで重要なメールが浮き彫り  \n- 全体として効率的で自然に感じる\n```\n\n```\n## Remember\n\nEmail は Harper の声で行うパーソナルなコミュニケーション。時間を節約しつつ「本人っぽさ」を保つことが目標。  \n迷ったら：短く、ラフに、まず下書き。\n```\n\nClaude 自身にスキルを書かせるのはマジで神。とにかく反復が大事だ。\n\n### ツール！\n\nMCP という概念にはまだムカつくけど、便利すぎてやめられない。Claude Code にツール一式を渡すと仕事がはかどる。\n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"pd\": {\n      \"type\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2\"\n    },\n    \"pagen\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"pagen\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"toki\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"toki\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {}\n    },\n    \"chronicle\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"chronicle\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Pipedream\n\n[Pipedream MCP](https://pipedream.com/docs/connect/mcp/developers) は超シンプル。Claude Code に追加して認証を済ませ、各種サービスを追加すると MCP ツールとして使える。これがキモだ。オレは Gmail・Google Calendar・Contacts を接続中。\n\n### その他：自作 MCP サーバー３種\n\n#### Toki\nCLI ベースの超シンプルな TODO トラッカー（将来的に複数バックエンド対応予定。今はローカルのみ）。  \n- [harperreed/toki](https://github.com/harperreed/toki)  \n- `brew install harperreed/tap/toki`\n\n#### Chronicle\nエージェントの行動を全部ログに残すツール。「うちの子が何をしていたか」を把握できる。  \n- [harperreed/chronicle](https://github.com/harperreed/chronicle)  \n- `brew install harperreed/tap/chronicle`\n\n#### pagen\nCRM をうっかりミススペルした **p**ersonal **agen**t バックエンド。通信状況や人間関係を俯瞰するためのやつ。  \n- [harperreed/pagen](https://github.com/harperreed/pagen)  \n- `brew install harperreed/tap/pagen`\n\n### まとめ\n\n強力なスキル、CLAUDE.md、そして MCP ツールの三位一体で、メール仕分けがかなりラクになる。完璧ではないけど十分便利。試す価値はあるが、盲信は禁物。LOL\n\n## やってみる？\n\nこのセットアップ用にシンプルなプラグインを作った。インストールするだけで動くはず！\n\nインストール手順:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add harperreed/office-admin-claude\n/plugin install office-admin\n/setup-office-admin\n```\n\n※YMMV（Your Mileage May Vary＝結果は個人差あり）\n\n## これは間違いなく未来だ\n\n好きか嫌いかにかかわらず、エージェント型メールは来る。今は黎明期だから、オレみたいにプロダクト顔負けのカスタム体験を作る人が出てくるはずだ。Google も Gmail に直で機能をねじ込んでくるだろうが、たぶん微妙に動かない。ベストな体験は Mimestream や Superhuman のような “エージェント前提” クライアントだと思う。チャット UI だけになるのは勘弁だけど、さてどうなるか。\n\n大量のメールを抱えているならぜひ遊んでみてほしい。オレは雑草（ビジネスローンの勧誘メールなど）を刈って花（あなたたち）を守るための「brush clearing」として使っている。\n\n### プライバシー？ 何それ？\n\nメールは Pipedream と Anthropic を経由している。これは明らかにプライバシー上の懸念点だ。早くローカルで動かし、Google Workspace と直接やり取りできる MCP サーバーが欲しい！\n\n### 要注意\n\n{{% figure src=\"L1030630.jpeg\" caption=\"Not even once, Leica Q, 11/2017\" %}}\n\n他人に影響を与える権限をエージェントに渡すのは本当に怖い。オレの場合はうまく機能しているが、試行錯誤の中でいくつか盛大にやらかしたのも事実だ。\n\n受信箱はいま、ピッカピカ。DO NOT SEND ME EMAILS! IT IS BEAUTIFUL!\n\n# CRITIQUE FEEDBACK\n【総評】\n全体的に原文の内容とカジュアルな温度感はよく捉えていますが、所々で\n1) 英語のまま残っている見出し・キーワード、\n2) 原文にない補足・ツッコミの挿入、\n3) ニュアンスのずれ／過不足、\n4) 文体のぶれ（口語×解説調）、\n5) 技術用語の統一性\nが目立ちます。下記を修正すると “もともと日本語で書かれた記事” としてより自然かつ忠実になります。  \n\n──────────────────────  \n▼重大度：高（意味の欠落・過追加・誤訳）\n\n1. 未訳／英語のまま残存  \n   • 見出し「## How? Why? HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT」─丸ごと未訳。  \n     →「## どうして？ なぜ？ 人類は絶滅しかけている！」など。  \n   • コードブロック内のラベル  \n     「Core Principles」「Success Criteria」「Remember」  \n     「Find the thread」等も訳出すべき。コードとして実行される部分ではなくマニュアル文なので訳した方が自然。  \n   • bullet-8「Bacon」の脚注「※お約束の締めワード」は原文にない説明＝過追加。訳注を入れるなら【訳注】など明示し本文から分離。\n\n2. ニュアンスのずれ／過訳  \n   • “It started cuz the holidays are overwhelming”  \n     「ホリデーシーズンのゴタゴタに押しつぶされて『常に遅れっぱなし』という感覚が限界だったから」  \n       →“限界だった” は原文の “overwhelming”+“constantly behind” をやや誇張。  \n         「…で遅れ気味になっていたからだ」程度で十分。  \n   • “Problem solved. Problem created. More problems created! WHY ARE WE COUNTING PROBLEMS!”  \n     「問題解決！ ……と思いきや問題発生！ ……さらに問題が増殖！」  \n       →「Problem solved」を訳していない（「と思いきや」でスキップ）。  \n         「問題は解決！……いやむしろ発生！……どんどん増殖！」などで三段リズムを保持。  \n   • “agentic email” →「エージェント型メール」と訳したが他所では「agentic」を残置。用語を統一。\n\n3. 意味の欠落  \n   • “I felt like I was constantly behind” に対し「限界だった」を追加した結果、“常に遅れ気味” の事実＋気持ち→“behind” のニュアンスが減少。  \n   • “searches for context” →「文脈を検索」だと不自然。「関連情報を探す」等が自然。  \n\n──────────────────────  \n▼重大度：中（文体・語調の揺れ / 不自然さ）\n\n1. 一人称と文体  \n   • 「オレ」「マジで神」「ムカつくけど」など強めの男性口語がある一方、  \n     「要するに」「かつ」「超パーソナル」など中立語が混在。  \n     口語なら最後まで「だ」「である調」を避け、「だ」「です」を混ぜない。  \n   • “LOL” を日本語文内にそのまま置くより「笑」や「ｗ」で統一。\n\n2. 補足の挿入・説明口調  \n   • 「※お約束の締めワード」「（あなたたち）」など訳者の解説が本文に混ざる。  \n     →【訳注】として枠外に置くか削除。\n\n3. 比喩／スラングの温度  \n   • “Fuck up”→「やらかした」は自然。ただし「盛大にやらかした」と膨らませている。  \n     • “F U” の前の説明文が和らぎ過ぎるとインパクトが薄れる。  \n       例：「その人からは当然『F U（くたばれ）』と返事が来た。」など補足括弧で。\n\n──────────────────────  \n▼重大度：低（語法・用字・細部）\n\n1. 半角英数と全角のゆれ  \n   • 「MCP tool」「thread ID」といった技術語は半角英数で統一し、周辺は全角。  \n2. 句読点・長音  \n   • 「──」多用で字面が賑やか。読点・カンマで一部置換するとリズムが安定。  \n3. カタカナ表記の統一  \n   • 「エージェント」「エージェント型」／「エージェント的」など揺れ。  \n4. “メール捌き” は俗語。連発すると読者によっては抵抗感あり。「メール処理」に一度置換し頻度を下げる。\n\n──────────────────────  \n▼技術用語・固有名詞\n\n1. triage / triaging →「トリアージ」「仕分け」どちらかに統一。  \n2. Pagedream →「Pipedream」とミスがないか再確認。  \n3. MCP server →「MCPサーバー」等、表記ゆれをなくす。\n\n──────────────────────  \n▼提案：修正例（抜粋）\n\n● 見出し\n❌ ## How? Why? HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT  \n✅ ## どうして？ なぜ？ そして人類は絶滅に向かっている（冗談だけど）\n\n● 問題カウント部\n❌ 問題解決！ ……と思いきや問題発生！ ……さらに問題が増殖！  \n✅ 問題は解決！ …と思ったら今度は問題発生！ …しかもどんどん増える！ なんで数えてるんだ！\n\n● bullet-8\n❌ 8.

      "Severe / Critical Issues (must-fix first)\n----------------------------------------\n1. Large blocks left completely untranslated  \n   • Under the subsections **Toki / Chronicle / pagen** the explanatory sentences remain in English (“a super straight forward todo tracker on the CLI …”, “a log for agent actions …” etc.).  \n   • Phrases such as “It works as a cli app or as a mcp server:” are also still English.  \n   → Translate these paragraphs fully or, if kept intentionally, mark them as quotations.\n\n2. Partial-translation mix that changes register mid-sentence  \n   ex) “CLI ベースのシンプルな todo トラッカー。将来は複数バックエンドを想定。Currently it is just local.”  \n   → Either translate the final sentence or keep the whole description in English as a block quote; do not mix.\n\n3. Mistranslation of “turkey juice or whatever you call stuffing”  \n   • “ターキージュース（詰め物みたいなやつ？）” introduces a non-existent concept (juice).  \n   • Suggestion: 「ターキーのスタッフィング（詰め物）みたいなやつ」or 「スタッフィング（ターキーの詰め物）」.\n\n4. Heading “HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT”  \n   • 現訳: 「人類が絶滅しかけてるのに」 – loses the manic all-caps urgency and comedic tone.  \n   • Consider: 「人類が死に絶えようとしているのに!!」or keep the caps: 「HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT」。\n\n5. Figure caption “Not even once” → 「ダメ、絶対」  \n   • “ダメ、絶対” is a Japanese anti-drug slogan; carries a very specific public-service tone not present in the original.  \n   • Safer: 「一度も、絶対に」or transliterate: 「Not even once」。\n\nMajor Issues (nuance, tone, style)\n----------------------------------\n1. Repeated softening of profanity / edgy tone  \n   • “fuck up the flowers” → 「傷つけず」 removes the humourous vulgarity.  \n   • “I fucked up” → 「ミス」 / 「大事故」 softens impact.  \n   Decide whether the target register allows mild profanity (例: 「やらかした」, 「盛大にやらかした」) to keep voice consistency.\n\n2. “ストレス MAX” & other katakana slang  \n   • Feels internet-slangy and can date quickly. Consider 「ストレスはマックス」or plain 「かなりのストレス」depending on readership.\n\n3. “ベーコン（お約束）”  \n   • Japanese readers may not catch the meme “Bacon”. Brief gloss or footnote could help, e.g. 「8. ベーコン（ジョークの定番）」.\n\n4. Inconsistent rendering of technical terms  \n   • “skill(s)” sometimes left in English, sometimes rendered as スキル. Pick one and stick to it.  \n   • “agentic email” → 「エージェント型メール」など統一を。\n\n5. “YOLO モード” / “ノーフラフ” etc.  \n   • Hybrid coinages. Either leave plain English or give a concise Japanese equivalent (“YOLO モード(勢いだけで送信するモード)”, “余計な装飾なし”).\n\nMinor / Stylistic / Readability\n-------------------------------\n1. Excessive punctuation & emoji-like spacing (“！　” etc.). Tighten to standard Japanese typography.  \n2. Occasional half-width / full-width mismatch (thread ID／message ID).  \n3. Some casual rhetorical questions end with “?” but Japanese normally uses 「？」— unify.  \n4. “YMMV” explained but inside parentheses. Could add 日本語訳＋“(※環境により結果は異なります)” and keep YMMV in Roman.\n\nOmissions / Additions\n---------------------\n• No major additions detected.  \n• Minor omission: “Haha.” after “cautiously doing it again” was dropped; could keep a brief 「笑」 to preserve voice.\n\nMachine-like / Over-literal Spots\n---------------------------------\n• Bullet translations strictly mirror English word order – sometimes choppy.  \n  Example: “Find the thread: オリジナルのスレッドを検索して文脈をつかむ” sounds okay, but “Get thread details: …正しくスレッド化” feels literal; could rewrite: 「…スレッドが正しく紐付くように各種 ID と宛先を取得する」.\n\n• Repetitive “〜のは〜です” patterns. Vary sentence structure for natural flow.\n\nSummary of Key Fixes\n--------------------\n1. Translate the remaining English blocks (Toki / Chronicle / pagen sections, stray sentences).  \n2. Correct the “turkey juice / stuffing” line.  \n3. Re-evaluate tone: retain mild profanity & manic style where appropriate; avoid unnecessary softening.  \n4. Standardise terminology (スキル, エージェント, MCP など).  \n5. Polish typography and mixed-language expressions for smoother Japanese.\n\nAddressing the above will bring the translation much closer to a faithful, lively text that feels natively written in Japanese.",
      "総評  \n翻訳全体としては原文の口語的・軽いトーンをかなりうまく再現しており、大きな誤訳は少ないものの、細部を見ると「意味の取りこぼし」「ニュアンスの欠落」「情報の追加／削除」「不自然な言い回し」「トーンのぶれ」が散見される。以下にカテゴリ別・重要度別で指摘する。\n\n────────────────\n【Critical / 意味を損なう重大な誤訳・欠落】\n1. Step 4 のニュアンス欠落  \n　原文: “Either offers to start fixing emails, or just starts writing drafts intelligently”  \n　訳: “文脈を調べつつ下書きを自動作成（カレンダー確認なども）”  \n　→「自動でメールの修正を提案するか、下書きを書き始めるか」という二択が訳から消えている。「修正案を提示する」という動作も入れるべき。\n\n2. Thanksgiving 例のギャグ弱体化  \n　原文: “we will bring turkey juice or whatever you call stuffing”  \n　訳: “スタッフィング（ターキーの詰め物）っぽいものを持って行く”  \n　→“turkey juice” のわざとズレた言い方が消えている。ユーモアが弱まるので「ターキージュース的な何か（つまりスタッフィング？）」など遊びを残すべき。\n\n3. “HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT” 未訳  \n　見出しのインパクトが英語のまま。読者が英語に慣れていない場合は意味が伝わらない。「人類絶滅中」といった直訳＋英語併記が望ましい。\n\n4. “working well but not great” の省略  \n　エージェント試作時の状態説明が抜け、完成度がイマイチだったニュアンスが消えている。\n\n────────────────\n【Major / ニュアンス・トーンのずれ、情報追加・削除】\n1. “Bacon” の訳注  \n　原文は「8. Bacon」という完全な内輪ギャグ。訳で「（ジョークの定番）」と補足したが、余計な説明を足したぶん軽さが損なわれる。訳注を入れるなら脚注や括弧の外で。\n\n2. “Rinse Repeat” 未訳  \n　口語表現を残すか訳すか一貫性が必要。「おかわり」「同じ手順を繰り返す」のように訳＋英語併記も可。\n\n3. “Haha.” の位置変更  \n　原文冒頭の “Haha.” を末尾に「笑」と移動。位置が変わるとテンポが変わる。\n\n4. “I’m still mad about MCP as a concept” →「モヤります」  \n　「モヤる」はかなり口語スラング。筆者のカジュアルさに合うが、やや世代依存。冗談交じりの怒りを示す “mad” を「ムカつくけど」などにすると忠実。\n\n5. “editor” という勝手な補足  \n　原文は “a person”。「編集者」という役職を訳者が補っている。意訳としては自然だが、厳密には情報追加。\n\n────────────────\n【Minor / 文体・語法・表記ゆれ】\n1. 句読点ゆれ  \n　全角カンマと全角読点・三点リーダ（…）・ダッシュ（――）が混在。統一する。\n\n2. “超○○” の多用  \n　“超簡潔”“超シンプル” など口語感を出しているが連発すると稚拙に見える箇所も。“めちゃくちゃ” “すごく” などバリエーションを。\n\n3. “YOLO モード”“YMMV”  \n　アルファベットのまま残しているが、初出で軽い訳注「行き当たりばったり（YOLO）」「個人差あり（YMMV）」を添えると親切。\n\n4. “草刈り” メタファ  \n　訳は「雑草を刈って花を守る」で問題ないが、「ブラシを払う（clearing brush）」のニュアンスを一言添えるとより忠実。\n\n────────────────\n【Stylistic / 自然さ・読みやすさ】\n1. 「ストレスはマックス。いや、今もストレスです！」  \n　勢いは出ているが「ストレスはピーク。今もだけど。」程度でも自然。\n\n2. 「これは本当に強力」など強調語がやや多い  \n　原文のテンションを再現しつつも、重複を少し削ると読みやすい。\n\n3. 「ツールをそろえてやるだけで仕事がはかどります」  \n　「やる」を削り「ツールをそろえるだけで～」の方がスムーズ。\n\n────────────────\n【Technical / 用語の統一】\n1. “thread ID” “message ID”  \n　途中で “in-reply-to message ID” は英語のまま。カタカナにするか括弧付き訳語（スレッドID／メッセージID）で統一を。\n\n2. “draft”→「下書き」／“send”→「送信”  \n　ほぼ統一されているが一部のコードブロック内は英語。コード片として残す場合と、説明文内で訳す場合を区別する方針を明示。\n\n────────────────\n【Omissions / その他抜けている細部】\n・図キャプション “Maybe a storm?” “Not even once” などはそのまま。写真文脈を考えると括弧内に和訳を添えても良い。  \n・“WHY ARE WE COUNTING PROBLEMS!” の “WHY” 強調は訳でも再現できる（例: 「なぜ問題を数えてるんだ！」）。\n\n────────────────\n【改善提案まとめ】\n・重大な欠落部分（Step 4 の二択／turkey juice ギャグ／未訳見出し）を補う。  \n・説明的な勝手注釈は最小限に。  \n・口語スラングを残しつつ、重複語・表記ゆれを整理。  \n・英語残し or 全訳の方針を節ごとに統一し、必要なら併記。  \n・ユーモア（誤字・ズレ・意味の二重性）を意識して訳語を工夫。\n\n以上を修正すれば、原文の「軽妙さ・自虐・技術オタク感」を保ちつつ、より正確で自然な日本語になる。",
      "徹底レビュー ― 問題点と改良案  \n（オリジナル英語と提示された日本語訳を逐語対照し、重大度順に整理）\n\n────────────────────\n【Critical / 要修正優先】\n1. 省略・情報欠落  \n   • “and it was working well but not great.” が訳文から完全に欠落  \n     →「そこそこ動いてはいたものの、完璧ではありませんでした」などを追加。  \n   • “It is obviously a privacy concern.” の「プライバシーの懸念」は訳文で落ちている  \n     →「これは明らかにプライバシー上の懸念点です」を補う。  \n   • “These are clutch.”（これが決め手）未訳（英語のまま）→「これが不可欠／キモ」等に。  \n\n2. 誤訳・意味のズレ  \n   • “Typically I am really great at managing my email.”  \n     「わりとうまくさばける」では弱い。原文は “really great”。  \n     →「普段はメールさばきが得意」程度に強める。  \n   • “problem solved / created” のカジュアルトーンがやや硬い。  \n     →「問題解決！ ……いや新たな問題発生！ …さらに増殖！」など語調を合わせる。  \n   • “Humans are dying and going extinct”  \n     「人類絶滅中」だけだと “dying” が落ちている。「人類が死につつあり絶滅しかけている！」等で誇張感を残す。  \n\n3. 技術用語・一貫性  \n   • “skills” を一部「スキル」とカタカナで訳し、一部は英語のまま。  \n   • “threading” →「スレッド紐付け」「スレッディング」など表記統一を。  \n   • “agentic email” は「エージェント型メール」と訳す箇所・原文ママが混在。  \n\n────────────────────\n【Major / 大きな改善余地】\n1. 口語トーンの再現  \n   原文はかなりくだけた blog 口語。訳文はやや丁寧に寄り、勢いが弱い。  \n   例) “I LOVE THIS.” →「これ最高！」など感嘆を大文字相当の強い表現で。  \n\n2. 異文化ジョーク・語感  \n   • “Bacon” をそのまま残すと日本語読者に？？  \n     →脚注か「お約束の “Bacon”」など補足。  \n   • “turkey juice or whatever you call stuffing”  \n     「ターキージュース的な何か（つまりスタッフィング？）」は不自然。  \n     →「ターキーの肉汁…要はスタッフィングみたいなやつ」等に。  \n\n3. 機械訳臭・不自然な語順  \n   • 「メール、大好きです。本当に。」→「私はメールが大好きだ。本当に。」  \n   • 「ツールたち」「ディレクトリ」は不統一な擬似複数形。  \n   • 英語原文のインライン強調 (caps, !!!) を日本語側で「！」やカタカナで再現しきれていない箇所あり。  \n\n────────────────────\n【Minor / 細部調整】\n• 半角スペースの多用（「Claude Code セッション」など）は読みづらい。  \n• 「ハハ。」より「笑」か「ハハッ」の方が口語。  \n• 「パンパン」は人によっては口語すぎる。文脈で良いが要検討。  \n• “clutch” をカタカナで「クラッチ」と残すと誤解。→「神」「決め手」等。  \n• “Your Mileage May Vary” の注釈がない。→脚注で補足可。  \n• コードブロック前後の説明に直訳臭。「簡素なTODOトラッカー」など自然な和文に。  \n\n────────────────────\n【Stylistic / トーン・文体】\n• 原文は一人称「I」で読者にタメ口。訳文は「です／ます」混在。  \n  方向性を決めて統一（砕けたブログなら常体「だ・である」＋口語が自然）。  \n• 擬音・大文字・スラング（YOLO, F U, LOL など）の熱量を、  \n  カタカナや全角英字、読点の増減で再現すると読みやすい。  \n\n────────────────────\n【Suggested re-translation samples】（抜粋）\n\n▼欠落部分補完  \n少し前、自作コードでメール仕分けエージェントを試作していて――それなりに動くけど、完璧とは言えない程度でした。\n\n▼ニュアンス強化  \n普段はメール捌きなんて朝飯前なんだけど、量が爆発するとつい放置してしまい、余計ひどくなる──その悪循環。\n\n▼スラング再現  \nコードを書かせるのは全然平気だけど、友だちや取引先へのメールを任せるとなるとまだ YOLO は無理。もうちょい、あと一歩って感じ。\n\n────────────────────\n【総評】\n\n大きな破綻や機械翻訳特有の直訳は少なく、情報量もほぼ原文相当。ただし  \n• 一部省略／誤訳  \n• 口語・勢い・ジョークの再現不足  \n• 用語の揺れ・英語残し  \nが目立つ。  \n上記 Critical & Major を潰しつつ、文体を「砕けた常体」か「ですます」のどちらかに統一すれば、「最初から日本語で書かれたブログ」へかなり近づく。",
      "【総評】\n全体的に原文の内容とカジュアルな温度感はよく捉えていますが、所々で\n1) 英語のまま残っている見出し・キーワード、\n2) 原文にない補足・ツッコミの挿入、\n3) ニュアンスのずれ／過不足、\n4) 文体のぶれ（口語×解説調）、\n5) 技術用語の統一性\nが目立ちます。下記を修正すると “もともと日本語で書かれた記事” としてより自然かつ忠実になります。  \n\n──────────────────────  \n▼重大度：高（意味の欠落・過追加・誤訳）\n\n1. 未訳／英語のまま残存  \n   • 見出し「## How? Why? HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT」─丸ごと未訳。  \n     →「## どうして？ なぜ？ 人類は絶滅しかけている！」など。  \n   • コードブロック内のラベル  \n     「Core Principles」「Success Criteria」「Remember」  \n     「Find the thread」等も訳出すべき。コードとして実行される部分ではなくマニュアル文なので訳した方が自然。  \n   • bullet-8「Bacon」の脚注「※お約束の締めワード」は原文にない説明＝過追加。訳注を入れるなら【訳注】など明示し本文から分離。\n\n2. ニュアンスのずれ／過訳  \n   • “It started cuz the holidays are overwhelming”  \n     「ホリデーシーズンのゴタゴタに押しつぶされて『常に遅れっぱなし』という感覚が限界だったから」  \n       →“限界だった” は原文の “overwhelming”+“constantly behind” をやや誇張。  \n         「…で遅れ気味になっていたからだ」程度で十分。  \n   • “Problem solved. Problem created. More problems created! WHY ARE WE COUNTING PROBLEMS!”  \n     「問題解決！ ……と思いきや問題発生！ ……さらに問題が増殖！」  \n       →「Problem solved」を訳していない（「と思いきや」でスキップ）。  \n         「問題は解決！……いやむしろ発生！……どんどん増殖！」などで三段リズムを保持。  \n   • “agentic email” →「エージェント型メール」と訳したが他所では「agentic」を残置。用語を統一。\n\n3. 意味の欠落  \n   • “I felt like I was constantly behind” に対し「限界だった」を追加した結果、“常に遅れ気味” の事実＋気持ち→“behind” のニュアンスが減少。  \n   • “searches for context” →「文脈を検索」だと不自然。「関連情報を探す」等が自然。  \n\n──────────────────────  \n▼重大度：中（文体・語調の揺れ / 不自然さ）\n\n1. 一人称と文体  \n   • 「オレ」「マジで神」「ムカつくけど」など強めの男性口語がある一方、  \n     「要するに」「かつ」「超パーソナル」など中立語が混在。  \n     口語なら最後まで「だ」「である調」を避け、「だ」「です」を混ぜない。  \n   • “LOL” を日本語文内にそのまま置くより「笑」や「ｗ」で統一。\n\n2. 補足の挿入・説明口調  \n   • 「※お約束の締めワード」「（あなたたち）」など訳者の解説が本文に混ざる。  \n     →【訳注】として枠外に置くか削除。\n\n3. 比喩／スラングの温度  \n   • “Fuck up”→「やらかした」は自然。ただし「盛大にやらかした」と膨らませている。  \n     • “F U” の前の説明文が和らぎ過ぎるとインパクトが薄れる。  \n       例：「その人からは当然『F U（くたばれ）』と返事が来た。」など補足括弧で。\n\n──────────────────────  \n▼重大度：低（語法・用字・細部）\n\n1. 半角英数と全角のゆれ  \n   • 「MCP tool」「thread ID」といった技術語は半角英数で統一し、周辺は全角。  \n2. 句読点・長音  \n   • 「──」多用で字面が賑やか。読点・カンマで一部置換するとリズムが安定。  \n3. カタカナ表記の統一  \n   • 「エージェント」「エージェント型」／「エージェント的」など揺れ。  \n4. “メール捌き” は俗語。連発すると読者によっては抵抗感あり。「メール処理」に一度置換し頻度を下げる。\n\n──────────────────────  \n▼技術用語・固有名詞\n\n1. triage / triaging →「トリアージ」「仕分け」どちらかに統一。  \n2. Pagedream →「Pipedream」とミスがないか再確認。  \n3. MCP server →「MCPサーバー」等、表記ゆれをなくす。\n\n──────────────────────  \n▼提案：修正例（抜粋）\n\n● 見出し\n❌ ## How? Why? HUMANS ARE DYING AND GOING EXTINCT  \n✅ ## どうして？ なぜ？ そして人類は絶滅に向かっている（冗談だけど）\n\n● 問題カウント部\n❌ 問題解決！ ……と思いきや問題発生！ ……さらに問題が増殖！  \n✅ 問題は解決！ …と思ったら今度は問題発生！ …しかもどんどん増える！ なんで数えてるんだ！\n\n● bullet-8\n❌ 8. Bacon ※お約束の締めワード  \n✅ 8. Bacon（ベーコン）  \n※訳注：原文のお決まりのオチとして「Bacon」とだけ書いている。\n\n──────────────────────  \n【まとめ】\n細部の未訳・過訳と文体のぶれを修正し、補足コメントを本文から切り離せば完成度は大幅に上がります。特に  \n・英語のまま残したラベル／見出しは全訳  \n・訳者コメントを排除または訳注化  \n・一人称／スラングのトーンを統一  \n・技術用語の一貫性  \nを徹底してください。"
