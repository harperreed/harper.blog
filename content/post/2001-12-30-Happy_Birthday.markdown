excerpt: Yesterday was kinnera's birthday. Lets all say happy Birthday to her.  Tonight
  I went to a shoddy rock show and saw a guy who used to play with the smashing pumpkins.
  It was wierd because members of the "pumpkins" were at the show. Often when I see
  famous people it takes me a little while t figure out that they are real. I guess
  that is what I get for living in a fantasy world. Well gnight ...

Yesterday was kinnera's birthday. Lets all say happy Birthday to her. <br/> Tonight I went to a shoddy rock show and saw a guy who used to play with the smashing pumpkins. It was wierd because members of the "pumpkins" were at the show. Often when I see famous people it takes me a little while t figure out that they are real. I guess that is what I get for living in a fantasy world. Well gnight all. Happy Birthday to Kinnera..
