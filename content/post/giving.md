A few friends have asked where they should send their money to better help support black lives and our local chicago communities.

## To my friends who are white (it  me!)

These are somethign that have helped me recently. 

* [Elements of white middle class dominance culture](/assets/Elements-of-White-Middle-Class-Dominant-Culture.pdf) also [here](https://www.stevebozzone.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Elements-of-White-Middle-Class-Dominant-Culture.pdf) - read this and learn how we fuck up meetings, work places and organizations with our own misplaced norms. Learn and be better

* [White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard For White People To Talk About Racism](https://robindiangelo.com/publications/) - but this book. 

* [Opportunities for White People in the Fight for Racial Justice](https://www.whiteaccomplices.org/)

Remember why we are here. We are here because black lives matter. That is it. Simple. 

**GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY.**
