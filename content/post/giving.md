A few friends have asked where they should send their money to better help support black lives and our local chicago communities. 

This is a list of places that we have supported and I think you should too. 

Remember, the key is to give them your money. A lot of it. Over and over again.

# To my friends who are white (it  me!)

These are somethign that have helped me recently. 

* [Elements of white middle class dominance culture](/assets/Elements-of-White-Middle-Class-Dominant-Culture.pdf) (also [here](https://www.stevebozzone.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Elements-of-White-Middle-Class-Dominant-Culture.pdf)) - read this and learn how we fuck up meetings, work places and organizations with our own misplaced norms. Learn and be better

* [White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard For White People To Talk About Racism](https://robindiangelo.com/publications/) - buy this book. 

* [Opportunities for White People in the Fight for Racial Justice](https://www.whiteaccomplices.org/) - Lots of resources for white people to help support racial justice. 

* [It’s Time We Dealt With White Supremacy in Tech](https://marker.medium.com/its-time-we-dealt-with-white-supremacy-in-tech-8f7816fe809) - READ THIS IF YOU ARE A LEADER.




Remember why we are here. We are here because black lives matter. That is it. Simple. 

**GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY.**
