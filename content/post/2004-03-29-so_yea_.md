tonight was nice. we <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1080542019-Nokia6600(065).jpg">played games</a>. ate <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1080536183-Nokia6600%28063%29.jpg">some food</a>. hung out. it was nice. I finally got to spend time with all my friends - in a more chill out way. it was nice. I am tired. but in that "i slept until 1ish" sort of way. I need to sleep. get up. unfortunantly goto work. and do lots of work. then I will get food. hang out with carl. hang out with morgan. etc. I really like morgan ;) I am super glad things have worked out for the better. it is nice. <br/><br/>i seriously do not understand <a href="http://www.nata2.info/?path=pictures%2Fmisc%2Fphone_camera%2Fphotolog&img=1080428506-Nokia6600(047).jpg">this</a>. wtf. <br/><br/>the world is going to hell.. btw.
