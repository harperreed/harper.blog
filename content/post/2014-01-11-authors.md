I read a lot. I am also vocal about what I am reading. This morning I was asked to recommend a few authors/books. I decided to write down the authors I recommend the most. 

In no order (other than alphabetical by first name. lol): 

* [Alastair Reynolds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Reynolds)
* [Charles Stross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross)
* [China meiville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_meiville)

* [William Hertling](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=William+Hertling)

Read these authors. Enjoy them. Have fun.

I also have a [constantly updated list](https://harperreed.com/books/authors/) of all of the authors I have read. 

If you are looking for something else, I would suggest this [list of books](https://docs.google.com/a/nata2.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjuRpKKTHJltdEp2WDJSN0hmYWlaeXRSOFRzbWk1T1E&usp=sharing#gid=0) that [my brother crowdsourced on twitter](http://www.dylanreed.com/2013/12/30/book-em-dylo/). It is quite good. 

Read more books.
