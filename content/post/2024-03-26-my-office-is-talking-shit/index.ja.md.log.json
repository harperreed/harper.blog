      "user_prompt": "**tl;dr:** _I use a bunch of sensors, and an LLM to make my office talk to us about what’s going on in the office. This is a long post, but should be pretty straight forward. Generally, this is a good demonstration of how I have been using LLMs in my real life._\n\nIn 2019 my buddy Ivan and I started working in this [amazing studio](https://company.lol) here in Chicago. Mostly we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\nEarly on, one of the main things I spent my time building was adding some sensors and automation to the office. My goal was to have insight into the environment, etc of the office at any time.\n\nWe used [home assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) to collect all the sensors into one platform. I built some really boring automations that would announce various states.\n\nThe notifications were pretty straight forward:\n\n- Announcing when a person arrived\n- Announcing when the temperature is too hot, too cold\n- Announcing when the CO2 level is too high\n- Making a noise when the door is open or closed (convenience store door noise)\n\nWe pushed the notifications to a slack and a an old google home speaker with the mic disabled. The speaker worked well and sounds pretty good. We placed it about 12 feet up, in the very middle of the space - so it sounds like it is coming from everywhere. If you are looking for an “notification speaker,” these are pretty solid.\n\nHere is an example of the notifications:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nAs you can see it is effective, but pretty boring.\n\nThe notifications were super helpful when we were in the office, and even more helpful when we were gone. In the beginning of Covid when nobody knew anything, it was nice to be able to monitor the state of the office remotely.\n\nWhile in the office, the announcements and various other ambient notifications made the office feel futuristic. Like the office knew what was going on and had a bit of personality.\n\nWe had no idea what was coming next...\n\n## The json-singularity is here.\n\nWe all know now that this LLM revolution is fucking everything up, and probably will make most knowledge work weird, wild, fun and complicated over the next few years.\n\nWhen GPT-3 was released in 2020, I immediately started building weird software to use it. I started thinking a lot about how to use this technology in my every day. I built lots of “bots.” Most of them had a very “personal” tone to their output.\n\nMy favorite \"emergent\" trick is to take structured `JSON` data and convert it to **prose** via the LLM. When I say prose, I don't mean poems. I mean words and sentences.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\nSpecifically I take json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nThen add a fun prompt:\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nPass it to `GPT-4-turbo` and get this:\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nPretty straight forward. What is really great, is that you don’t have to pre-define the json object. The llm is able to be **very** flexible. For instance, let’s just randomly add another entity to the json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the llm will reply with no change to the prompt:\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nThis is effectively magic. ;)\n\nNow weave it all together with a simple python or node app, and BAM - you have a bot that will tell you what to wear every morning based on structured weather data that you don’t have to be careful about.\n\nHilariously, when building this type of app - if there is an error, the LLM will interpret the error with the same prompt:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nI use this pattern constantly. I mostly build lil bots that hang out and tell me things:\n\n- Sleep performance analysis\n- Weather bot\n- [Chicago Alerts twitter account](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- Sensor decisions for my e-ink ambient displays\n\n(_Never fear, I will document all of these later._)\n\n## Back to the office\n\nIn early 2023 my company was spiraling and I started spending a lot of time hacking on projects to clear my mind. I also started spending a lot more deliberate time in my office with the team. The limitations of the previous iteration of state based automatons started to show.\n\nArmed with this new paradigm, and a sudden influx of time, I decided to redo the notifications in the office.\n\nFirst, I prototyped the system by catching the sensor data and manually sending it to ChatGPT and seeing how it would react. It was pretty straight forward, and obviously very prompt dependent.\n\nHere is the first prompt we used\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n\n```\n\nI would pass in the default state so the Llm would know what status quo was, then I would pass in the current state, and as a wild card I passed in the last state.\n\nFor instance if this was a door:\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” } `\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nThe LLM may reply:\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\nIt saw that there isn’t a change, and told us the state. If we close the door, the llm says:\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nThis was really compelling. Kind of annoying, but compelling!\n\nNow it was time to pass a WHOLE bunch of signals to the LLM and see what happens.\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nThe main problem with this approach is that you don’t want an announcement every time a sensor changes. Since our goal was to make something better than the state based approach from 2019, we needed to group the sensors.\n\nI decided to make a really simple flask app that ultimately just collected json data from sensors over MQTT and then after a certain set of parameters (time, velocity and count) it would push bunch of the json states into one payload.\n\nThe objects look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nWhich would translate into:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFrom here it is passed to Openai to turn this json into prose:\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nThis all happens via my friend, and yours: `mqtt`.\n\nI then have a home assistant send that sends sensor changes down the wire to be collected and transformed.\n\nFast change Automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nAs you can see, both of these require that the office is “occupied” for the automation to fire. Since it costs money to generate the responses, I don’t want it to be talking about air quality when we are gone ;)\n\nI have two automations because some states are slow (air quality, physical space presence), and some are fast (personal presence, doors, AC, etc).\n\nThe automations are pretty simple: They look for state change, and then push the state change to the mqtt topic.\n\nThis works surprisingly well. Since it a home assistant automation, I can add any home assistant sensor to the agent and it will chat about it.\n\nI also have the prompt broken out separately so I can iterate on it without having to restart the entire stack. This is super helpful when you are tuning the sarcasm for your office.\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nOnce this was all built and working I decided that I wanted the office to see. As I type this, it seems like maybe it is a bad idea. However, it is hilarious.\n\nI wrote a really stupid piece of code that triggers with a motion sensor, grabs a snapshot from a security camera, and then hits a box running LLAVA and then returns json of what was on the security camera at the time of motion.\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\nThis works surprisingly well.\n\nThen I just push this json into the sensor collector and have it act like another sensor.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhich will result in:\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nThe agent can see! This added another level:\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\nQuickly followed by:\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\nAnother example where it talked about clothing:\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## All together now\n\nOnce this was all wired together we had magical experiences like this when I left the office the other day:\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nAnd now our office discord (no more slack?!) looks like this:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"The discord is popping\">}}\n\nWe are constantly iterating on the prompt and the sensors to get it to sit between annoying and funny. It is a wafer thin line.\n\nBecause the system is expecting a json payload, it is really easy to extend the agent to react to other sensors.\n\n**Hearing is next**\n\n## Codes! You can run this yourself.\n\nAll of the code is open source. It isn't pretty, and isn't mostly written by LLM. But it works well.\n\nThe code that does the sensor grabbing / LLM funny stuff here: [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)\n\nThe code for the eyeballs are here: [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\nI imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless. This code has been running without many tweaks for the last 6-8 months. It is constantly hilarious and always brings a smile to us occupants and a “wtf” from our visitor friends. If you do take a swing at it - let me know. Also, if you have any trouble, send me an [email](mailto:harper@modest.com) and maybe I can help!\n\nMy prediction is that this will be doable inside of home assistant shortly.\n\n**Part 2 will drop later. I will update yall on how we used a vtuber rig to give the agent a body**",
      "response": "**tl;dr:** _たくさんのセンサーとLLMを組み合わせ、オフィスが「いま何が起きているか」をしゃべってくれるようにしました。長い記事ですが内容は単純明快で、私がリアルライフでLLMをどう活用しているかを示す良いデモになっています。_\n\n2019年、友人のIvanと私はシカゴのこの[最高のスタジオ](https://company.lol)で仕事を始めました。ほぼ毎日好き勝手に面白いものを作っています。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\n最初期に私が取り組んだのは、オフィスにセンサーと自動化を仕込むことでした。いつでも環境などの状態を把握できるようにするのが目的です。\n\n私たちは[Home Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant)を使って、すべてのセンサーを一つのプラットフォームに集約しました。そしていくつかの（正直退屈な）オートメーションを書き、状態をアナウンスさせました。\n\n通知はこんな感じでした:\n\n- 人が到着したときのアナウンス\n- 温度が高すぎる／低すぎるときのアナウンス\n- CO₂レベルが高すぎるときのアナウンス\n- ドアが開閉したときの音（コンビニのドアチャイム）\n\n通知はSlackと、マイクを無効にした古い Google Home スピーカーへ送っていました。このスピーカーは音が良く、天井から約3.5mの中央に設置したので「どこからともなく聞こえる」感じになります。“通知用スピーカー”としてはかなり優秀です。\n\nHere is an example of the notifications:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nご覧のとおり、実用的ではありますがかなり退屈です。\n\nオフィスにいるときはもちろん、外出中にも通知はとても役立ちました。Covid初期で何も分からなかった頃、リモートでオフィスの状態を確認できるのは安心材料でした。\n\nオフィス内にいるときは、アナウンスや環境音的な通知のおかげで未来感があり、まるでオフィスが状況を把握し人格を持っているかのようでした。\n\nこれから起きることなんて、まったく想像していませんでした……\n\n## jsonシンギュラリがやってきた\n\n今やLLM革命がすべてをぶち壊し、数年のうちにナレッジワークを奇妙でワイルドかつ面倒で楽しいものにするのは間違いありません。\n\n2020年にGPT-3がリリースされるや否や、私はすぐに変わり種ソフトを作り始め、日常でどう使えるかを考え倒しました。結果として“ボット”を大量に作り、その多くはかなり“パーソナル”なトーンでしゃべります。\n\n私が一番気に入っている「副産物的」テクは、構造化された`JSON`データをLLMで**文章**に変換させることです。ここで言う文章は詩ではなく、普通の文・センテンスです。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\n具体的には、こんなjsonを\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\n次のような楽しいプロンプトと一緒に投げます:\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nそして`GPT-4-turbo`から\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nが返ってくる、というわけです。\n\nとてもシンプル。しかも事前にjsonオブジェクトを厳密に決めておく必要がありません。LLMは**めちゃくちゃ**柔軟です。たとえば適当に要素を増やしても――\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nプロンプトはそのままでも\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nのように対応してくれます。\n\nこれは実質マジックです。 ;)\n\nあとはPythonやNodeで軽くラップすれば、構造化天気データを気にせず「毎朝今日の服装を教えてくれるボット」が完成します。\n\nさらには、エラーが発生してもLLMは同じプロンプトでエラー内容を解釈してくれます:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nこのパターンを私は常用しています。主にこんな小ボットを作りました:\n\n- 睡眠パフォーマンス解析\n- 天気ボット\n- [Chicago Alerts Twitter アカウント](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- 電子ペーパーのアンビエント表示に使うセンサー判定\n\n(_これらは後日ちゃんとドキュメント化します。_)\n\n## オフィスに話を戻そう\n\n2023年初頭、会社がスパイラル状態だったので頭を切り替える目的でハック作業に没頭し、オフィスにも意識的にいる時間が増えました。すると2019年の状態ベース自動化では限界が見えてきました。\n\n新しいパラダイムと、急に増えた時間を武器に、オフィス通知を作り直すことにしました。\n\nまずはセンサーデータを捕まえて手作業でChatGPTに投げ、その反応を観察するプロトタイプを作成。結果は当然ながらプロンプト依存でした。\n\n最初に使ったプロンプトがこちら:\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n...\n```\n\ndefault stateで基準値を渡し、current stateに現在の状態、さらにlast stateもおまけで与えました。\n\nたとえばドアの場合:\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nLLMの返答は\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\nのようになります。状態変化がないと判断しているわけです。ドアを閉めれば\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nと返してきます。\n\nめちゃくちゃ面白い――ちょっとウザいけど、かなり魅力的です。\n\n次は大量のシグナルを一気にLLMへ送り込む番です。\n\n## センサーをまとめて送る\n\nこの方式の課題は「センサーが変わるたびにアナウンスされたくない」点です。2019年版を超えるためには、センサーイベントをグループ化する必要がありました。\n\nそこでMQTT経由でセンサーjsonを集め、一定の条件（時間・変化速度・件数）が揃ったらまとめて1ペイロードにして送るシンプルなFlaskアプリを作成しました。\n\nオブジェクトはこんな形です:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nまとまると\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nこれをOpenAIに投げて文章に変換すると\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nとなります。\n\nすべてはご存じ`mqtt`のおかげで動いています。\n\nHome Assistant側では、センサーの状態変化を拾ってMQTTへ流すオートメーションを組んでいます。\n\nFast change Automation:\n\n```yaml\n...\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\n...\n```\n\n見てのとおり、いずれもオフィスが「occupied」のときだけ発火します。返答生成にはお金がかかるので、留守中に空気質を実況されても困りますからね ;)\n\nオートメーションを2種類に分けたのは、空気質や部屋の在席検知は遅い変化、個人の在席やドア・ACなどは速い変化と、性質が違うためです。\n\nやっていることは単純で、状態変化を検知したらMQTTトピックに投げるだけ。Home Assistantのセンサーなら何でも追加できるので拡張も楽ちんです。\n\nさらにプロンプトは別ファイルに分け、スタックを再起動せずに“皮肉の度合い”を微調整できるようにしました。\n\n## でも、目を付けたらどうなる？\n\n仕組みが動いたところで「オフィスに“目”を持たせたい」と思いました。今書いていても若干ヤバい気がしますが、笑えるので良し。\n\nモーションセンサーでトリガーし、防犯カメラのスナップショットを取得、それをLLAVAを動かしている箱に送り、結果をjsonで返す超単純コードを書きました。\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\nこれが意外にちゃんと動きます。\n\n得られたjsonを単なる追加センサーとしてMQTTに流し込むだけです。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo.

      "user_prompt": "# ORIGINAL TEXT\n**tl;dr:** _I use a bunch of sensors, and an LLM to make my office talk to us about what’s going on in the office. This is a long post, but should be pretty straight forward. Generally, this is a good demonstration of how I have been using LLMs in my real life._\n\nIn 2019 my buddy Ivan and I started working in this [amazing studio](https://company.lol) here in Chicago. Mostly we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\nEarly on, one of the main things I spent my time building was adding some sensors and automation to the office. My goal was to have insight into the environment, etc of the office at any time.\n\nWe used [home assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) to collect all the sensors into one platform. I built some really boring automations that would announce various states.\n\nThe notifications were pretty straight forward:\n\n- Announcing when a person arrived\n- Announcing when the temperature is too hot, too cold\n- Announcing when the CO2 level is too high\n- Making a noise when the door is open or closed (convenience store door noise)\n\nWe pushed the notifications to a slack and a an old google home speaker with the mic disabled. The speaker worked well and sounds pretty good. We placed it about 12 feet up, in the very middle of the space - so it sounds like it is coming from everywhere. If you are looking for an “notification speaker,” these are pretty solid.\n\nHere is an example of the notifications:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nAs you can see it is effective, but pretty boring.\n\nThe notifications were super helpful when we were in the office, and even more helpful when we were gone. In the beginning of Covid when nobody knew anything, it was nice to be able to monitor the state of the office remotely.\n\nWhile in the office, the announcements and various other ambient notifications made the office feel futuristic. Like the office knew what was going on and had a bit of personality.\n\nWe had no idea what was coming next...\n\n## The json-singularity is here.\n\nWe all know now that this LLM revolution is fucking everything up, and probably will make most knowledge work weird, wild, fun and complicated over the next few years.\n\nWhen GPT-3 was released in 2020, I immediately started building weird software to use it. I started thinking a lot about how to use this technology in my every day. I built lots of “bots.” Most of them had a very “personal” tone to their output.\n\nMy favorite \"emergent\" trick is to take structured `JSON` data and convert it to **prose** via the LLM. When I say prose, I don't mean poems. I mean words and sentences.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\nSpecifically I take json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nThen add a fun prompt:\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nPass it to `GPT-4-turbo` and get this:\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nPretty straight forward. What is really great, is that you don’t have to pre-define the json object. The llm is able to be **very** flexible. For instance, let’s just randomly add another entity to the json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the llm will reply with no change to the prompt:\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nThis is effectively magic. ;)\n\nNow weave it all together with a simple python or node app, and BAM - you have a bot that will tell you what to wear every morning based on structured weather data that you don’t have to be careful about.\n\nHilariously, when building this type of app - if there is an error, the LLM will interpret the error with the same prompt:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nI use this pattern constantly. I mostly build lil bots that hang out and tell me things:\n\n- Sleep performance analysis\n- Weather bot\n- [Chicago Alerts twitter account](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- Sensor decisions for my e-ink ambient displays\n\n(_Never fear, I will document all of these later._)\n\n## Back to the office\n\nIn early 2023 my company was spiraling and I started spending a lot of time hacking on projects to clear my mind. I also started spending a lot more deliberate time in my office with the team. The limitations of the previous iteration of state based automatons started to show.\n\nArmed with this new paradigm, and a sudden influx of time, I decided to redo the notifications in the office.\n\nFirst, I prototyped the system by catching the sensor data and manually sending it to ChatGPT and seeing how it would react. It was pretty straight forward, and obviously very prompt dependent.\n\nHere is the first prompt we used\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n\n```\n\nI would pass in the default state so the Llm would know what status quo was, then I would pass in the current state, and as a wild card I passed in the last state.\n\nFor instance if this was a door:\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” } `\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nThe LLM may reply:\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\nIt saw that there isn’t a change, and told us the state. If we close the door, the llm says:\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nThis was really compelling. Kind of annoying, but compelling!\n\nNow it was time to pass a WHOLE bunch of signals to the LLM and see what happens.\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nThe main problem with this approach is that you don’t want an announcement every time a sensor changes. Since our goal was to make something better than the state based approach from 2019, we needed to group the sensors.\n\nI decided to make a really simple flask app that ultimately just collected json data from sensors over MQTT and then after a certain set of parameters (time, velocity and count) it would push bunch of the json states into one payload.\n\nThe objects look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nWhich would translate into:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFrom here it is passed to Openai to turn this json into prose:\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nThis all happens via my friend, and yours: `mqtt`.\n\nI then have a home assistant send that sends sensor changes down the wire to be collected and transformed.\n\nFast change Automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nAs you can see, both of these require that the office is “occupied” for the automation to fire. Since it costs money to generate the responses, I don’t want it to be talking about air quality when we are gone ;)\n\nI have two automations because some states are slow (air quality, physical space presence), and some are fast (personal presence, doors, AC, etc).\n\nThe automations are pretty simple: They look for state change, and then push the state change to the mqtt topic.\n\nThis works surprisingly well. Since it a home assistant automation, I can add any home assistant sensor to the agent and it will chat about it.\n\nI also have the prompt broken out separately so I can iterate on it without having to restart the entire stack. This is super helpful when you are tuning the sarcasm for your office.\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nOnce this was all built and working I decided that I wanted the office to see. As I type this, it seems like maybe it is a bad idea. However, it is hilarious.\n\nI wrote a really stupid piece of code that triggers with a motion sensor, grabs a snapshot from a security camera, and then hits a box running LLAVA and then returns json of what was on the security camera at the time of motion.\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\nThis works surprisingly well.\n\nThen I just push this json into the sensor collector and have it act like another sensor.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhich will result in:\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nThe agent can see! This added another level:\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\nQuickly followed by:\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\nAnother example where it talked about clothing:\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## All together now\n\nOnce this was all wired together we had magical experiences like this when I left the office the other day:\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nAnd now our office discord (no more slack?!) looks like this:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"The discord is popping\">}}\n\nWe are constantly iterating on the prompt and the sensors to get it to sit between annoying and funny. It is a wafer thin line.\n\nBecause the system is expecting a json payload, it is really easy to extend the agent to react to other sensors.\n\n**Hearing is next**\n\n## Codes! You can run this yourself.\n\nAll of the code is open source. It isn't pretty, and isn't mostly written by LLM. But it works well.\n\nThe code that does the sensor grabbing / LLM funny stuff here: [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)\n\nThe code for the eyeballs are here: [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\nI imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless. This code has been running without many tweaks for the last 6-8 months. It is constantly hilarious and always brings a smile to us occupants and a “wtf” from our visitor friends. If you do take a swing at it - let me know. Also, if you have any trouble, send me an [email](mailto:harper@modest.com) and maybe I can help!\n\nMy prediction is that this will be doable inside of home assistant shortly.\n\n**Part 2 will drop later. I will update yall on how we used a vtuber rig to give the agent a body**\n\n# TRANSLATED TEXT\n**tl;dr:** _たくさんのセンサーとLLMを組み合わせ、オフィスが「いま何が起きているか」をしゃべってくれるようにしました。長い記事ですが内容は単純明快で、私がリアルライフでLLMをどう活用しているかを示す良いデモになっています。_\n\n2019年、友人のIvanと私はシカゴのこの[最高のスタジオ](https://company.lol)で仕事を始めました。ほぼ毎日好き勝手に面白いものを作っています。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\n最初期に私が取り組んだのは、オフィスにセンサーと自動化を仕込むことでした。いつでも環境などの状態を把握できるようにするのが目的です。\n\n私たちは[Home Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant)を使って、すべてのセンサーを一つのプラットフォームに集約しました。そしていくつかの（正直退屈な）オートメーションを書き、状態をアナウンスさせました。\n\n通知はこんな感じでした:\n\n- 人が到着したときのアナウンス\n- 温度が高すぎる／低すぎるときのアナウンス\n- CO₂レベルが高すぎるときのアナウンス\n- ドアが開閉したときの音（コンビニのドアチャイム）\n\n通知はSlackと、マイクを無効にした古い Google Home スピーカーへ送っていました。このスピーカーは音が良く、天井から約3.5mの中央に設置したので「どこからともなく聞こえる」感じになります。“通知用スピーカー”としてはかなり優秀です。\n\nHere is an example of the notifications:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nご覧のとおり、実用的ではありますがかなり退屈です。\n\nオフィスにいるときはもちろん、外出中にも通知はとても役立ちました。Covid初期で何も分からなかった頃、リモートでオフィスの状態を確認できるのは安心材料でした。\n\nオフィス内にいるときは、アナウンスや環境音的な通知のおかげで未来感があり、まるでオフィスが状況を把握し人格を持っているかのようでした。\n\nこれから起きることなんて、まったく想像していませんでした……\n\n## jsonシンギュラリがやってきた\n\n今やLLM革命がすべてをぶち壊し、数年のうちにナレッジワークを奇妙でワイルドかつ面倒で楽しいものにするのは間違いありません。\n\n2020年にGPT-3がリリースされるや否や、私はすぐに変わり種ソフトを作り始め、日常でどう使えるかを考え倒しました。結果として“ボット”を大量に作り、その多くはかなり“パーソナル”なトーンでしゃべります。\n\n私が一番気に入っている「副産物的」テクは、構造化された`JSON`データをLLMで**文章**に変換させることです。ここで言う文章は詩ではなく、普通の文・センテンスです。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\n具体的には、こんなjsonを\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\n次のような楽しいプロンプトと一緒に投げます:\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nそして`GPT-4-turbo`から\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nが返ってくる、というわけです。\n\nとてもシンプル。しかも事前にjsonオブジェクトを厳密に決めておく必要がありません。LLMは**めちゃくちゃ**柔軟です。たとえば適当に要素を増やしても――\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nプロンプトはそのままでも\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nのように対応してくれます。\n\nこれは実質マジックです。 ;)\n\nあとはPythonやNodeで軽くラップすれば、構造化天気データを気にせず「毎朝今日の服装を教えてくれるボット」が完成します。\n\nさらには、エラーが発生してもLLMは同じプロンプトでエラー内容を解釈してくれます:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nこのパターンを私は常用しています。主にこんな小ボットを作りました:\n\n- 睡眠パフォーマンス解析\n- 天気ボット\n- [Chicago Alerts Twitter アカウント](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- 電子ペーパーのアンビエント表示に使うセンサー判定\n\n(_これらは後日ちゃんとドキュメント化します。_)\n\n## オフィスに話を戻そう\n\n2023年初頭、会社がスパイラル状態だったので頭を切り替える目的でハック作業に没頭し、オフィスにも意識的にいる時間が増えました。すると2019年の状態ベース自動化では限界が見えてきました。\n\n新しいパラダイムと、急に増えた時間を武器に、オフィス通知を作り直すことにしました。\n\nまずはセンサーデータを捕まえて手作業でChatGPTに投げ、その反応を観察するプロトタイプを作成。結果は当然ながらプロンプト依存でした。\n\n最初に使ったプロンプトがこちら:\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n...\n```\n\ndefault stateで基準値を渡し、current stateに現在の状態、さらにlast stateもおまけで与えました。\n\nたとえばドアの場合:\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nLLMの返答は\n\n> No new updates, folks.

      "response": "**tl;dr:** _たくさんのセンサーと LLM を組み合わせ、オフィスが「いま何が起きているか」をしゃべってくれるようにしました。記事は長いですが内容はシンプル。私が実生活で LLM をどう活用しているかの良いデモになっています。_\n\n2019 年、友人の Ivan と私はシカゴのこの [最高のスタジオ](https://company.lol) で仕事を始めました。ほぼ毎日、好き勝手に面白いものを作っています。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\n最初期に私が取り組んだのは、オフィスにセンサーと自動化を仕込むことでした。いつでも環境などの状態を把握できるようにするのが目的です。\n\n私たちは [Home Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) を使い、すべてのセンサーを 1 つのプラットフォームに集約しました。そして（正直かなり退屈な）オートメーションを書き、状態をアナウンスさせました。\n\n通知はこんな感じでした:\n\n- 人が到着したときのアナウンス  \n- 温度が高すぎる／低すぎるときのアナウンス  \n- CO₂ レベルが高すぎるときのアナウンス  \n- ドアが開閉したときの音（コンビニのドアチャイム）\n\n通知は Slack と、マイクを無効にした古い Google Home スピーカーへ送っていました。このスピーカーは音が良く、天井中央の高さ約 3.5 m に設置したので「どこからともなく聞こえる」感じになります。“通知用スピーカー”としてはかなり優秀です。\n\n通知の例はこちら:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nご覧のとおり、実用的ではありますがかなり退屈です。\n\nオフィスにいるときはもちろん、外出中にも通知はとても役立ちました。COVID 初期で何もわからなかった頃、リモートでオフィスの状態を確認できるのは大きな安心材料でした。\n\nオフィス内にいるときは、アナウンスや環境音的な通知のおかげで未来感があり、まるでオフィスが状況を把握し人格を持っているかのようでした。\n\nこれから起きることなんて、まったく想像していませんでした……\n\n## json シンギュラリティがやってきた\n\nいまや LLM 革命がすべてをぶち壊し、数年のうちにナレッジワークを奇妙でワイルド、そして楽しくも面倒なものにしていくのは間違いありません。\n\n2020 年に GPT-3 がリリースされるや否や、私はすぐに変わり種ソフトを作り始め、日常でどう使えるかを考え倒しました。結果として“ボット”を大量に作り、その多くはかなり“パーソナル”なトーンでしゃべります。\n\n私のお気に入りの「副次的」テクニックは、構造化された `JSON` データを LLM で **文章**に変換させることです。ここで言う文章は詩ではなく、普通の文です。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\n具体的には、こんな JSON を\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\n次のような楽しいプロンプトと一緒に投げます:\n\n> What should I wear? Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear.\n\n`GPT-4-turbo` からは\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nと返ってきます。\n\nとてもシンプル。しかも JSON オブジェクトを厳密に決めておく必要がありません。LLM は **めちゃくちゃ** 柔軟です。たとえば要素を適当に増やしても――\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nプロンプトはそのままでも\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nのように対応してくれます。\n\nこれは実質マジックです。 ;)\n\nあとは Python や Node で軽くラップすれば、構造化天気データを気にせず「毎朝今日の服装を教えてくれるボット」が完成します。\n\nしかも、エラーが発生しても LLM は同じプロンプトでエラー内容を解釈してくれます:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nこのパターンを私は常用しています。主にこんな小ボットを作りました:\n\n- 睡眠パフォーマンス解析  \n- 天気ボット  \n- [Chicago Alerts Twitter アカウント](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)  \n- 電子ペーパーのアンビエント表示用センサー判定  \n\n(_これらは後日ちゃんとドキュメント化します。_)\n\n## オフィスに話を戻そう\n\n2023 年初頭、会社がスパイラル状態だったので頭を切り替える目的でハック作業に没頭し、オフィスにも意識的にいる時間が増えました。すると 2019 年の状態ベース自動化では限界が見えてきました。\n\n新しいパラダイムと、急に増えた時間を武器に、オフィス通知を作り直すことにしました。\n\nまずはセンサーデータを捕まえて手作業で ChatGPT に投げ、その反応を観察するプロトタイプを作成。結果は当然ながらプロンプト依存でした。\n\n最初に使ったプロンプトがこちら:\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are an AI that controls a house, similar to Jarvis in the Iron Man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple English what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise—tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is the state of the house\nwithout any activity or movement. You will then get a current state—what is\nhappening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the CO₂ and air quality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain English. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S. Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n```\n\ndefault state で基準値を渡し、current state に現在の状態、さらに last state もおまけで与えました。\n\nたとえばドアの場合:\n\n- default_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"closed\" }`  \n- current_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`  \n- last_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`\n\nLLM の返答は:\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\n状態変化がないと判断しているわけです。ドアを閉めれば\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nと返してきます。\n\nめちゃくちゃ面白い――ちょっとウザいけど、かなり魅力的です。\n\n次は大量のシグナルを一気に LLM へ送り込む番です。\n\n## センサーをまとめて送る\n\nこの方式の課題は「センサーが変わるたびにアナウンスされたくない」点です。2019 年版を超えるためには、センサーイベントをグループ化する必要がありました。\n\nそこで MQTT 経由でセンサー JSON を集め、一定の条件（時間・変化速度・件数）がそろったらまとめて 1 ペイロードにして送るシンプルな Flask アプリを作成しました。\n\nオブジェクトはこんな形です:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nまとまると\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nこれを OpenAI に投げて文章に変換すると\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nとなります。\n\nすべてはご存じ `mqtt` のおかげで動いています。\n\nHome Assistant では、センサーの状態変化を拾って MQTT へ流すオートメーションを組んでいます。\n\nFast change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n  - platform: state\n    entity_id:\n      - input_boolean.occupied\n      - lock.front_door\n      - binary_sensor.front_door\n      - switch.ac\n    for:\n      seconds: 5\ncondition:\n  - condition: state\n    entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n    state: \"on\"\naction:\n  - service: mqtt.publish\n    data:\n      qos: 0\n      retain: false\n      topic: hassevents/notifications\n      payload_template: |\n        {\n          \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n          \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n          \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n          \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n        }\nmode: single\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n  - platform: state\n    entity_id:\n      - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n      - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n      - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n      - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n      - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n      - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n    for:\n      minutes: 5\ncondition:\n  - condition: state\n    entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n    state: \"on\"\naction:\n  - service: mqtt.publish\n    data:\n      qos: 0\n      retain: false\n      topic: hassevents/notifications\n      payload_template: |\n        {\n          \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n          \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n          \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n          \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n        }\nmode: single\n```\n\n見てのとおり、いずれもオフィスが「occupied」のときだけ発火します。返答生成にはお金がかかるので、留守中に空気質を実況されても困りますからね ;)\n\nオートメーションを 2 種類に分けたのは、空気質や部屋の在席検知は遅い変化、個人の在席やドア・AC などは速い変化と、性質が違うためです。\n\nプロンプトは別ファイルに分けてあるので、スタックを再起動せずに“皮肉の度合い”を微調整できます。\n\n## でも、目を付けたらどうなる？\n\n仕組みが動いたところで「オフィスに“目”を持たせたい」と思いました。今書いていても少しヤバい気がしますが、笑えるので良し。\n\nモーションセンサーでトリガーし、防犯カメラのスナップショットを取得、それを LLAVA を動かしている箱に送り、結果を JSON で返す超単純コードを書きました。\n\n```python\n# (Missing code here)\n```\n\nこれが意外にちゃんと動きます。\n\n得られた JSON を単なる追加センサーとして MQTT に流し込むだけです。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone.

      "user_prompt": "# ORIGINAL TEXT\n**tl;dr:** _I use a bunch of sensors, and an LLM to make my office talk to us about what’s going on in the office. This is a long post, but should be pretty straight forward. Generally, this is a good demonstration of how I have been using LLMs in my real life._\n\nIn 2019 my buddy Ivan and I started working in this [amazing studio](https://company.lol) here in Chicago. Mostly we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\nEarly on, one of the main things I spent my time building was adding some sensors and automation to the office. My goal was to have insight into the environment, etc of the office at any time.\n\nWe used [home assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) to collect all the sensors into one platform. I built some really boring automations that would announce various states.\n\nThe notifications were pretty straight forward:\n\n- Announcing when a person arrived\n- Announcing when the temperature is too hot, too cold\n- Announcing when the CO2 level is too high\n- Making a noise when the door is open or closed (convenience store door noise)\n\nWe pushed the notifications to a slack and a an old google home speaker with the mic disabled. The speaker worked well and sounds pretty good. We placed it about 12 feet up, in the very middle of the space - so it sounds like it is coming from everywhere. If you are looking for an “notification speaker,” these are pretty solid.\n\nHere is an example of the notifications:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nAs you can see it is effective, but pretty boring.\n\nThe notifications were super helpful when we were in the office, and even more helpful when we were gone. In the beginning of Covid when nobody knew anything, it was nice to be able to monitor the state of the office remotely.\n\nWhile in the office, the announcements and various other ambient notifications made the office feel futuristic. Like the office knew what was going on and had a bit of personality.\n\nWe had no idea what was coming next...\n\n## The json-singularity is here.\n\nWe all know now that this LLM revolution is fucking everything up, and probably will make most knowledge work weird, wild, fun and complicated over the next few years.\n\nWhen GPT-3 was released in 2020, I immediately started building weird software to use it. I started thinking a lot about how to use this technology in my every day. I built lots of “bots.” Most of them had a very “personal” tone to their output.\n\nMy favorite \"emergent\" trick is to take structured `JSON` data and convert it to **prose** via the LLM. When I say prose, I don't mean poems. I mean words and sentences.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\nSpecifically I take json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nThen add a fun prompt:\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nPass it to `GPT-4-turbo` and get this:\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nPretty straight forward. What is really great, is that you don’t have to pre-define the json object. The llm is able to be **very** flexible. For instance, let’s just randomly add another entity to the json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the llm will reply with no change to the prompt:\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nThis is effectively magic. ;)\n\nNow weave it all together with a simple python or node app, and BAM - you have a bot that will tell you what to wear every morning based on structured weather data that you don’t have to be careful about.\n\nHilariously, when building this type of app - if there is an error, the LLM will interpret the error with the same prompt:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nI use this pattern constantly. I mostly build lil bots that hang out and tell me things:\n\n- Sleep performance analysis\n- Weather bot\n- [Chicago Alerts twitter account](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- Sensor decisions for my e-ink ambient displays\n\n(_Never fear, I will document all of these later._)\n\n## Back to the office\n\nIn early 2023 my company was spiraling and I started spending a lot of time hacking on projects to clear my mind. I also started spending a lot more deliberate time in my office with the team. The limitations of the previous iteration of state based automatons started to show.\n\nArmed with this new paradigm, and a sudden influx of time, I decided to redo the notifications in the office.\n\nFirst, I prototyped the system by catching the sensor data and manually sending it to ChatGPT and seeing how it would react. It was pretty straight forward, and obviously very prompt dependent.\n\nHere is the first prompt we used\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n\n```\n\nI would pass in the default state so the Llm would know what status quo was, then I would pass in the current state, and as a wild card I passed in the last state.\n\nFor instance if this was a door:\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” } `\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nThe LLM may reply:\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\nIt saw that there isn’t a change, and told us the state. If we close the door, the llm says:\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nThis was really compelling. Kind of annoying, but compelling!\n\nNow it was time to pass a WHOLE bunch of signals to the LLM and see what happens.\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nThe main problem with this approach is that you don’t want an announcement every time a sensor changes. Since our goal was to make something better than the state based approach from 2019, we needed to group the sensors.\n\nI decided to make a really simple flask app that ultimately just collected json data from sensors over MQTT and then after a certain set of parameters (time, velocity and count) it would push bunch of the json states into one payload.\n\nThe objects look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nWhich would translate into:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFrom here it is passed to Openai to turn this json into prose:\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nThis all happens via my friend, and yours: `mqtt`.\n\nI then have a home assistant send that sends sensor changes down the wire to be collected and transformed.\n\nFast change Automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nAs you can see, both of these require that the office is “occupied” for the automation to fire. Since it costs money to generate the responses, I don’t want it to be talking about air quality when we are gone ;)\n\nI have two automations because some states are slow (air quality, physical space presence), and some are fast (personal presence, doors, AC, etc).\n\nThe automations are pretty simple: They look for state change, and then push the state change to the mqtt topic.\n\nThis works surprisingly well. Since it a home assistant automation, I can add any home assistant sensor to the agent and it will chat about it.\n\nI also have the prompt broken out separately so I can iterate on it without having to restart the entire stack. This is super helpful when you are tuning the sarcasm for your office.\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nOnce this was all built and working I decided that I wanted the office to see. As I type this, it seems like maybe it is a bad idea. However, it is hilarious.\n\nI wrote a really stupid piece of code that triggers with a motion sensor, grabs a snapshot from a security camera, and then hits a box running LLAVA and then returns json of what was on the security camera at the time of motion.\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\nThis works surprisingly well.\n\nThen I just push this json into the sensor collector and have it act like another sensor.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhich will result in:\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nThe agent can see! This added another level:\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\nQuickly followed by:\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\nAnother example where it talked about clothing:\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## All together now\n\nOnce this was all wired together we had magical experiences like this when I left the office the other day:\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nAnd now our office discord (no more slack?!) looks like this:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"The discord is popping\">}}\n\nWe are constantly iterating on the prompt and the sensors to get it to sit between annoying and funny. It is a wafer thin line.\n\nBecause the system is expecting a json payload, it is really easy to extend the agent to react to other sensors.\n\n**Hearing is next**\n\n## Codes! You can run this yourself.\n\nAll of the code is open source. It isn't pretty, and isn't mostly written by LLM. But it works well.\n\nThe code that does the sensor grabbing / LLM funny stuff here: [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)\n\nThe code for the eyeballs are here: [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\nI imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless. This code has been running without many tweaks for the last 6-8 months. It is constantly hilarious and always brings a smile to us occupants and a “wtf” from our visitor friends. If you do take a swing at it - let me know. Also, if you have any trouble, send me an [email](mailto:harper@modest.com) and maybe I can help!\n\nMy prediction is that this will be doable inside of home assistant shortly.\n\n**Part 2 will drop later. I will update yall on how we used a vtuber rig to give the agent a body**\n\n# CURRENT TRANSLATION\n**tl;dr:** _たくさんのセンサーと LLM を組み合わせて、オフィスが僕らに今起きていることをしゃべってくれるようにした。記事は長いけど仕組みはシンプル。これが僕がリアルライフで LLM を使っている実例だ。_\n\n2019 年、友人の Ivan と僕はシカゴの [最高のスタジオ](https://company.lol) で仕事を始めた。ほぼ毎日、好きなものを作りながら楽しく過ごしている。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"最高のスタジオ\">}}\n\n最初に取りかかったのは、オフィスにセンサーと自動化を追加することだった。いつでもオフィスの環境や状態を把握できるようにするのが目的だ。\n\n僕らは [Home Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) にすべてのセンサーを集約し、シンプルなオートメーションを書いて状態をアナウンスさせた。\n\n通知内容はこんな感じ：\n\n- 人が到着したときのアナウンス  \n- 温度が暑すぎる／寒すぎるとき  \n- CO₂ レベルが高すぎるとき  \n- ドアが開閉したときのチーンというチャイム音（コンビニのドア音）\n\n通知は Slack の専用チャンネルと、マイクをオフにした古い Google Home スピーカーに送っていた。このスピーカーは音が良く、天井のど真ん中、およそ 3.7 m 上に設置したので “どこからともなく聞こえる” ようになる。通知用スピーカーとしてはかなり優秀だ。\n\n通知の例：\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"機能は十分、でもかなり退屈\">}}\n\n見てのとおり役には立つけど超退屈。\n\nオフィスにいるときはもちろん、外出中でも通知はとても便利だった。COVID 初期で何もわからなかった頃、遠隔でオフィスの状態を確認できるのは安心感があった。\n\nオフィスにいると、アナウンスやさまざまな環境音的通知のおかげで未来感が漂い、オフィスが状況を理解してちょっとしたキャラがあるように感じられた。\n\nこのあと何が起こるかなんて、まったく想像できなかった……\n\n## JSON シンギュラリティの到来\n\n今や LLM 革命が世の中を大きく揺さぶり、今後数年で知的労働はワイルドで楽しく、そして複雑なものになるだろう。\n\n2020 年に GPT-3 が公開された瞬間、僕はすぐにヘンテコなソフトを作り始め、日常でどう使えるかを考えまくった。その結果 “ボット” を量産し、多くはかなりパーソナルなトーンでしゃべるようになった。\n\nお気に入りの「創発」テクニックは、構造化された `JSON` データを LLM に渡して **文章** に変換させることだ。ここで言う文章は詩ではなく、普通の文だ。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"最近のお気に入りグラフ\">}}\n\nたとえばこんな JSON を渡すと──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nこんなふうにプロンプトを添える。\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\n`GPT-4-turbo` の返事はこうだ。\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nとてもシンプルだし、JSON オブジェクトを事前に厳密に定義しておく必要もない。LLM は **ものすごく** 柔軟だ。試しに項目を一つ追加してみると──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nプロンプトを変えずに\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nと返してくれる。\n\nまるで魔法だ。\n\nあとは Python か Node で簡単にラップすれば、構造化された天気データを気にせず毎朝「今日何を着るべきか」を教えてくれるボットのできあがりだ。\n\nおもしろいことに、この手のアプリでエラーが起きても LLM は同じプロンプトでエラー内容をツイート風にしゃべってくれる。\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nこのパターンは日常的に活用している。たとえば──\n\n- 睡眠パフォーマンス解析  \n- 天気ボット  \n- [Chicago Alerts Twitter アカウント](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)  \n- E-ink アンビエントディスプレイに表示するセンサー情報の選定  \n\n(_これらは後日ちゃんと記事にする予定。_)\n\n## オフィスに話を戻そう\n\n2023 年初頭、会社が下降気味で、気分転換にプロジェクトをハックしまくるようになった。同時に、チームと過ごす時間を増やしたことで 2019 年の状態ベース自動化の限界が見えてきた。\n\n新しいパラダイムと急にできた自由時間を手に、オフィスの通知を作り直すことにした。\n\nまずはセンサーデータをキャッチして手動で ChatGPT に送り、反応を見るプロトタイプを作った。結果は当然プロンプト次第だった。\n\n最初に使ったプロンプトがこれ。\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n```\n\n`default_state` で基準値を、`current_state` で現在の状態を、さらに `last_state` を渡した。\n\nたとえばドアなら──\n\n- default_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"closed\" }`  \n- current_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`  \n- last_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`\n\nLLM の返事：\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\n変化がないと判断したわけだ。ドアを閉めると\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nかなり面白い──ちょっとウザいけど、惹きつけられる。\n\n次はもっと大量のシグナルを LLM に一気に送ってみることにした。\n\n## センサーを束ねて送信する\n\nこの方式の課題は「センサーが変わるたびにアナウンスされると騒がしすぎる」点だ。2019 年版を超えるためには、センサーの変化を束ねる必要がある。\n\nそこでとてもシンプルな Flask アプリを作り、MQTT 経由でセンサーの JSON を受け取り、一定の条件（時間、変化速度、件数）がそろったら複数の JSON を 1 つのペイロードにまとめて送るようにした。\n\nオブジェクトはこうなる。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nまとめると──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nこれを OpenAI に投げると\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nここまでをつないでくれるのは、我らが友 —— `mqtt` だ。\n\nHome Assistant のオートメーションでセンサーの状態変化を拾い、MQTT に流すようにしているので、あとから好きな Home Assistant センサーを追加すれば、すぐにエージェントがしゃべってくれる。\n\n### 高速変化オートメーション\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\n### 低速変化オートメーション\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nどちらもオフィスが `occupied` のときだけ発火する。レスポンス生成にはコストがかかるので、留守中に空気質を実況されても困るからだ。\n\nプロンプトは別ファイルにしてあるので、スタックを再起動せずにトーンを調整できるのも便利だ。\n\n## ところで「目」を付けたらどうだろう\n\n仕組みが動くようになったところで、「オフィスに視覚を持たせたい」と思った。書いていて若干不安になるけど、実際かなり面白い。\n\nモーションセンサーをトリガーに防犯カメラのスナップショットを撮り、LLAVA を動かしているサーバーに送り、結果を JSON で返す──というシンプルなコードを書いた。\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\n意外にもちゃんと動く。\n\n得られた JSON をそのまま追加センサーとして MQTT に流し込む。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone.

      "user_prompt": "# ORIGINAL TEXT\n**tl;dr:** _I use a bunch of sensors, and an LLM to make my office talk to us about what’s going on in the office. This is a long post, but should be pretty straight forward. Generally, this is a good demonstration of how I have been using LLMs in my real life._\n\nIn 2019 my buddy Ivan and I started working in this [amazing studio](https://company.lol) here in Chicago. Mostly we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\nEarly on, one of the main things I spent my time building was adding some sensors and automation to the office. My goal was to have insight into the environment, etc of the office at any time.\n\nWe used [home assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) to collect all the sensors into one platform. I built some really boring automations that would announce various states.\n\nThe notifications were pretty straight forward:\n\n- Announcing when a person arrived\n- Announcing when the temperature is too hot, too cold\n- Announcing when the CO2 level is too high\n- Making a noise when the door is open or closed (convenience store door noise)\n\nWe pushed the notifications to a slack and a an old google home speaker with the mic disabled. The speaker worked well and sounds pretty good. We placed it about 12 feet up, in the very middle of the space - so it sounds like it is coming from everywhere. If you are looking for an “notification speaker,” these are pretty solid.\n\nHere is an example of the notifications:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nAs you can see it is effective, but pretty boring.\n\nThe notifications were super helpful when we were in the office, and even more helpful when we were gone. In the beginning of Covid when nobody knew anything, it was nice to be able to monitor the state of the office remotely.\n\nWhile in the office, the announcements and various other ambient notifications made the office feel futuristic. Like the office knew what was going on and had a bit of personality.\n\nWe had no idea what was coming next...\n\n## The json-singularity is here.\n\nWe all know now that this LLM revolution is fucking everything up, and probably will make most knowledge work weird, wild, fun and complicated over the next few years.\n\nWhen GPT-3 was released in 2020, I immediately started building weird software to use it. I started thinking a lot about how to use this technology in my every day. I built lots of “bots.” Most of them had a very “personal” tone to their output.\n\nMy favorite \"emergent\" trick is to take structured `JSON` data and convert it to **prose** via the LLM. When I say prose, I don't mean poems. I mean words and sentences.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\nSpecifically I take json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nThen add a fun prompt:\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nPass it to `GPT-4-turbo` and get this:\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nPretty straight forward. What is really great, is that you don’t have to pre-define the json object. The llm is able to be **very** flexible. For instance, let’s just randomly add another entity to the json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the llm will reply with no change to the prompt:\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nThis is effectively magic. ;)\n\nNow weave it all together with a simple python or node app, and BAM - you have a bot that will tell you what to wear every morning based on structured weather data that you don’t have to be careful about.\n\nHilariously, when building this type of app - if there is an error, the LLM will interpret the error with the same prompt:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nI use this pattern constantly. I mostly build lil bots that hang out and tell me things:\n\n- Sleep performance analysis\n- Weather bot\n- [Chicago Alerts twitter account](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- Sensor decisions for my e-ink ambient displays\n\n(_Never fear, I will document all of these later._)\n\n## Back to the office\n\nIn early 2023 my company was spiraling and I started spending a lot of time hacking on projects to clear my mind. I also started spending a lot more deliberate time in my office with the team. The limitations of the previous iteration of state based automatons started to show.\n\nArmed with this new paradigm, and a sudden influx of time, I decided to redo the notifications in the office.\n\nFirst, I prototyped the system by catching the sensor data and manually sending it to ChatGPT and seeing how it would react. It was pretty straight forward, and obviously very prompt dependent.\n\nHere is the first prompt we used\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n\n```\n\nI would pass in the default state so the Llm would know what status quo was, then I would pass in the current state, and as a wild card I passed in the last state.\n\nFor instance if this was a door:\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” } `\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nThe LLM may reply:\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\nIt saw that there isn’t a change, and told us the state. If we close the door, the llm says:\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nThis was really compelling. Kind of annoying, but compelling!\n\nNow it was time to pass a WHOLE bunch of signals to the LLM and see what happens.\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nThe main problem with this approach is that you don’t want an announcement every time a sensor changes. Since our goal was to make something better than the state based approach from 2019, we needed to group the sensors.\n\nI decided to make a really simple flask app that ultimately just collected json data from sensors over MQTT and then after a certain set of parameters (time, velocity and count) it would push bunch of the json states into one payload.\n\nThe objects look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nWhich would translate into:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFrom here it is passed to Openai to turn this json into prose:\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nThis all happens via my friend, and yours: `mqtt`.\n\nI then have a home assistant send that sends sensor changes down the wire to be collected and transformed.\n\nFast change Automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nAs you can see, both of these require that the office is “occupied” for the automation to fire. Since it costs money to generate the responses, I don’t want it to be talking about air quality when we are gone ;)\n\nI have two automations because some states are slow (air quality, physical space presence), and some are fast (personal presence, doors, AC, etc).\n\nThe automations are pretty simple: They look for state change, and then push the state change to the mqtt topic.\n\nThis works surprisingly well. Since it a home assistant automation, I can add any home assistant sensor to the agent and it will chat about it.\n\nI also have the prompt broken out separately so I can iterate on it without having to restart the entire stack. This is super helpful when you are tuning the sarcasm for your office.\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nOnce this was all built and working I decided that I wanted the office to see. As I type this, it seems like maybe it is a bad idea. However, it is hilarious.\n\nI wrote a really stupid piece of code that triggers with a motion sensor, grabs a snapshot from a security camera, and then hits a box running LLAVA and then returns json of what was on the security camera at the time of motion.\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\nThis works surprisingly well.\n\nThen I just push this json into the sensor collector and have it act like another sensor.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhich will result in:\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nThe agent can see! This added another level:\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\nQuickly followed by:\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\nAnother example where it talked about clothing:\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## All together now\n\nOnce this was all wired together we had magical experiences like this when I left the office the other day:\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nAnd now our office discord (no more slack?!) looks like this:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"The discord is popping\">}}\n\nWe are constantly iterating on the prompt and the sensors to get it to sit between annoying and funny. It is a wafer thin line.\n\nBecause the system is expecting a json payload, it is really easy to extend the agent to react to other sensors.\n\n**Hearing is next**\n\n## Codes! You can run this yourself.\n\nAll of the code is open source. It isn't pretty, and isn't mostly written by LLM. But it works well.\n\nThe code that does the sensor grabbing / LLM funny stuff here: [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)\n\nThe code for the eyeballs are here: [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\nI imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless. This code has been running without many tweaks for the last 6-8 months. It is constantly hilarious and always brings a smile to us occupants and a “wtf” from our visitor friends. If you do take a swing at it - let me know. Also, if you have any trouble, send me an [email](mailto:harper@modest.com) and maybe I can help!\n\nMy prediction is that this will be doable inside of home assistant shortly.\n\n**Part 2 will drop later. I will update yall on how we used a vtuber rig to give the agent a body**\n\n# CURRENT TRANSLATION\n**tl;dr:** _たくさんのセンサーと LLM を組み合わせて、オフィスが僕らに今起きていることをしゃべってくれるようにした。記事は長いけど仕組みはシンプル。これが僕がリアルライフで LLM を使っている実例だ。_\n\n2019 年、友人の Ivan と僕はシカゴの [最高のスタジオ](https://company.lol) で仕事を始めた。ほぼ毎日、好きなものを作りながら楽しく過ごしている。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"最高のスタジオ\">}}\n\n最初に取りかかったのは、オフィスにセンサーと自動化を追加することだった。いつでもオフィスの環境や状態を把握できるようにするのが目的だ。\n\n僕らは [Home Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) にすべてのセンサーを集約し、シンプルなオートメーションを書いて状態をアナウンスさせた。\n\n通知内容はこんな感じ：\n\n- 人が到着したときのアナウンス  \n- 温度が暑すぎる／寒すぎるとき  \n- CO₂ レベルが高すぎるとき  \n- ドアが開閉したときのチーンというチャイム音（コンビニのドア音）\n\n通知は Slack の専用チャンネルと、マイクをオフにした古い Google Home スピーカーに送っていた。このスピーカーは音が良く、天井のど真ん中、およそ 3.7 m 上に設置したので “どこからともなく聞こえる” ようになる。通知用スピーカーとしてはかなり優秀だ。\n\n通知の例：\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"機能は十分、でもかなり退屈\">}}\n\n見てのとおり役には立つけど超退屈。\n\nオフィスにいるときはもちろん、外出中でも通知はとても便利だった。COVID 初期で何もわからなかった頃、遠隔でオフィスの状態を確認できるのは安心感があった。\n\nオフィスにいると、アナウンスやさまざまな環境音的通知のおかげで未来感が漂い、オフィスが状況を理解してちょっとしたキャラがあるように感じられた。\n\nこのあと何が起こるかなんて、まったく想像できなかった……\n\n## JSON シンギュラリティの到来\n\n今や LLM 革命が世の中を大きく揺さぶり、今後数年で知的労働はワイルドで楽しく、そして複雑なものになるだろう。\n\n2020 年に GPT-3 が公開された瞬間、僕はすぐにヘンテコなソフトを作り始め、日常でどう使えるかを考えまくった。その結果 “ボット” を量産し、多くはかなりパーソナルなトーンでしゃべるようになった。\n\nお気に入りの「創発」テクニックは、構造化された `JSON` データを LLM に渡して **文章** に変換させることだ。ここで言う文章は詩ではなく、普通の文だ。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"最近のお気に入りグラフ\">}}\n\nたとえばこんな JSON を渡すと──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nこんなふうにプロンプトを添える。\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\n`GPT-4-turbo` の返事はこうだ。\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nとてもシンプルだし、JSON オブジェクトを事前に厳密に定義しておく必要もない。LLM は **ものすごく** 柔軟だ。試しに項目を一つ追加してみると──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nプロンプトを変えずに\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nと返してくれる。\n\nまるで魔法だ。\n\nあとは Python か Node で簡単にラップすれば、構造化された天気データを気にせず毎朝「今日何を着るべきか」を教えてくれるボットのできあがりだ。\n\nおもしろいことに、この手のアプリでエラーが起きても LLM は同じプロンプトでエラー内容をツイート風にしゃべってくれる。\n\n> Facing a 401 server error?

Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n```\n\n`default_state` で基準値を、`current_state` で現在の状態を、さらに `last_state` を渡した。\n\nたとえばドアなら──\n\n- default_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"closed\" }`  \n- current_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`  \n- last_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`\n\nLLM の返事：\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\n変化がないと判断したわけだ。ドアを閉めると\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nかなり面白い──ちょっとウザいけど、惹きつけられる。\n\n次はもっと大量のシグナルを LLM に一気に送ってみることにした。\n\n## センサーを束ねて送信する\n\nこの方式の課題は「センサーが変わるたびにアナウンスされると騒がしすぎる」点だ。2019 年版を超えるためには、センサーの変化を束ねる必要がある。\n\nそこでとてもシンプルな Flask アプリを作り、MQTT 経由でセンサーの JSON を受け取り、一定の条件（時間、変化速度、件数）がそろったら複数の JSON を 1 つのペイロードにまとめて送るようにした。\n\nオブジェクトはこうなる。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nまとめると──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nこれを OpenAI に投げると\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nここまでをつないでくれるのは、我らが友 —— `mqtt` だ。\n\nHome Assistant のオートメーションでセンサーの状態変化を拾い、MQTT に流すようにしているので、あとから好きな Home Assistant センサーを追加すれば、すぐにエージェントがしゃべってくれる。\n\n### 高速変化オートメーション\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\n### 低速変化オートメーション\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nどちらもオフィスが `occupied` のときだけ発火する。レスポンス生成にはコストがかかるので、留守中に空気質を実況されても困るからだ。\n\nプロンプトは別ファイルにしてあるので、スタックを再起動せずにトーンを調整できるのも便利だ。\n\n## ところで「目」を付けたらどうだろう\n\n仕組みが動くようになったところで、「オフィスに視覚を持たせたい」と思った。書いていて若干不安になるけど、実際かなり面白い。\n\nモーションセンサーをトリガーに防犯カメラのスナップショットを撮り、LLAVA を動かしているサーバーに送り、結果を JSON で返す──というシンプルなコードを書いた。\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\n意外にもちゃんと動く。\n\n得られた JSON をそのまま追加センサーとして MQTT に流し込む。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nすると──\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nエージェントが「見る」ようになった！ さらに──\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\nさらに続けて──\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\n服装へのコメントも──\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## すべてを合体させてみた\n\n全部をつなげると、たとえば僕がこの前オフィスを出たときにはこんな実況が流れた。\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nそして今やオフィスの Discord はこんな感じだ。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"Discord は盛り上がり中\">}}\n\n「ウザい」と「面白い」の紙一重を狙って、プロンプトとセンサーを日々チューニングしている。\n\nシステムは JSON ペイロードを受け取るだけなので、センサーを追加するのもとても簡単だ。\n\n**次は“聴覚”を持たせる予定**\n\n## コード公開 — 自分でも動かせるよ\n\nコードはすべてオープンソース。見た目はあまりきれいじゃないし、ほとんどは LLM が書いたわけでもないけれど、ちゃんと動く。\n\n- センサー取得と LLM 変換のコード: [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)  \n- カメラ用 “eyeballs” のコード: [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\n大きなトラブルもなく 6〜8 か月動き続けていて、僕ら居住メンバーには笑顔を、訪問者には「wtf?」をもたらしてくれる。もし試してみたらぜひ教えてほしい。つまずいたら [メール](mailto:harper@modest.com) を送ってもらえれば、手助けできるかもしれない。\n\nそのうち Home Assistant だけで完結できるようになると予想している。\n\n**Part 2 は後日公開予定。VTuber リグでエージェントに “身体” を与えた話をお楽しみに！**\n\n# CRITIQUE FEEDBACK\n【総評】\n訳文は大筋で内容を押さえているものの、①原文の毒や下品さを含むカジュアルで破天荒な語り口が大幅に薄まり、②いくつかの情報・ニュアンスが欠落／改変され、③細部の文法・表現に機械翻訳的／日本語として不自然な箇所が散見される。  \n技術用語の訳語はおおむね安定しているが、スタイル面で「原文通りに“荒っぽくてふざけた一人称ブログ”を日本語に再現する」という要求を満たしていない。\n\n以下、重大度別に問題点と改善案を列挙する。\n\n────────────────────\n■Critical（致命的／必修レベル）\n1. 省略・追加による意味の欠落／逸脱  \n   1-1. “This is super helpful when you are tuning the sarcasm for your office.”  \n        →「スタックを再起動せずにトーンを調整できるのも便利だ。」と訳して“sarcasm”が消滅。  \n        修正案: 「…便利だ。特にオフィス向けに“皮肉度”を微調整するときに超役立つ。」など。  \n\n   1-2. “I imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless.”  \n        →丸ごと落ちている。  \n        修正案: 「配線はそこまで難しくないと思うけど、かといって完全にシームレスでもない。」を追加。  \n\n   1-3. “(no more slack?!)” の省略  \n        原文のツッコミが消えて Discord 移行のニュアンス低減。  \n        修正案: 「（もう Slack じゃないってこと?!）」など括弧付き挿入。  \n\n   1-4. 原文にない文言の挿入  \n        「ここまでをつないでくれるのは、我らが友 —— mqtt だ。」という言い回しは原文の “…via my friend, and yours: `mqtt`.” を過剰意訳し、散文のリズムを改変している（友達呼ばわり＋ダッシュ演出は追加要素）。  \n        修正案: 「ここでも相棒は `mqtt`。」など簡潔に。\n\n2. トーン／レジスターのズレ（原文の強い下品さと親しみが失われている）  \n   - “fuck off”, “fucking everything up”, “shit” 系の語感が“楽しく過ごしている”“大きく揺さぶり”などに軟化。  \n   - 原文の荒っぽい自己卑下・皮肉（wafer-thin line, seriously, WTF など）の温度が数段下がる。  \n   改善方針:  \n     • 罵り語は日本語でもライトなスラング（「クソ」「クッソ」「ぶっ壊す」「マジで」等）を適度に入れる。  \n     • 文末や接続詞を砕けた口語に寄せる（「〜なんだわ」「〜だぜ」等）。  \n     • 顔文字や絵文字の残存は OK、ですが英語原文と同じ位置で使うこと。  \n\n────────────────────\n■Major（重要／放置すると品質に影響）\n1. ニュアンスの取りこぼし・弱体化  \n   - “tl;dr: … This is a long post, but should be pretty straight forward.”  \n     「記事は長いけど仕組みはシンプル」だけだと “pretty straight forward (けっこう分かりやすい)” を訳していない。  \n     →「長いけど分かりやすいはず」など追記。  \n   - “BAM” や “Hilariously” など感嘆語のカット。  \n   - “we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.”  \n     →「ほぼ毎日、好きなものを作りながら楽しく過ごしている」で“fuck off”のグダグダ感が消失。  \n       改訳: 「基本ダラダラ遊びながら、面白いモノを作りまくってる。」  \n\n2. 一貫性／書式  \n   - コードブロック内コメントの一部が全角日本語なのにコードは英語、視認性が下がる。  \n     →コメントは原文ママか、日本語にするなら両方揃える。  \n   - “Home Assistant”→「Home Assistant」と大文字小文字は守れているが、“home assistant automation” を「Home Assistant のオートメーション」と訳したり「home assistant センサー」と小文字になったり揺れている。  \n     →表記統一。  \n\n3. 機械翻訳風・英語語順残存  \n   例: 「センサーの JSON を受け取り、一定の条件（時間、変化速度、件数）がそろったら複数の JSON を 1 つのペイロードにまとめて送るようにした。」  \n        長すぎ・重複 (JSON ×2)。  \n        改訳: 「MQTT で受け取ったセンサーの JSON を、時間・変化量・件数の条件がそろった時点でまとめて１つのペイロードにして送る。」  \n\n────────────────────\n■Moderate（中程度／改善推奨）\n1. 日本語としての不自然・冗長表現  \n   - 「オフィスに視覚を持たせたいと“思った”。書いていて若干“不安になる”けど」→「…思い立った。こう書くと若干ヤバい気もするけど」等、語感のブレ修正。  \n   - ダッシュ「──」「——」や三点リーダ「…」の多用で読点が散漫。原文のリズムを尊重しつつ統一を。  \n\n2. 語彙レベル  \n   - “magic” を「まるで魔法だ」→堅い。「マジで魔法」や「ほんとチート」などラフに。  \n   - “wafer-thin line” を「紙一重」まではOKだが “wafer-thin” の食感が活かせると面白い。（例： ‘クレープ並みに薄いライン’ など遊び）  \n\n3. 画像キャプション  \n   原文 “Boring and not very smart” を「機能は十分、でもかなり退屈」→“not very smart” が消失。  \n   改: 「役立つけど賢くはない、そして退屈」など。  \n\n────────────────────\n■Minor（軽微／任意）\n1. 体裁  \n   - コロン後に全角スペースだったり半角だったり。  \n   - 数字の全角／半角混在（6〜8 か月／32°F など）。  \n2. “Home Assistant” の Wiki リンクは日本 Wiki があるので差し替え可。  \n3. “エージェントが『見る』ようになった！” の後の “さらに──” は一拍置くだけで良い。  \n\n────────────────────\n【まとめ／優先修正手順】\n1. 省略された文（sarcasm 調整、wiring の難易度、no-more-slack 等）を復元。  \n2. 原文の下品さ・乱雑さを日本語スラングで再現し、全体のトーンを引き上げる。  \n3. ニュアンス弱体箇所（fuck off, fucking everything up, BAM, Hilariously など）を口語・感嘆語で補完。  \n4. 不要な追加意訳（我らが友 —— mqtt 等）を削ぎ落とし、語順・重複を整理して読みやすい自然な日本語へ。  \n5. 技術用語と書式の統一（Home Assistant, JSON, MQTT など）。  \n\n以上を徹底すれば、「英語のラフなブログをそのまま日本語の口語に焼き直した」かのような、より原文忠実で生き生きした訳文になる。\n\nPlease address ALL issues identified in the critique and provide an improved translation.\nReturn ONLY the improved translated text without explanations or comments.",

Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n```\n\n`default_state` がデフォ、`current_state` が現在、`last_state` が直前の状態。\n\nたとえばドアの場合:\n\n- default_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"closed\" }`  \n- current_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`  \n- last_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`\n\nLLM の返事:\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\n変化なし、と判断。ドアを閉めると――\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\n面白いけど、ちょいウザい。でもクセになる！\n\n次はもっと大量のシグナルを一気に LLM にぶち込んでみた。\n\n## センサーをまとめてブチ込む\n\n問題は、センサーが変わるたびにアナウンスされたら騒がしすぎること。2019 年版よりマシにするために、センサーの変化を束ねる仕組みが必要だ。\n\nそこで超シンプルな Flask アプリを作成。MQTT 経由でセンサーの JSON を受け取り、時間・変化量・件数などの条件がそろったらまとめて 1 つのペイロードにして送る。\n\nオブジェクト例:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\n束ねると:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nこれを OpenAI に投げると――\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nここでも相棒は `mqtt`。\n\nHome Assistant のオートメーションがセンサー変化を拾って MQTT に流すので、新しい Home Assistant センサーを追加すれば即しゃべり出す。\n\n### 高速変化オートメーション (5 秒)\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\n### 低速変化オートメーション (5 分)\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nどちらもオフィスが `occupied` のときだけ発火。応答生成は課金だから、留守中に空気質を実況されてもムダ金だしね。\n\nプロンプトは別ファイルに分けてあるので、スタックを再起動せずにトーン――とくに“皮肉度”――をチューニングできる。これがマジ便利。\n\n## んで、“目” を付けたらどうよ？\n\n仕組みが安定したところで、「オフィスに視覚持たせたら爆笑じゃね？」と思い立った。こう書くと若干ヤバい気もするけど、実際おもろい。\n\nモーションセンサーをトリガーに防犯カメラのスナップショットを撮り、LLAVA を走らせて JSON で返す――そんなクソ単純なコードを書いた。\n\n```python\n# (コードは割愛)\n```\n\n意外とちゃんと動く。\n\n返ってきた JSON をそのまま追加センサーとして MQTT に流し込む。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone.

Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## ぜんぶ合体するとこうなる\n\nこの前オフィスを出たときの実況がコレ:\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nそして今やオフィス Discord（もう Slack じゃないってこと?!）はこんな感じ:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"Discord がバチバチに盛り上がり中\">}}\n\n「ウザい」と「笑える」のクレープ並みに薄いラインを狙って、プロンプトとセンサーを日々チューニングしてる。\n\nシステムは JSON ペイロードを待ってるだけだから、センサーを増やすのも超ラク。\n\n**次は“聴覚”を付ける予定だぜ**\n\n## コード公開 — 自分でも動かせるぞ\n\nコードは全部 OSS。見た目はキレイじゃないし、ほぼ LLM も書いてないけど、ちゃんと動く。\n\n- センサー取得＆LLM 変換: [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)  \n- “目玉” カメラ側コード: [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\n配線はそこまで難しくないと思うけど、かといって完全シームレスでもない。とはいえ 6〜8 か月ほぼノーメンテで動いてて、居住メンバーには笑顔を、来客には「WTF?」を提供中。試したらぜひ教えてくれ。ハマったら [メール](mailto:harper@modest.com) くれたら、たぶん助ける！\n\nそのうち全部 Home Assistant だけで完結するようになると予想。\n\n**Part 2 は後日！ VTuber リグでエージェントに“身体”を与えた話をお楽しみに！**",

YAML 内コメント  \n　インデントを原文どおり維持しないと技術記事読者がコピペ検証しにくい。コードブロック部分は極力原状維持推奨。\n\n────────────────────\n◆Stylistic choices（好みだが検討余地）\n────────────────────\n・「実質マジックです。」は軽妙で悪くないが「ガチで魔法みたいです。」など YouTuber 口調も検討可。  \n・「センサーを 1 つのプラットフォームに集約」よりも「ぶち込む」「まとめて突っ込む」などカジュアル化しても良い。  \n・「副次的」→「隠し芸」「裏ワザ」など親しみやすい訳語提案。\n\n────────────────────\n◆まとめ\n致命的な誤訳は 1 箇所（LLM が書いた部分の逆転）ですが、欠落が数点あり、原文の荒っぽさ／ユーモアを削ぎ落したせいで筆者のキャラクターが薄まっています。  \n上記 Critical と Major を優先的に修正し、トーンを少しだけラフに調整、用語を統一すれば「原文を日本語でそのまま読んでいるような」訳文に仕上がるはずです。",
      "【総合評価】  \n全体としては原文のノリ・勢いをかなり上手く再現できており、情報量もほぼ欠落していません。しかし「ほぼ完璧」に仕上げるには、以下の点を修正する必要があります。特に①意味の取り違え／欠落と②日本語としての不自然さ（語調・罵語・英語混じり表現の過多）が目立ちます。\n\n──────────────────────────  \n1. 重大（Critical）: 意味の誤訳・抜け・事実誤認  \n──────────────────────────  \n1-A. 原文の一文が丸ごと欠落  \n　• “I imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless.”  \n　　→ 訳文では触れられておらず、「配線はさほど難しくないが完全自動ではない」というニュアンスが抜け落ちている。  \n　【改善案】「配線自体はそこまで難しくないと思うけど、決してシームレスではない。」などを追記。\n\n1-B. “Since it a home assistant automation, I can add any home assistant sensor to the agent and it will chat about it.”  \n　• 訳文は「Home Assistantでは、センサーの状態変化を拾ってMQTTへ流すオートメーションを設定している。」だけで終わり、  \n　　「好きな Home Assistant センサーをあとから追加できる」という拡張性の説明が抜けている。  \n　【改善案】末尾に「だから後から好きな Home Assistant センサーを追加すれば、すぐにエージェントがしゃべってくれる。」等を補う。\n\n1-C. profanity の強度差  \n　• “We just fuck off …” や “LLM revolution is fucking everything up” の強烈さが「好き勝手に（クソみたいに）」程度に弱まっている。  \n　　意図的に緩めたなら良いが、原文どおりの破壊力を再現したいなら語気を上げる必要がある。  \n　【改善案】「好き放題やり散らかして」「LLM 革命が世の中をめちゃくちゃにしてる」などでトーンを合わせる。\n\n1-D. 技術用語の正確性  \n　• “Home Assistant” を小文字 “home assistant” と表記ゆれさせる箇所がある。  \n　• “Flask” → 「flask アプリ」と小文字にしている例もあり統一されていない。  \n　【改善案】固有名詞は原文どおり “Home Assistant”“Flask” で統一。\n\n──────────────────────────  \n2. 重要（Major）: ニュアンス喪失・語調／登録不整合  \n──────────────────────────  \n2-A. 罵語・俗語の選択  \n　• “ぶちこんで”“ガンガン仕込む”“クソみたいに” などは砕けすぎ・品がない上、原文の “fuck off” “LLM is fucking everything up” とは用法が若干ズレる。  \n　【改善案】“ぶちこんで”→“突っ込んで” / “クソみたいに遊びながら”→“好き勝手に遊び倒しながら” など、荒さを残しつつ日本語として自然な口語に。\n\n2-B. 不自然なカタカナ直訳見出し  \n　• “Sensors bunches（センサーを山盛りで投げる）” は意味が取りづらい。“センサーのまとめ送信” 等に修正。  \n　• “All together now” もそのまま残しているが、日本語見出しに置き換えた方が滑らか。\n\n2-C. 別の英語を混ぜ込みすぎ  \n　• “Fast change automation / Slow change automation” の見出しや “MQTT だ。” など、読点直後に突然英語が出てくる箇所が多い。  \n　【改善案】見出しは「高速変化オートメーション」「低速変化オートメーション」にするなど、統一感を出す。\n\n2-D. Unit / 数値表現  \n　• “約3.7 m” と半角スペース入り。通常は「約3.7メートル」。  \n　• 32°F は日本の読者には摂氏換算を補う方が親切（「約0℃」など）。\n\n──────────────────────────  \n3. 中程度（Minor）: 文法・表記・スタイル  \n──────────────────────────  \n3-A. 一文が長すぎ／読点不足  \n　• 例:「MQTT経由でセンサーのJSONを集め、一定の条件（時間、変化速度、件数）がそろったらまとめて1ペイロードにして送る、超シンプルなFlaskアプリを作った。」  \n　【改善案】一文を二つに割り、読点を減らして読みやすくする。\n\n3-B. カギ括弧・ダッシュのゆれ  \n　• “—” と “―” の混在。統一推奨。  \n　• 「“通知用スピーカー”」は「通知用スピーカー」と全角二重カギにするか半角引用符か、決めて統一。\n\n3-C. 顔文字・絵文字の扱い  \n　• 原文の 😉 を「😉」と訳しているが、日本語文中で直後にピリオドを置かないため文末がやや間延びする。  \n　【改善案】「😉。」や「😉だ。」など句点を補う。\n\n3-D. 誤字・タイプミス  \n　• “an「notification speaker」” → 原文の “a” を訳文で言及する必要はないが、元の誤記まで写経していないか確認。  \n　• “discord” → 固有サービスなので “Discord” が正。訳文では前半大文字・後半は小文字で統一感がない。\n\n──────────────────────────  \n4. 文体・トーン整合性  \n──────────────────────────  \n4-A. 一人称のぶれ  \n　• 「僕」「俺」などは出ていないものの、口調が場所によって丁寧語に寄ったり崩れたりする。  \n　【改善案】全体をラフな男性口語で統一するなら「だ・である調」ではなく「〜だよ」「〜だぜ」などで統一。\n\n4-B. ハンター・S・トンプソン引用  \n　• Prompt 部分で “Be a bit like Hunter S Thompson.” が “Hunter S. Thompson” の “.” が落ちている。微細だが固有名詞表記は正確に。\n\n──────────────────────────  \n5. 機械翻訳臭・不自然な直訳  \n──────────────────────────  \n5-A. “ここからさらにレベルアップ：”  \n　→ “〜：” とコロン終止は直訳感が強い。「さらにもう一段階上へ。」など流暢に。  \n5-B. “めちゃくちゃ退屈なオートメーション”  \n　→ “boring” は「つまらない」「退屈な」だが、ここは「味気ない」など自然語彙が望ましい。\n\n──────────────────────────  \n【修正優先順位】  \n1. 欠落の補填（1-A, 1-B）  \n2. 固有名詞・技術語の統一（1-D）  \n3. 罵語・語調の調整（1-C, 2-A）  \n4. 英語・カタカナ混在見出しの日本語化（2-B, 2-C）  \n5. 文体・表記ゆれの微調整（3, 4, 5）\n\n上記を反映すれば「原文どおりに尖っていて読むのが楽しい、かつ日本語として破綻のない」訳文になります。",
      "Translation Critique – organised by severity and category\n\n────────────\nA. CRITICAL (Fidelity / Meaning)\n────────────\n1. Added information inside quoted LLM output  \n   • JP: 「Brrr, it's 32°F (約0℃)…」  \n   • EN original has no “(約0℃)”.  \n   → Never alter a quoted sample; either keep it verbatim in English or translate the whole tweet. Delete the parenthetical or provide a full JP rendition (“0°F＝およそ0 ℃” etc.) outside the quote.\n\n2. Semantic shift: “変態ソフト” for “weird software”  \n   • “変態” brings a sexual/perverted nuance absent from “weird”.  \n   → Use “変わったソフト” “イカれたソフト” “ヘンテコなソフト” to preserve the casual tone without unwanted implications.\n\n3. Missing receiver “us” in first sentence  \n   • EN: “…make my office talk to us…”  \n   • JP: “…オフィスが…しゃべってくれるようにした。”  \n   → Add 聞き手: “オフィスが僕らに向かって…” for accuracy.\n\n4. Omitted nuance of “a Slack”  \n   • EN: “pushed … to a Slack and an old Google Home speaker” (author treats Slack workspace as one of many).  \n   • JP renders simply “Slack”, losing the idea of “専用Slackチャンネル”.  \n   → Consider “Slack の特定チャンネル” or similar.\n\n────────────\nB. MAJOR (Style / Tone / Consistency)\n────────────\n5. Caption localisation inconsistent  \n   • “Our amazing studio”, “Boring and not very smart”, “my new favorite graph” left in English while body is JP.  \n   → Either translate captions or mark them as intentionally untranslated. Consistency is key.\n\n6. JP tone occasionally overshoots original profanity  \n   • e.g. “ガンガン追加”, “クソ単純”, “笑えるからOK”, “面白いものを作り散らかしている”.  \n   • Original uses “fuck off” once, but overall profanity is mild.  \n   → Dial back or match frequency. Keep casual, not gratuitously coarse.\n\n7. Inconsistent rendering of proper nouns  \n   • “Home Assistant” sometimes in full-width brackets, sometimes plain.  \n   • “Discord” once as “Discord” once as “discord”.  \n   → Standardise capitalisation and bracket style.\n\n8. Technical term “velocity” rendered “変化速度” only once  \n   • Later reference “速度” disappears → may confuse.  \n   → Keep the same JP term (“変化速度”) throughout.\n\n────────────\nC. MODERATE (Grammar / Naturalness)\n────────────\n9. Slightly awkward verb choice  \n   • “見てのとおり効くけど超退屈” – 「効く」 doesn’t collocate with 通知.  \n   → “役には立つけど” or “機能的だけど”.\n\n10. Dangling sentence ending with 「漂い」  \n    • 「未来感が漂い、…感じられた。」 is smoother.\n\n11. “E-ink アンビエントディスプレイ用のセンサー判断” is opaque.  \n    → “E-ink アンビエントディスプレイで表示するセンサー情報の選定” etc.\n\n12. Colon misuse 「：」 in JP prose  \n    → Replace with “—” or Japanese full-width colon “：” only inside lists.\n\n────────────\nD. MINOR (Omissions / Extras / Machine-like)\n────────────\n13. Added wink emoji 😉 in non-quoted prose; original only in quoted line.  \n    → Remove or mirror original placement.\n\n14. “皮肉度合い” (sarcasm level) – “sarcasm” not mentioned in original.  \n    → Rephrase to neutral “トーン” or omit.\n\n15. Slight mistranslation of “velocity” as “変化速度” could be “発生頻度” given context (grouping logic). Check against code.\n\n16. “未来感が漂い、『オフィスが状況を把握して人格まである』みたいに…” – The original “…and had a bit of personality.” not “人格まである”.  \n    → “ちょっとしたキャラがあるように感じられた”.\n\n17. “望むなら” missing before “send me an email” – minor but can clarify.\n\n────────────\nE. FORMATTING / CODE\n────────────\n18. Back-tick blocks: Ensure JP explanatory comments are outside the fenced code so they don’t break copy-paste.\n\n19. Mixed half/full-width punctuation in YAML sections – keep as original to avoid syntax errors.\n\n────────────\nSuggested Global Fixes\n────────────\n• Review all quoted examples: leave verbatim English or supply full JP version, but never hybrid.  \n• Harmonise register: casual, first-person male, mild profanity exactly where source has it.  \n• Standardise terminology: Home Assistant, MQTT, Flask, “センサー”, “エージェント”, etc.  \n• Double-check every sentence for subtle meaning drift (e.g., “人格まである”).  \n• After corrections, read aloud to ensure it flows like native JP blog post.\n\nImplementing these changes will restore 100 % fidelity while keeping the lively, conversational flavour the author intended.",
      "【総評】\n訳文は大筋で内容を押さえているものの、①原文の毒や下品さを含むカジュアルで破天荒な語り口が大幅に薄まり、②いくつかの情報・ニュアンスが欠落／改変され、③細部の文法・表現に機械翻訳的／日本語として不自然な箇所が散見される。  \n技術用語の訳語はおおむね安定しているが、スタイル面で「原文通りに“荒っぽくてふざけた一人称ブログ”を日本語に再現する」という要求を満たしていない。\n\n以下、重大度別に問題点と改善案を列挙する。\n\n────────────────────\n■Critical（致命的／必修レベル）\n1. 省略・追加による意味の欠落／逸脱  \n   1-1. “This is super helpful when you are tuning the sarcasm for your office.”  \n        →「スタックを再起動せずにトーンを調整できるのも便利だ。」と訳して“sarcasm”が消滅。  \n        修正案: 「…便利だ。特にオフィス向けに“皮肉度”を微調整するときに超役立つ。」など。  \n\n   1-2. “I imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless.”  \n        →丸ごと落ちている。  \n        修正案: 「配線はそこまで難しくないと思うけど、かといって完全にシームレスでもない。」を追加。  \n\n   1-3. “(no more slack?!)” の省略  \n        原文のツッコミが消えて Discord 移行のニュアンス低減。  \n        修正案: 「（もう Slack じゃないってこと?!）」など括弧付き挿入。  \n\n   1-4. 原文にない文言の挿入  \n        「ここまでをつないでくれるのは、我らが友 —— mqtt だ。」という言い回しは原文の “…via my friend, and yours: `mqtt`.” を過剰意訳し、散文のリズムを改変している（友達呼ばわり＋ダッシュ演出は追加要素）。  \n        修正案: 「ここでも相棒は `mqtt`。」など簡潔に。\n\n2. トーン／レジスターのズレ（原文の強い下品さと親しみが失われている）  \n   - “fuck off”, “fucking everything up”, “shit” 系の語感が“楽しく過ごしている”“大きく揺さぶり”などに軟化。  \n   - 原文の荒っぽい自己卑下・皮肉（wafer-thin line, seriously, WTF など）の温度が数段下がる。  \n   改善方針:  \n     • 罵り語は日本語でもライトなスラング（「クソ」「クッソ」「ぶっ壊す」「マジで」等）を適度に入れる。  \n     • 文末や接続詞を砕けた口語に寄せる（「〜なんだわ」「〜だぜ」等）。  \n     • 顔文字や絵文字の残存は OK、ですが英語原文と同じ位置で使うこと。  \n\n────────────────────\n■Major（重要／放置すると品質に影響）\n1. ニュアンスの取りこぼし・弱体化  \n   - “tl;dr: … This is a long post, but should be pretty straight forward.”  \n     「記事は長いけど仕組みはシンプル」だけだと “pretty straight forward (けっこう分かりやすい)” を訳していない。  \n     →「長いけど分かりやすいはず」など追記。  \n   - “BAM” や “Hilariously” など感嘆語のカット。  \n   - “we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.”  \n     →「ほぼ毎日、好きなものを作りながら楽しく過ごしている」で“fuck off”のグダグダ感が消失。  \n       改訳: 「基本ダラダラ遊びながら、面白いモノを作りまくってる。」  \n\n2. 一貫性／書式  \n   - コードブロック内コメントの一部が全角日本語なのにコードは英語、視認性が下がる。  \n     →コメントは原文ママか、日本語にするなら両方揃える。  \n   - “Home Assistant”→「Home Assistant」と大文字小文字は守れているが、“home assistant automation” を「Home Assistant のオートメーション」と訳したり「home assistant センサー」と小文字になったり揺れている。  \n     →表記統一。  \n\n3. 機械翻訳風・英語語順残存  \n   例: 「センサーの JSON を受け取り、一定の条件（時間、変化速度、件数）がそろったら複数の JSON を 1 つのペイロードにまとめて送るようにした。」  \n        長すぎ・重複 (JSON ×2)。  \n        改訳: 「MQTT で受け取ったセンサーの JSON を、時間・変化量・件数の条件がそろった時点でまとめて１つのペイロードにして送る。」  \n\n────────────────────\n■Moderate（中程度／改善推奨）\n1. 日本語としての不自然・冗長表現  \n   - 「オフィスに視覚を持たせたいと“思った”。書いていて若干“不安になる”けど」→「…思い立った。こう書くと若干ヤバい気もするけど」等、語感のブレ修正。  \n   - ダッシュ「──」「——」や三点リーダ「…」の多用で読点が散漫。原文のリズムを尊重しつつ統一を。  \n\n2. 語彙レベル  \n   - “magic” を「まるで魔法だ」→堅い。「マジで魔法」や「ほんとチート」などラフに。  \n   - “wafer-thin line” を「紙一重」まではOKだが “wafer-thin” の食感が活かせると面白い。（例： ‘クレープ並みに薄いライン’ など遊び）  \n\n3. 画像キャプション  \n   原文 “Boring and not very smart” を「機能は十分、でもかなり退屈」→“not very smart” が消失。  \n   改: 「役立つけど賢くはない、そして退屈」など。  \n\n────────────────────\n■Minor（軽微／任意）\n1. 体裁  \n   - コロン後に全角スペースだったり半角だったり。  \n   - 数字の全角／半角混在（6〜8 か月／32°F など）。  \n2. “Home Assistant” の Wiki リンクは日本 Wiki があるので差し替え可。  \n3. “エージェントが『見る』ようになった！” の後の “さらに──” は一拍置くだけで良い。  \n\n────────────────────\n【まとめ／優先修正手順】\n1. 省略された文（sarcasm 調整、wiring の難易度、no-more-slack 等）を復元。  \n2. 原文の下品さ・乱雑さを日本語スラングで再現し、全体のトーンを引き上げる。  \n3. ニュアンス弱体箇所（fuck off, fucking everything up, BAM, Hilariously など）を口語・感嘆語で補完。  \n4. 不要な追加意訳（我らが友 —— mqtt 等）を削ぎ落とし、語順・重複を整理して読みやすい自然な日本語へ。  \n5. 技術用語と書式の統一（Home Assistant, JSON, MQTT など）。  \n\n以上を徹底すれば、「英語のラフなブログをそのまま日本語の口語に焼き直した」かのような、より原文忠実で生き生きした訳文になる。"
