      "user_prompt": "# CONTEXT\nThis is a blog post about my office hacks\n\n# TEXT TO TRANSLATE\n**tl;dr:** _I use a bunch of sensors, and an LLM to make my office talk to us about what’s going on in the office. This is a long post, but should be pretty straight forward. Generally, this is a good demonstration of how I have been using LLMs in my real life._\n\nIn 2019 my buddy Ivan and I started working in this [amazing studio](https://company.lol) here in Chicago. Mostly we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\nEarly on, one of the main things I spent my time building was adding some sensors and automation to the office. My goal was to have insight into the environment, etc of the office at any time.\n\nWe used [home assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) to collect all the sensors into one platform. I built some really boring automations that would announce various states.\n\nThe notifications were pretty straight forward:\n\n- Announcing when a person arrived\n- Announcing when the temperature is too hot, too cold\n- Announcing when the CO2 level is too high\n- Making a noise when the door is open or closed (convenience store door noise)\n\nWe pushed the notifications to a slack and a an old google home speaker with the mic disabled. The speaker worked well and sounds pretty good. We placed it about 12 feet up, in the very middle of the space - so it sounds like it is coming from everywhere. If you are looking for an “notification speaker,” these are pretty solid.\n\nHere is an example of the notifications:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nAs you can see it is effective, but pretty boring.\n\nThe notifications were super helpful when we were in the office, and even more helpful when we were gone. In the beginning of Covid when nobody knew anything, it was nice to be able to monitor the state of the office remotely.\n\nWhile in the office, the announcements and various other ambient notifications made the office feel futuristic. Like the office knew what was going on and had a bit of personality.\n\nWe had no idea what was coming next...\n\n## The json-singularity is here.\n\nWe all know now that this LLM revolution is fucking everything up, and probably will make most knowledge work weird, wild, fun and complicated over the next few years.\n\nWhen GPT-3 was released in 2020, I immediately started building weird software to use it. I started thinking a lot about how to use this technology in my every day. I built lots of “bots.” Most of them had a very “personal” tone to their output.\n\nMy favorite \"emergent\" trick is to take structured `JSON` data and convert it to **prose** via the LLM. When I say prose, I don't mean poems. I mean words and sentences.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\nSpecifically I take json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nThen add a fun prompt:\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nPass it to `GPT-4-turbo` and get this:\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nPretty straight forward. What is really great, is that you don’t have to pre-define the json object. The llm is able to be **very** flexible. For instance, let’s just randomly add another entity to the json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the llm will reply with no change to the prompt:\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nThis is effectively magic. ;)\n\nNow weave it all together with a simple python or node app, and BAM - you have a bot that will tell you what to wear every morning based on structured weather data that you don’t have to be careful about.\n\nHilariously, when building this type of app - if there is an error, the LLM will interpret the error with the same prompt:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nI use this pattern constantly. I mostly build lil bots that hang out and tell me things:\n\n- Sleep performance analysis\n- Weather bot\n- [Chicago Alerts twitter account](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- Sensor decisions for my e-ink ambient displays\n\n(_Never fear, I will document all of these later._)\n\n## Back to the office\n\nIn early 2023 my company was spiraling and I started spending a lot of time hacking on projects to clear my mind. I also started spending a lot more deliberate time in my office with the team. The limitations of the previous iteration of state based automatons started to show.\n\nArmed with this new paradigm, and a sudden influx of time, I decided to redo the notifications in the office.\n\nFirst, I prototyped the system by catching the sensor data and manually sending it to ChatGPT and seeing how it would react. It was pretty straight forward, and obviously very prompt dependent.\n\nHere is the first prompt we used\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n\n```\n\nI would pass in the default state so the Llm would know what status quo was, then I would pass in the current state, and as a wild card I passed in the last state.\n\nFor instance if this was a door:\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” } `\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nThe LLM may reply:\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\nIt saw that there isn’t a change, and told us the state. If we close the door, the llm says:\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nThis was really compelling. Kind of annoying, but compelling!\n\nNow it was time to pass a WHOLE bunch of signals to the LLM and see what happens.\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nThe main problem with this approach is that you don’t want an announcement every time a sensor changes. Since our goal was to make something better than the state based approach from 2019, we needed to group the sensors.\n\nI decided to make a really simple flask app that ultimately just collected json data from sensors over MQTT and then after a certain set of parameters (time, velocity and count) it would push bunch of the json states into one payload.\n\nThe objects look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nWhich would translate into:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFrom here it is passed to Openai to turn this json into prose:\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nThis all happens via my friend, and yours: `mqtt`.\n\nI then have a home assistant send that sends sensor changes down the wire to be collected and transformed.\n\nFast change Automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nAs you can see, both of these require that the office is “occupied” for the automation to fire. Since it costs money to generate the responses, I don’t want it to be talking about air quality when we are gone ;)\n\nI have two automations because some states are slow (air quality, physical space presence), and some are fast (personal presence, doors, AC, etc).\n\nThe automations are pretty simple: They look for state change, and then push the state change to the mqtt topic.\n\nThis works surprisingly well. Since it a home assistant automation, I can add any home assistant sensor to the agent and it will chat about it.\n\nI also have the prompt broken out separately so I can iterate on it without having to restart the entire stack. This is super helpful when you are tuning the sarcasm for your office.\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nOnce this was all built and working I decided that I wanted the office to see. As I type this, it seems like maybe it is a bad idea. However, it is hilarious.\n\nI wrote a really stupid piece of code that triggers with a motion sensor, grabs a snapshot from a security camera, and then hits a box running LLAVA and then returns json of what was on the security camera at the time of motion.\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\nThis works surprisingly well.\n\nThen I just push this json into the sensor collector and have it act like another sensor.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhich will result in:\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nThe agent can see! This added another level:\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\nQuickly followed by:\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\nAnother example where it talked about clothing:\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## All together now\n\nOnce this was all wired together we had magical experiences like this when I left the office the other day:\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nAnd now our office discord (no more slack?!) looks like this:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"The discord is popping\">}}\n\nWe are constantly iterating on the prompt and the sensors to get it to sit between annoying and funny. It is a wafer thin line.\n\nBecause the system is expecting a json payload, it is really easy to extend the agent to react to other sensors.\n\n**Hearing is next**\n\n## Codes! You can run this yourself.\n\nAll of the code is open source. It isn't pretty, and isn't mostly written by LLM. But it works well.\n\nThe code that does the sensor grabbing / LLM funny stuff here: [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)\n\nThe code for the eyeballs are here: [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\nI imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless. This code has been running without many tweaks for the last 6-8 months. It is constantly hilarious and always brings a smile to us occupants and a “wtf” from our visitor friends. If you do take a swing at it - let me know. Also, if you have any trouble, send me an [email](mailto:harper@modest.com) and maybe I can help!\n\nMy prediction is that this will be doable inside of home assistant shortly.\n\n**Part 2 will drop later. I will update yall on how we used a vtuber rig to give the agent a body**",

      "response": "**tl;dr:** _センサーをたくさん使い、LLMでオフィスに状況をしゃべらせています。記事は長いですが内容はシンプル。私が実生活でLLMをどう使っているかを示す良いデモです。_\n\n2019 年、友人の Ivan と私はシカゴにあるこの [最高のスタジオ](https://company.lol) で仕事を始めました。基本的に好き勝手に楽しいものを作りまくっています。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\n最初の頃は、オフィスにセンサーと自動化を追加することに時間を費やしました。狙いは、いつでもオフィスの環境などを把握できるようにすることでした。\n\n[Home Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) を使ってすべてのセンサーを一つのプラットフォームに集約し、状態をアナウンスする退屈なオートメーションをいくつか作りました。\n\n通知内容はとてもシンプル：\n\n- 人が到着したときにアナウンス\n- 室温が高すぎる／低すぎるときにアナウンス\n- CO₂ レベルが高すぎるときにアナウンス\n- ドアが開閉したときに音を鳴らす（コンビニの「チリン♪」音）\n\n通知は Slack と、マイクを無効にした古い Google Home スピーカーへ送信しました。スピーカーは音質も良く、真ん中の天井 12 フィート（約 3.6 m）あたりに設置したので、部屋全体から聞こえる感じになります。もし “通知用スピーカー” を探しているなら、かなりアリです。\n\nここに通知例があります：\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nご覧の通り、効果はあるけど超退屈。\n\nオフィスにいるときはもちろん、外出時にはさらに役立ちました。Covid 初期で何も分からなかった頃、遠隔でオフィスの状態を監視できるのは安心でした。\n\nオフィスにいる間は、アナウンスや環境音的な通知が未来感を演出してくれます。まるでオフィスが状況を把握してちょっとした人格を持っているみたい。\n\nこのあと、何が起こるかなんて想像もしていませんでした……\n\n## json シンギュラリがやって来た\n\n今や LLM 革命がすべてをぶっ壊しつつあり、今後数年間で知識労働は変でワイルドで楽しくて複雑になるでしょう。\n\nGPT-3 が 2020 年に公開されるや否や、私は変なソフトを作り始めました。日常でどう活用するかを考えまくり、たくさんの “Bot” を作成。多くはけっこう「個人的」なトーンの出力でした。\n\n私のお気に入りの “新たな” テクは、構造化された `JSON` を LLM で **文章** に変換すること。ここで言う文章は詩ではなく、普通の文です。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\n具体的にはこんな JSON を用意して：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nそのうえでおもしろいプロンプトを追加します：\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nこれを `GPT-4-turbo` に渡すと、こんな返事が戻ってきます：\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nシンプルですよね。しかも JSON をあらかじめ厳密に定義しておく必要がほとんどありません。LLM は **非常に** 柔軟なんです。たとえば項目をランダムに追加してみても——\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nプロンプトを変えずにこんな返事が：\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nまさに魔法。 ;)\n\nこれを Python か Node の簡単なアプリに組み込めば、天気データから毎朝「何を着るべきか」を教えてくれる Bot が完成します。しかも JSON の形式をあれこれ気にしなくて OK。\n\n笑えるのは、アプリ開発中にエラーが出ても LLM が同じプロンプトでそれを解釈してしまうこと：\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\n私はこのパターンを常用しています。主にこんな小さな Bot を作って遊ばせています：\n\n- 睡眠パフォーマンス分析\n- 天気 Bot\n- [Chicago Alerts のツイッターアカウント](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- 電子ペーパーのアンビエントディスプレイ用センサー判断\n\n(_安心してください、これらも後で全部まとめます。_)\n\n## オフィスに戻ろう\n\n2023 年初頭、会社が大混乱に陥り、頭をリセットするためにプロジェクトをハックしまくっていました。同時に、チームとオフィスで意識的に過ごす時間も増加。2019 年版の状態ベース自動化の限界が見えてきました。\n\n新しいパラダイムと湧き出る時間を武器に、オフィスの通知を作り直すことに。\n\nまずセンサーデータをキャプチャし、ChatGPT に手動で投げて反応を確認。シンプルで、当然ながらプロンプト依存でした。\n\n最初に使ったプロンプトはこちら：\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n\n```\n\nここで default_state を渡して “通常状態” を知らせ、current_state に現在の状態、さらに last_state をおまけで投入。\n\nたとえばドアの場合：\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nLLM の返答はこんな感じ：\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\n変化がないと判断し、その旨を報告。ドアを閉めると——\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\n——のように返してくれます。ちょっとウザいけど魅力的！\n\nここで大量のシグナルを LLM に渡したらどうなるか、試すことにしました。\n\n## センサー束ね作戦\n\nこのアプローチの問題は、センサーが変わるたびに毎回アナウンスされたらイヤってこと。2019 年版を超えるため、センサーをグルーピングする必要がありました。\n\nそこで簡単な Flask アプリを作成。MQTT 経由で JSON を受け取り、一定の条件（時間・変化速度・件数）でまとめて一つのペイロードにします。\n\nオブジェクトはこんな形：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nこれをバッチにすると：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nここから OpenAI に渡して文章化：\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed.

      "user_prompt": "# ORIGINAL TEXT\n**tl;dr:** _I use a bunch of sensors, and an LLM to make my office talk to us about what’s going on in the office. This is a long post, but should be pretty straight forward. Generally, this is a good demonstration of how I have been using LLMs in my real life._\n\nIn 2019 my buddy Ivan and I started working in this [amazing studio](https://company.lol) here in Chicago. Mostly we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\nEarly on, one of the main things I spent my time building was adding some sensors and automation to the office. My goal was to have insight into the environment, etc of the office at any time.\n\nWe used [home assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) to collect all the sensors into one platform. I built some really boring automations that would announce various states.\n\nThe notifications were pretty straight forward:\n\n- Announcing when a person arrived\n- Announcing when the temperature is too hot, too cold\n- Announcing when the CO2 level is too high\n- Making a noise when the door is open or closed (convenience store door noise)\n\nWe pushed the notifications to a slack and a an old google home speaker with the mic disabled. The speaker worked well and sounds pretty good. We placed it about 12 feet up, in the very middle of the space - so it sounds like it is coming from everywhere. If you are looking for an “notification speaker,” these are pretty solid.\n\nHere is an example of the notifications:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nAs you can see it is effective, but pretty boring.\n\nThe notifications were super helpful when we were in the office, and even more helpful when we were gone. In the beginning of Covid when nobody knew anything, it was nice to be able to monitor the state of the office remotely.\n\nWhile in the office, the announcements and various other ambient notifications made the office feel futuristic. Like the office knew what was going on and had a bit of personality.\n\nWe had no idea what was coming next...\n\n## The json-singularity is here.\n\nWe all know now that this LLM revolution is fucking everything up, and probably will make most knowledge work weird, wild, fun and complicated over the next few years.\n\nWhen GPT-3 was released in 2020, I immediately started building weird software to use it. I started thinking a lot about how to use this technology in my every day. I built lots of “bots.” Most of them had a very “personal” tone to their output.\n\nMy favorite \"emergent\" trick is to take structured `JSON` data and convert it to **prose** via the LLM. When I say prose, I don't mean poems. I mean words and sentences.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\nSpecifically I take json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nThen add a fun prompt:\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nPass it to `GPT-4-turbo` and get this:\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nPretty straight forward. What is really great, is that you don’t have to pre-define the json object. The llm is able to be **very** flexible. For instance, let’s just randomly add another entity to the json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the llm will reply with no change to the prompt:\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nThis is effectively magic. ;)\n\nNow weave it all together with a simple python or node app, and BAM - you have a bot that will tell you what to wear every morning based on structured weather data that you don’t have to be careful about.\n\nHilariously, when building this type of app - if there is an error, the LLM will interpret the error with the same prompt:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nI use this pattern constantly. I mostly build lil bots that hang out and tell me things:\n\n- Sleep performance analysis\n- Weather bot\n- [Chicago Alerts twitter account](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- Sensor decisions for my e-ink ambient displays\n\n(_Never fear, I will document all of these later._)\n\n## Back to the office\n\nIn early 2023 my company was spiraling and I started spending a lot of time hacking on projects to clear my mind. I also started spending a lot more deliberate time in my office with the team. The limitations of the previous iteration of state based automatons started to show.\n\nArmed with this new paradigm, and a sudden influx of time, I decided to redo the notifications in the office.\n\nFirst, I prototyped the system by catching the sensor data and manually sending it to ChatGPT and seeing how it would react. It was pretty straight forward, and obviously very prompt dependent.\n\nHere is the first prompt we used\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n\n```\n\nI would pass in the default state so the Llm would know what status quo was, then I would pass in the current state, and as a wild card I passed in the last state.\n\nFor instance if this was a door:\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” } `\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nThe LLM may reply:\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\nIt saw that there isn’t a change, and told us the state. If we close the door, the llm says:\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nThis was really compelling. Kind of annoying, but compelling!\n\nNow it was time to pass a WHOLE bunch of signals to the LLM and see what happens.\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nThe main problem with this approach is that you don’t want an announcement every time a sensor changes. Since our goal was to make something better than the state based approach from 2019, we needed to group the sensors.\n\nI decided to make a really simple flask app that ultimately just collected json data from sensors over MQTT and then after a certain set of parameters (time, velocity and count) it would push bunch of the json states into one payload.\n\nThe objects look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nWhich would translate into:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFrom here it is passed to Openai to turn this json into prose:\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nThis all happens via my friend, and yours: `mqtt`.\n\nI then have a home assistant send that sends sensor changes down the wire to be collected and transformed.\n\nFast change Automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nAs you can see, both of these require that the office is “occupied” for the automation to fire. Since it costs money to generate the responses, I don’t want it to be talking about air quality when we are gone ;)\n\nI have two automations because some states are slow (air quality, physical space presence), and some are fast (personal presence, doors, AC, etc).\n\nThe automations are pretty simple: They look for state change, and then push the state change to the mqtt topic.\n\nThis works surprisingly well. Since it a home assistant automation, I can add any home assistant sensor to the agent and it will chat about it.\n\nI also have the prompt broken out separately so I can iterate on it without having to restart the entire stack. This is super helpful when you are tuning the sarcasm for your office.\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nOnce this was all built and working I decided that I wanted the office to see. As I type this, it seems like maybe it is a bad idea. However, it is hilarious.\n\nI wrote a really stupid piece of code that triggers with a motion sensor, grabs a snapshot from a security camera, and then hits a box running LLAVA and then returns json of what was on the security camera at the time of motion.\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\nThis works surprisingly well.\n\nThen I just push this json into the sensor collector and have it act like another sensor.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhich will result in:\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nThe agent can see! This added another level:\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\nQuickly followed by:\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\nAnother example where it talked about clothing:\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## All together now\n\nOnce this was all wired together we had magical experiences like this when I left the office the other day:\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nAnd now our office discord (no more slack?!) looks like this:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"The discord is popping\">}}\n\nWe are constantly iterating on the prompt and the sensors to get it to sit between annoying and funny. It is a wafer thin line.\n\nBecause the system is expecting a json payload, it is really easy to extend the agent to react to other sensors.\n\n**Hearing is next**\n\n## Codes! You can run this yourself.\n\nAll of the code is open source. It isn't pretty, and isn't mostly written by LLM. But it works well.\n\nThe code that does the sensor grabbing / LLM funny stuff here: [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)\n\nThe code for the eyeballs are here: [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\nI imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless. This code has been running without many tweaks for the last 6-8 months. It is constantly hilarious and always brings a smile to us occupants and a “wtf” from our visitor friends. If you do take a swing at it - let me know. Also, if you have any trouble, send me an [email](mailto:harper@modest.com) and maybe I can help!\n\nMy prediction is that this will be doable inside of home assistant shortly.\n\n**Part 2 will drop later. I will update yall on how we used a vtuber rig to give the agent a body**\n\n# TRANSLATED TEXT\n**tl;dr:** _センサーをたくさん使い、LLMでオフィスに状況をしゃべらせています。記事は長いですが内容はシンプル。私が実生活でLLMをどう使っているかを示す良いデモです。_\n\n2019 年、友人の Ivan と私はシカゴにあるこの [最高のスタジオ](https://company.lol) で仕事を始めました。基本的に好き勝手に楽しいものを作りまくっています。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\n最初の頃は、オフィスにセンサーと自動化を追加することに時間を費やしました。狙いは、いつでもオフィスの環境などを把握できるようにすることでした。\n\n[Home Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) を使ってすべてのセンサーを一つのプラットフォームに集約し、状態をアナウンスする退屈なオートメーションをいくつか作りました。\n\n通知内容はとてもシンプル：\n\n- 人が到着したときにアナウンス\n- 室温が高すぎる／低すぎるときにアナウンス\n- CO₂ レベルが高すぎるときにアナウンス\n- ドアが開閉したときに音を鳴らす（コンビニの「チリン♪」音）\n\n通知は Slack と、マイクを無効にした古い Google Home スピーカーへ送信しました。スピーカーは音質も良く、真ん中の天井 12 フィート（約 3.6 m）あたりに設置したので、部屋全体から聞こえる感じになります。もし “通知用スピーカー” を探しているなら、かなりアリです。\n\nここに通知例があります：\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nご覧の通り、効果はあるけど超退屈。\n\nオフィスにいるときはもちろん、外出時にはさらに役立ちました。Covid 初期で何も分からなかった頃、遠隔でオフィスの状態を監視できるのは安心でした。\n\nオフィスにいる間は、アナウンスや環境音的な通知が未来感を演出してくれます。まるでオフィスが状況を把握してちょっとした人格を持っているみたい。\n\nこのあと、何が起こるかなんて想像もしていませんでした……\n\n## json シンギュラリがやって来た\n\n今や LLM 革命がすべてをぶっ壊しつつあり、今後数年間で知識労働は変でワイルドで楽しくて複雑になるでしょう。\n\nGPT-3 が 2020 年に公開されるや否や、私は変なソフトを作り始めました。日常でどう活用するかを考えまくり、たくさんの “Bot” を作成。多くはけっこう「個人的」なトーンの出力でした。\n\n私のお気に入りの “新たな” テクは、構造化された `JSON` を LLM で **文章** に変換すること。ここで言う文章は詩ではなく、普通の文です。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\n具体的にはこんな JSON を用意して：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nそのうえでおもしろいプロンプトを追加します：\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nこれを `GPT-4-turbo` に渡すと、こんな返事が戻ってきます：\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nシンプルですよね。しかも JSON をあらかじめ厳密に定義しておく必要がほとんどありません。LLM は **非常に** 柔軟なんです。たとえば項目をランダムに追加してみても——\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nプロンプトを変えずにこんな返事が：\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nまさに魔法。 ;)\n\nこれを Python か Node の簡単なアプリに組み込めば、天気データから毎朝「何を着るべきか」を教えてくれる Bot が完成します。しかも JSON の形式をあれこれ気にしなくて OK。\n\n笑えるのは、アプリ開発中にエラーが出ても LLM が同じプロンプトでそれを解釈してしまうこと：\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\n私はこのパターンを常用しています。主にこんな小さな Bot を作って遊ばせています：\n\n- 睡眠パフォーマンス分析\n- 天気 Bot\n- [Chicago Alerts のツイッターアカウント](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- 電子ペーパーのアンビエントディスプレイ用センサー判断\n\n(_安心してください、これらも後で全部まとめます。_)\n\n## オフィスに戻ろう\n\n2023 年初頭、会社が大混乱に陥り、頭をリセットするためにプロジェクトをハックしまくっていました。同時に、チームとオフィスで意識的に過ごす時間も増加。2019 年版の状態ベース自動化の限界が見えてきました。\n\n新しいパラダイムと湧き出る時間を武器に、オフィスの通知を作り直すことに。\n\nまずセンサーデータをキャプチャし、ChatGPT に手動で投げて反応を確認。シンプルで、当然ながらプロンプト依存でした。\n\n最初に使ったプロンプトはこちら：\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n\n```\n\nここで default_state を渡して “通常状態” を知らせ、current_state に現在の状態、さらに last_state をおまけで投入。\n\nたとえばドアの場合：\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nLLM の返答はこんな感じ：\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\n変化がないと判断し、その旨を報告。ドアを閉めると——\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\n——のように返してくれます。ちょっとウザいけど魅力的！\n\nここで大量のシグナルを LLM に渡したらどうなるか、試すことにしました。\n\n## センサー束ね作戦\n\nこのアプローチの問題は、センサーが変わるたびに毎回アナウンスされたらイヤってこと。2019 年版を超えるため、センサーをグルーピングする必要がありました。\n\nそこで簡単な Flask アプリを作成。MQTT 経由で JSON を受け取り、一定の条件（時間・変化速度・件数）でまとめて一つのペイロードにします。\n\nオブジェクトはこんな形：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nこれをバッチにすると：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nここから OpenAI に渡して文章化：\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nすべて我らが友、`mqtt` 経由で行われます。\n\nHome Assistant からセンサーの変化を MQTT に流し、収集＆変換させています。\n\nFast change Automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nどちらも「オフィスが occupied＝在室中」のときだけ発火します。レスポンス生成にはコストがかかるので、不在時に空気質についてしゃべられても困りますからね ;)\n\nオートメーションはシンプルで、状態変化を検知したらその情報を MQTT トピックへ送るだけ。\n\nHome Assistant のセンサーなら何でもこのエージェントに追加できるので、とても拡張しやすいです。\n\nプロンプトは別ファイルにしているので、スタックを再起動せずに皮肉度合いを調整できるのも便利。\n\n## で、カメラ＝「目」を付けたらどうなる？\n\n一式が動くようになったら、オフィスに「視覚」を持たせたくなりました。書きながら「ヤバいかも」と思いつつ、でも面白いので実装。\n\n動体センサーでトリガーし、防犯カメラのスナップショットを取得。LLAVA を動かしているマシンへ送り、写っている内容を JSON で返すという超おバカコードを書きました。\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\n意外とちゃんと動きます。\n\nあとはこの JSON をセンサー収集機に流し込み、普通のセンサーとして扱うだけ。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nするとこんな返事に：\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nエージェントが「見える」ようになりました！さらに——\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\n続けざまに——\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\n服装ネタまで：\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## まとめ\n\n先日私がオフィスを出たときには、こんなマジカルなメッセージが：\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nいまやオフィスの Discord（もう Slack じゃない！）はこんな感じ：\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"The discord is popping\">}}\n\nうるさすぎず面白いギリギリのラインを探しつつ、プロンプトとセンサーをひたすらチューニング中。\n\nJSON ペイロードを想定しているので、ほかのセンサーを追加するのも超ラクです。\n\n**次は「聴覚」を付ける予定**\n\n## コード！あなたも動かせます\n\nコードはすべてオープンソース。美しくはないし、ほとんど LLM が書いてもいません（笑）が、ちゃんと動きます。\n\nセンサー取得／LLM でおふざけする部分のコード： [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)\n\nカメラ（目玉）用コード： [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\n配線はそこまで難しくないと思いますが、完全自動ではありません。このコードはここ 6〜8 か月ほぼノーメンテで稼働中。私たち入居者は毎回ニヤニヤ、来訪者は「何これｗ」。試してみたら教えてください。困ったら [メール](mailto:harper@modest.com) くれれば手を貸せるかも！\n\n近い将来、Home Assistant だけで完結できるようになると予想しています。\n\n**Part 2 は後日公開予定。VTuber リグでエージェントに身体を与えた話をお楽しみに！**\n\nPlease review and improve the translated text to make it natural and accurate in japanese.\nReturn ONLY the improved translated text without explanations or comments.",

      "user_prompt": "# ORIGINAL TEXT\n**tl;dr:** _I use a bunch of sensors, and an LLM to make my office talk to us about what’s going on in the office. This is a long post, but should be pretty straight forward. Generally, this is a good demonstration of how I have been using LLMs in my real life._\n\nIn 2019 my buddy Ivan and I started working in this [amazing studio](https://company.lol) here in Chicago. Mostly we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\nEarly on, one of the main things I spent my time building was adding some sensors and automation to the office. My goal was to have insight into the environment, etc of the office at any time.\n\nWe used [home assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) to collect all the sensors into one platform. I built some really boring automations that would announce various states.\n\nThe notifications were pretty straight forward:\n\n- Announcing when a person arrived\n- Announcing when the temperature is too hot, too cold\n- Announcing when the CO2 level is too high\n- Making a noise when the door is open or closed (convenience store door noise)\n\nWe pushed the notifications to a slack and a an old google home speaker with the mic disabled. The speaker worked well and sounds pretty good. We placed it about 12 feet up, in the very middle of the space - so it sounds like it is coming from everywhere. If you are looking for an “notification speaker,” these are pretty solid.\n\nHere is an example of the notifications:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nAs you can see it is effective, but pretty boring.\n\nThe notifications were super helpful when we were in the office, and even more helpful when we were gone. In the beginning of Covid when nobody knew anything, it was nice to be able to monitor the state of the office remotely.\n\nWhile in the office, the announcements and various other ambient notifications made the office feel futuristic. Like the office knew what was going on and had a bit of personality.\n\nWe had no idea what was coming next...\n\n## The json-singularity is here.\n\nWe all know now that this LLM revolution is fucking everything up, and probably will make most knowledge work weird, wild, fun and complicated over the next few years.\n\nWhen GPT-3 was released in 2020, I immediately started building weird software to use it. I started thinking a lot about how to use this technology in my every day. I built lots of “bots.” Most of them had a very “personal” tone to their output.\n\nMy favorite \"emergent\" trick is to take structured `JSON` data and convert it to **prose** via the LLM. When I say prose, I don't mean poems. I mean words and sentences.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\nSpecifically I take json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nThen add a fun prompt:\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nPass it to `GPT-4-turbo` and get this:\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nPretty straight forward. What is really great, is that you don’t have to pre-define the json object. The llm is able to be **very** flexible. For instance, let’s just randomly add another entity to the json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the llm will reply with no change to the prompt:\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nThis is effectively magic. ;)\n\nNow weave it all together with a simple python or node app, and BAM - you have a bot that will tell you what to wear every morning based on structured weather data that you don’t have to be careful about.\n\nHilariously, when building this type of app - if there is an error, the LLM will interpret the error with the same prompt:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nI use this pattern constantly. I mostly build lil bots that hang out and tell me things:\n\n- Sleep performance analysis\n- Weather bot\n- [Chicago Alerts twitter account](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- Sensor decisions for my e-ink ambient displays\n\n(_Never fear, I will document all of these later._)\n\n## Back to the office\n\nIn early 2023 my company was spiraling and I started spending a lot of time hacking on projects to clear my mind. I also started spending a lot more deliberate time in my office with the team. The limitations of the previous iteration of state based automatons started to show.\n\nArmed with this new paradigm, and a sudden influx of time, I decided to redo the notifications in the office.\n\nFirst, I prototyped the system by catching the sensor data and manually sending it to ChatGPT and seeing how it would react. It was pretty straight forward, and obviously very prompt dependent.\n\nHere is the first prompt we used\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n\n```\n\nI would pass in the default state so the Llm would know what status quo was, then I would pass in the current state, and as a wild card I passed in the last state.\n\nFor instance if this was a door:\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” } `\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nThe LLM may reply:\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\nIt saw that there isn’t a change, and told us the state. If we close the door, the llm says:\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nThis was really compelling. Kind of annoying, but compelling!\n\nNow it was time to pass a WHOLE bunch of signals to the LLM and see what happens.\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nThe main problem with this approach is that you don’t want an announcement every time a sensor changes. Since our goal was to make something better than the state based approach from 2019, we needed to group the sensors.\n\nI decided to make a really simple flask app that ultimately just collected json data from sensors over MQTT and then after a certain set of parameters (time, velocity and count) it would push bunch of the json states into one payload.\n\nThe objects look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nWhich would translate into:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFrom here it is passed to Openai to turn this json into prose:\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nThis all happens via my friend, and yours: `mqtt`.\n\nI then have a home assistant send that sends sensor changes down the wire to be collected and transformed.\n\nFast change Automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nAs you can see, both of these require that the office is “occupied” for the automation to fire. Since it costs money to generate the responses, I don’t want it to be talking about air quality when we are gone ;)\n\nI have two automations because some states are slow (air quality, physical space presence), and some are fast (personal presence, doors, AC, etc).\n\nThe automations are pretty simple: They look for state change, and then push the state change to the mqtt topic.\n\nThis works surprisingly well. Since it a home assistant automation, I can add any home assistant sensor to the agent and it will chat about it.\n\nI also have the prompt broken out separately so I can iterate on it without having to restart the entire stack. This is super helpful when you are tuning the sarcasm for your office.\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nOnce this was all built and working I decided that I wanted the office to see. As I type this, it seems like maybe it is a bad idea. However, it is hilarious.\n\nI wrote a really stupid piece of code that triggers with a motion sensor, grabs a snapshot from a security camera, and then hits a box running LLAVA and then returns json of what was on the security camera at the time of motion.\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\nThis works surprisingly well.\n\nThen I just push this json into the sensor collector and have it act like another sensor.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhich will result in:\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nThe agent can see! This added another level:\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\nQuickly followed by:\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\nAnother example where it talked about clothing:\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## All together now\n\nOnce this was all wired together we had magical experiences like this when I left the office the other day:\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nAnd now our office discord (no more slack?!) looks like this:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"The discord is popping\">}}\n\nWe are constantly iterating on the prompt and the sensors to get it to sit between annoying and funny. It is a wafer thin line.\n\nBecause the system is expecting a json payload, it is really easy to extend the agent to react to other sensors.\n\n**Hearing is next**\n\n## Codes! You can run this yourself.\n\nAll of the code is open source. It isn't pretty, and isn't mostly written by LLM. But it works well.\n\nThe code that does the sensor grabbing / LLM funny stuff here: [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)\n\nThe code for the eyeballs are here: [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\nI imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless. This code has been running without many tweaks for the last 6-8 months. It is constantly hilarious and always brings a smile to us occupants and a “wtf” from our visitor friends. If you do take a swing at it - let me know. Also, if you have any trouble, send me an [email](mailto:harper@modest.com) and maybe I can help!\n\nMy prediction is that this will be doable inside of home assistant shortly.\n\n**Part 2 will drop later. I will update yall on how we used a vtuber rig to give the agent a body**\n\n# CURRENT TRANSLATION\n**tl;dr:** _いろんなセンサーと LLM を組み合わせて、オフィスが今なにが起きているかしゃべるようにした。記事は長いけど筋はシンプル。リアルライフで LLM をどう使っているかの実例だよ。_\n\n2019 年、相棒の Ivan と僕はシカゴの [amazing studio](https://company.lol) で仕事を始めた。だいたい好き勝手に面白いものを作って遊んでいる。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\n最初に手を付けたのは、オフィスにセンサーと自動化を入れていつでも環境を把握できるようにすることだった。\n\n[Home Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) にすべてのセンサーを集約し、ごくシンプルな自動化をいくつか書いた。\n\n通知内容は本当に基本的なもの：\n\n- 人が来たときにアナウンス  \n- 室温が高すぎ／低すぎのときにアナウンス  \n- CO₂ 濃度が高いときにアナウンス  \n- ドアが開閉すると（コンビニの自動ドアみたいに）「チリン♪」と鳴らす  \n\n通知は Slack と、マイクを無効にした古い Google Home スピーカーに送っている。スピーカーは音が良くて、部屋の中央 12 フィートほどの高さに設置してあるので音が四方から聞こえてくる。通知専用スピーカーを探しているならおすすめだ。\n\n通知の例はこちら：\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"役には立つけど賢さゼロで退屈\">}}\n\n効果はあるけれど面白みはない。\n\nオフィスにいるときはもちろん、離れているときにも便利だった。特に Covid 初期で先が見えなかった頃は、遠隔でオフィスの状態を確認できて助かった。\n\n室内にいるあいだ、アナウンスや環境音が流れることで「オフィスに人格がある」ような近未来感も味わえた。\n\nでも、次に来る展開は想像していなかった……。\n\n## The json-singularity is here.\n\nLLM 革命があらゆるものを揺さぶっていて、これから数年で知識労働の形はワイルドで複雑になるのは間違いない。\n\n2020 年に GPT-3 が公開された瞬間、僕はすぐにいろいろなソフトを作り始めた。日常でどう使えるか考えながら、たくさんの “bot” を作り、ほとんどがとても「個人的」な語り口になった。\n\nお気に入りの“発見”は、構造化された `JSON` データを LLM で **文章**に変換させることだ。詩ではなく、普通の文章ね。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\nたとえばこんな JSON を用意して──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\n軽いプロンプトを付ける：\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nこれを `GPT-4-turbo` に投げると、\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nと返ってくる。しかも JSON のフォーマットを厳密に決めておく必要もない。LLM がとても柔軟に対応してくれる。ためしにフィールドを一つ増やしてみても──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\n同じプロンプトでこんな返答が得られる。\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nまるで魔法だ。\n\nこれを簡単な Python か Node のスクリプトと組み合わせれば、天気データに基づいて毎朝「今日の服装」を教えてくれる bot が出来上がる。JSON が多少変わっても平気だ。\n\n笑えるのは、エラーが返ってきても LLM が同じノリでコメントしてくること。\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nこの手法はしょっちゅう使っていて、周りに小さな bot をいくつも走らせている。\n\n- 睡眠パフォーマンス解析  \n- 天気 bot  \n- [Chicago Alerts Twitter アカウント](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)  \n- E-Ink アンビエントディスプレイに表示する内容の決定  \n\n(_これらは後日あらためてまとめる予定。_)\n\n## Back to the office\n\n2023 年のはじめ、会社が下降線を描く中で気分転換にプロジェクトをいじりまくり、チームと一緒にオフィスで過ごす時間も意識的に増やしていた。その結果、2019 年に作った状態ベースの自動化の限界が見え始めた。\n\n新しいパラダイムとまとまった時間を得たので、通知システムを作り直すことにした。\n\nまずはセンサーデータを取り込んで手動で ChatGPT に投げ、反応を確認。プロンプトに大きく依存するが流れは簡単だった。\n\n最初のプロンプトはこれ：\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are an AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n```\n\n`default_state` が平常時、`current_state` が現在、`last_state` が直前の状態だ。\n\nドアの場合：\n\n- default_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"closed\" }`  \n- current_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`  \n- last_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`\n\nLLM の返答は、\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\n変化がなければこう返す。ドアを閉めると、\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\n少し騒がしいが面白い。\n\nでは、もっと多くの信号を渡したらどうなるか。\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nセンサーが変わるたびにアナウンスすると騒がしくなるので、2019 年版より良くするにはセンサーをまとめる必要があった。\n\nそこでシンプルな Flask アプリを作り、MQTT 経由で JSON データを受け取り、一定の条件（時間、変化速度（velocity）、件数）でまとめて 1 つのペイロードにすることにした。\n\n単体のオブジェクトはこう：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\n束ねるとこうなる：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nこれを OpenAI に渡すと、\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nすべては我らが相棒、`MQTT` を通じて行われる。\n\nHome Assistant のオートメーションがセンサー変化を MQTT に送り、Flask アプリが受け取って文章化する。\n\n### Fast change automation (5 seconds)\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\n### Slow change automation (5 minutes)\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nどちらも「オフィスが occupied=在室中」のときだけ発火する。生成コストがかかるので、誰もいないときに空気質の話をされても困るからね。\n\nオートメーションは単に状態変化を検知して MQTT に送るだけ。Home Assistant のセンサーなら何でも追加できる。\n\nプロンプトは別ファイルにしてあるので、スタックを再起動せずにユーモアの度合いを調整できる。これはとても便利だ。\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nシステムがうまく動き始めたころ、「オフィスに“目”を付けたらどうなる？」と思った。やりすぎかもしれないけれど、面白いに違いない。\n\nそこで、モーションセンサーをトリガーに防犯カメラのスナップショットを取得し、LLAVA を動かして写っているものを JSON で返す簡単なコードを書いた。\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\n意外なほどよく機能する。\n\nそしてその JSON をほかのセンサーと同じように MQTT に流すだけ。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nすると LLM がこうコメントする。\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nエージェントが“見る”ようになった！\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\nさらに続く。\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\n服装にも言及。\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## All together now\n\n最近、僕がオフィスを出たときはこんなふうだった。\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nそしてオフィス Discord はこんな感じ：\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"The Discord is popping\">}}\n\n「うるさすぎず、でも面白い」の絶妙なラインを目指して、プロンプトとセンサーを日々調整している。\n\nシステムは JSON ペイロードを期待しているだけなので、新しいセンサーを追加するのも簡単だ。\n\n**次は“聴覚”を追加予定。**\n\n## Codes!

      "user_prompt": "# ORIGINAL TEXT\n**tl;dr:** _I use a bunch of sensors, and an LLM to make my office talk to us about what’s going on in the office. This is a long post, but should be pretty straight forward. Generally, this is a good demonstration of how I have been using LLMs in my real life._\n\nIn 2019 my buddy Ivan and I started working in this [amazing studio](https://company.lol) here in Chicago. Mostly we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\nEarly on, one of the main things I spent my time building was adding some sensors and automation to the office. My goal was to have insight into the environment, etc of the office at any time.\n\nWe used [home assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) to collect all the sensors into one platform. I built some really boring automations that would announce various states.\n\nThe notifications were pretty straight forward:\n\n- Announcing when a person arrived\n- Announcing when the temperature is too hot, too cold\n- Announcing when the CO2 level is too high\n- Making a noise when the door is open or closed (convenience store door noise)\n\nWe pushed the notifications to a slack and a an old google home speaker with the mic disabled. The speaker worked well and sounds pretty good. We placed it about 12 feet up, in the very middle of the space - so it sounds like it is coming from everywhere. If you are looking for an “notification speaker,” these are pretty solid.\n\nHere is an example of the notifications:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"Boring and not very smart\">}}\n\nAs you can see it is effective, but pretty boring.\n\nThe notifications were super helpful when we were in the office, and even more helpful when we were gone. In the beginning of Covid when nobody knew anything, it was nice to be able to monitor the state of the office remotely.\n\nWhile in the office, the announcements and various other ambient notifications made the office feel futuristic. Like the office knew what was going on and had a bit of personality.\n\nWe had no idea what was coming next...\n\n## The json-singularity is here.\n\nWe all know now that this LLM revolution is fucking everything up, and probably will make most knowledge work weird, wild, fun and complicated over the next few years.\n\nWhen GPT-3 was released in 2020, I immediately started building weird software to use it. I started thinking a lot about how to use this technology in my every day. I built lots of “bots.” Most of them had a very “personal” tone to their output.\n\nMy favorite \"emergent\" trick is to take structured `JSON` data and convert it to **prose** via the LLM. When I say prose, I don't mean poems. I mean words and sentences.\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\nSpecifically I take json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\nThen add a fun prompt:\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nPass it to `GPT-4-turbo` and get this:\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nPretty straight forward. What is really great, is that you don’t have to pre-define the json object. The llm is able to be **very** flexible. For instance, let’s just randomly add another entity to the json:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd the llm will reply with no change to the prompt:\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nThis is effectively magic. ;)\n\nNow weave it all together with a simple python or node app, and BAM - you have a bot that will tell you what to wear every morning based on structured weather data that you don’t have to be careful about.\n\nHilariously, when building this type of app - if there is an error, the LLM will interpret the error with the same prompt:\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nI use this pattern constantly. I mostly build lil bots that hang out and tell me things:\n\n- Sleep performance analysis\n- Weather bot\n- [Chicago Alerts twitter account](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)\n- Sensor decisions for my e-ink ambient displays\n\n(_Never fear, I will document all of these later._)\n\n## Back to the office\n\nIn early 2023 my company was spiraling and I started spending a lot of time hacking on projects to clear my mind. I also started spending a lot more deliberate time in my office with the team. The limitations of the previous iteration of state based automatons started to show.\n\nArmed with this new paradigm, and a sudden influx of time, I decided to redo the notifications in the office.\n\nFirst, I prototyped the system by catching the sensor data and manually sending it to ChatGPT and seeing how it would react. It was pretty straight forward, and obviously very prompt dependent.\n\nHere is the first prompt we used\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are a AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n\n```\n\nI would pass in the default state so the Llm would know what status quo was, then I would pass in the current state, and as a wild card I passed in the last state.\n\nFor instance if this was a door:\n\n- default_state: `{ “front_door”: “closed” }`\n- current_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” } `\n- last_state: `{ “front_door”: “open” }`\n\nThe LLM may reply:\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\nIt saw that there isn’t a change, and told us the state. If we close the door, the llm says:\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nThis was really compelling. Kind of annoying, but compelling!\n\nNow it was time to pass a WHOLE bunch of signals to the LLM and see what happens.\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nThe main problem with this approach is that you don’t want an announcement every time a sensor changes. Since our goal was to make something better than the state based approach from 2019, we needed to group the sensors.\n\nI decided to make a really simple flask app that ultimately just collected json data from sensors over MQTT and then after a certain set of parameters (time, velocity and count) it would push bunch of the json states into one payload.\n\nThe objects look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\nWhich would translate into:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFrom here it is passed to Openai to turn this json into prose:\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nThis all happens via my friend, and yours: `mqtt`.\n\nI then have a home assistant send that sends sensor changes down the wire to be collected and transformed.\n\nFast change Automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nSlow change automation:\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nAs you can see, both of these require that the office is “occupied” for the automation to fire. Since it costs money to generate the responses, I don’t want it to be talking about air quality when we are gone ;)\n\nI have two automations because some states are slow (air quality, physical space presence), and some are fast (personal presence, doors, AC, etc).\n\nThe automations are pretty simple: They look for state change, and then push the state change to the mqtt topic.\n\nThis works surprisingly well. Since it a home assistant automation, I can add any home assistant sensor to the agent and it will chat about it.\n\nI also have the prompt broken out separately so I can iterate on it without having to restart the entire stack. This is super helpful when you are tuning the sarcasm for your office.\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nOnce this was all built and working I decided that I wanted the office to see. As I type this, it seems like maybe it is a bad idea. However, it is hilarious.\n\nI wrote a really stupid piece of code that triggers with a motion sensor, grabs a snapshot from a security camera, and then hits a box running LLAVA and then returns json of what was on the security camera at the time of motion.\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\nThis works surprisingly well.\n\nThen I just push this json into the sensor collector and have it act like another sensor.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhich will result in:\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nThe agent can see! This added another level:\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit. Hopefully, he’s actually working and not just posing for a laptop ad\n\nQuickly followed by:\n\n> Looks like our male model in business casual traded standing for sitting. Riveting change. Now he's \"focused\" at his desk with his laptop. Work must go on, I guess.\n\nAnother example where it talked about clothing:\n\n> Oh look, the front door decided to close itself. And surprise, someone is gearing up to leave. Maybe they realized this is not a fashion show despite the all-black ensemble.\n\n## All together now\n\nOnce this was all wired together we had magical experiences like this when I left the office the other day:\n\n> The front door had a moment of indecision but eventually closed, and some mysterious middle-aged man with a penchant for black hats and serious expressions escaped the office. Oh, and the front door is now as secure as my sense of job satisfaction: locked.\n\nAnd now our office discord (no more slack?!) looks like this:\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-discord.png\" caption=\"The discord is popping\">}}\n\nWe are constantly iterating on the prompt and the sensors to get it to sit between annoying and funny. It is a wafer thin line.\n\nBecause the system is expecting a json payload, it is really easy to extend the agent to react to other sensors.\n\n**Hearing is next**\n\n## Codes! You can run this yourself.\n\nAll of the code is open source. It isn't pretty, and isn't mostly written by LLM. But it works well.\n\nThe code that does the sensor grabbing / LLM funny stuff here: [harperreed/houseagent](https://github.com/harperreed/houseagent)\n\nThe code for the eyeballs are here: [harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt](https://github.com/harperreed/eyeballs-mqtt)\n\nI imagine it isn’t super hard to wire together, but it isn’t seamless. This code has been running without many tweaks for the last 6-8 months. It is constantly hilarious and always brings a smile to us occupants and a “wtf” from our visitor friends. If you do take a swing at it - let me know. Also, if you have any trouble, send me an [email](mailto:harper@modest.com) and maybe I can help!\n\nMy prediction is that this will be doable inside of home assistant shortly.\n\n**Part 2 will drop later. I will update yall on how we used a vtuber rig to give the agent a body**\n\n# CURRENT TRANSLATION\n**tl;dr:** _いろんなセンサーと LLM を組み合わせて、オフィスが今なにが起きているかしゃべるようにした。記事は長いけど筋はシンプル。リアルライフで LLM をどう使っているかの実例だよ。_\n\n2019 年、相棒の Ivan と僕はシカゴの [amazing studio](https://company.lol) で仕事を始めた。だいたい好き勝手に面白いものを作って遊んでいる。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"Our amazing studio\">}}\n\n最初に手を付けたのは、オフィスにセンサーと自動化を入れていつでも環境を把握できるようにすることだった。\n\n[Home Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) にすべてのセンサーを集約し、ごくシンプルな自動化をいくつか書いた。\n\n通知内容は本当に基本的なもの：\n\n- 人が来たときにアナウンス  \n- 室温が高すぎ／低すぎのときにアナウンス  \n- CO₂ 濃度が高いときにアナウンス  \n- ドアが開閉すると（コンビニの自動ドアみたいに）「チリン♪」と鳴らす  \n\n通知は Slack と、マイクを無効にした古い Google Home スピーカーに送っている。スピーカーは音が良くて、部屋の中央 12 フィートほどの高さに設置してあるので音が四方から聞こえてくる。通知専用スピーカーを探しているならおすすめだ。\n\n通知の例はこちら：\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"役には立つけど賢さゼロで退屈\">}}\n\n効果はあるけれど面白みはない。\n\nオフィスにいるときはもちろん、離れているときにも便利だった。特に Covid 初期で先が見えなかった頃は、遠隔でオフィスの状態を確認できて助かった。\n\n室内にいるあいだ、アナウンスや環境音が流れることで「オフィスに人格がある」ような近未来感も味わえた。\n\nでも、次に来る展開は想像していなかった……。\n\n## The json-singularity is here.\n\nLLM 革命があらゆるものを揺さぶっていて、これから数年で知識労働の形はワイルドで複雑になるのは間違いない。\n\n2020 年に GPT-3 が公開された瞬間、僕はすぐにいろいろなソフトを作り始めた。日常でどう使えるか考えながら、たくさんの “bot” を作り、ほとんどがとても「個人的」な語り口になった。\n\nお気に入りの“発見”は、構造化された `JSON` データを LLM で **文章**に変換させることだ。詩ではなく、普通の文章ね。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"my new favorite graph\">}}\n\nたとえばこんな JSON を用意して──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\n軽いプロンプトを付ける：\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nこれを `GPT-4-turbo` に投げると、\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nと返ってくる。しかも JSON のフォーマットを厳密に決めておく必要もない。LLM がとても柔軟に対応してくれる。ためしにフィールドを一つ増やしてみても──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\n同じプロンプトでこんな返答が得られる。\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nまるで魔法だ。\n\nこれを簡単な Python か Node のスクリプトと組み合わせれば、天気データに基づいて毎朝「今日の服装」を教えてくれる bot が出来上がる。JSON が多少変わっても平気だ。\n\n笑えるのは、エラーが返ってきても LLM が同じノリでコメントしてくること。\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nこの手法はしょっちゅう使っていて、周りに小さな bot をいくつも走らせている。\n\n- 睡眠パフォーマンス解析  \n- 天気 bot  \n- [Chicago Alerts Twitter アカウント](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)  \n- E-Ink アンビエントディスプレイに表示する内容の決定  \n\n(_これらは後日あらためてまとめる予定。_)\n\n## Back to the office\n\n2023 年のはじめ、会社が下降線を描く中で気分転換にプロジェクトをいじりまくり、チームと一緒にオフィスで過ごす時間も意識的に増やしていた。その結果、2019 年に作った状態ベースの自動化の限界が見え始めた。\n\n新しいパラダイムとまとまった時間を得たので、通知システムを作り直すことにした。\n\nまずはセンサーデータを取り込んで手動で ChatGPT に投げ、反応を確認。プロンプトに大きく依存するが流れは簡単だった。\n\n最初のプロンプトはこれ：\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are an AI that controls a house.

The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\n変化がなければこう返す。ドアを閉めると、\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\n少し騒がしいが面白い。\n\nでは、もっと多くの信号を渡したらどうなるか。\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nセンサーが変わるたびにアナウンスすると騒がしくなるので、2019 年版より良くするにはセンサーをまとめる必要があった。\n\nそこでシンプルな Flask アプリを作り、MQTT 経由で JSON データを受け取り、一定の条件（時間、変化速度（velocity）、件数）でまとめて 1 つのペイロードにすることにした。\n\n単体のオブジェクトはこう：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\n束ねるとこうなる：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nこれを OpenAI に渡すと、\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nすべては我らが相棒、`MQTT` を通じて行われる。\n\nHome Assistant のオートメーションがセンサー変化を MQTT に送り、Flask アプリが受け取って文章化する。\n\n### Fast change automation (5 seconds)\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\n### Slow change automation (5 minutes)\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nどちらも「オフィスが occupied=在室中」のときだけ発火する。生成コストがかかるので、誰もいないときに空気質の話をされても困るからね。\n\nオートメーションは単に状態変化を検知して MQTT に送るだけ。Home Assistant のセンサーなら何でも追加できる。\n\nプロンプトは別ファイルにしてあるので、スタックを再起動せずにユーモアの度合いを調整できる。これはとても便利だ。\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nシステムがうまく動き始めたころ、「オフィスに“目”を付けたらどうなる？」と思った。やりすぎかもしれないけれど、面白いに違いない。\n\nそこで、モーションセンサーをトリガーに防犯カメラのスナップショットを取得し、LLAVA を動かして写っているものを JSON で返す簡単なコードを書いた。\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\n意外なほどよく機能する。\n\nそしてその JSON をほかのセンサーと同じように MQTT に流すだけ。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone.

      "response": "**tl;dr:** _いろんなセンサーと LLM をゴッソリ突っ込んで、オフィスが俺たち——そう、あんたも含めた **us**——に「いま何が起きてるか」しゃべり倒すようにしたぜ。記事は長いけど内容はシンプル。リアルライフで LLM をどうブッ込んでるかの実例だ。_\n\n2019 年、相棒 Ivan とオレらはシカゴの [amazing studio](https://company.lol) で仕事を始めた。基本オレら、ダラダラとクソ面白いモノを量産して遊んでるだけ。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office.webp\" caption=\"俺たちのクソ最高なスタジオ\">}}\n\nまず着手したのは、オフィスにセンサーと自動化を入れて環境をいつでも把握できるようにすること。\n\n[Home Assistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Assistant) に全部のセンサーを集約し、退屈きわまりない自動化をいくつか書いた。\n\n通知内容はホントにベタ:\n\n- 人が来たらアナウンス  \n- 室温がクソ暑い／クソ寒いときにアナウンス  \n- CO₂ 濃度がヤバいときにアナウンス  \n- ドアが開閉したらコンビニみたいにチリン♪と鳴らす  \n\n通知は Slack と、マイクを殺した古い Google Home スピーカーへ。音はそこそこいいし、部屋のド真ん中 12 フィート上に吊ってるから四方八方から聞こえる。通知専用スピーカー探してるなら悪くないぜ。\n\n通知の例はこんな感じ：\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/office-slack.png\" caption=\"頭はカラッポで正直退屈\">}}\n\n見てのとおり役には立つがクソつまらん。\n\nオフィスにいるときはもちろん、離れているときにも超便利だった。Covid 初期で誰も何もわからなかった頃、リモートでオフィスの状態を監視できたのはマジで助かった。\n\n室内にいるあいだはアナウンスと環境音のおかげで「オフィスに人格がある」みたいな近未来感があった。\n\nでも、次に来るカオスは想像もしなかった……。\n\n## JSON シンギュラリティがやって来た\n\nいまや LLM 革命があらゆるものをぶっ壊しつつあって、これから数年は知識労働がワイルドで複雑になるのは確実だ。\n\n2020 年に GPT-3 が出た瞬間、オレは即座に変なソフトを量産し始めた。日常でどうイジるか考えながら “bot” を山ほど作り、たいていは超 “個人的” な語り口になった。\n\n一番イカれた発見は、構造化された `JSON` データを LLM で **文章**に変換させること。詩じゃなく、普通の文章な。\n\n{{< image src=\"/images/posts/api-llm-lol.png\" caption=\"オレのお気に入りニューグラフ\">}}\n\nたとえばこんな JSON を用意して──\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\"\n}\n```\n\n軽いプロンプトを添える：\n\n> What should i wear. Be concise, have some personality. Think of this as a tweet telling people what to wear\n\nこれを `GPT-4-turbo` に投げると、\n\n> Brrr, it's 32°F and snowing! 🌨️ Bundle up in your coziest layers, don't forget a warm coat, gloves, and a hat. Snow boots are a must. Stay toasty, friends! #WinterWonderland #DressWarm\n\nと返ってくる。しかも JSON の項目をカッチリ決めなくても平気。LLM がクソ柔軟に噛み砕いてくれる。ためしにフィールドを一つ増やしても、\n\n```json\n{\n    \"current_temperature_f\": 32,\n    \"conditions\": \"snowing\",\n    \"air_quality\": \"really really bad\"\n}\n```\n\n同じプロンプトで――\n\n> Bundle up in your warmest gear & don't forget a mask! 🌨️❄️ With temps at freezing & air quality on the naughty list, it's all about layers & protection. #StayWarm #BreatheEasy\n\nこれ、マジで魔法。\n\nあとは Python か Node でチョロっと書けば、天気データを元に毎朝「今日の服装」を教えてくれる bot の完成。JSON が多少変形してもノープロブレム。\n\n笑えるのが、エラーが帰ってきても LLM が同じテンションでイジってくること。\n\n> Facing a 401 server error? Channel that frustration into fashion! Rock a bold, error-proof outfit today: a statement tee, comfy jeans, and sneakers that say 'I'm too fabulous for server issues.' 💻👖👟 #FashionFix #ServerChic\n\nこのパターンをオレは常用してて、周りに小さな bot をいくつも放し飼いにしている：\n\n- 睡眠パフォーマンス解析  \n- 天気 bot  \n- [Chicago Alerts Twitter アカウント](https://twitter.com/chicagoalerts)  \n- E-Ink アンビエントディスプレイの表示決定  \n\n(_これらはあとでちゃんと書くぜ。_)\n\n## Back to the office\n\n2023 年初頭、会社がガタガタで気晴らしにプロジェクトをハックしまくり、オフィスにも意識的に入り浸るようになった。2019 年に作った状態ベース自動化の限界が露呈し始めた。\n\n新しいパラダイムとヒマを手に入れたオレは、通知システムを作り直すことに。\n\nまずはセンサーデータを手動で ChatGPT に投げて挙動を確認。プロンプト依存だけど流れは単純。\n\n一発目のプロンプトはこれ：\n\n```text\nYou are HouseGPT.\n\nYou are an AI that controls a house. Similar to Jarvis in the iron man movies.\nYour job is to notify people in simple english what is happening in the house\nyou control. Your updates should be short and concise. Keep them tweet length.\n\nYou will be given the house default state. This is what the state the house\nis without any activity or movement. You will then get a current state. This\nis what is happening in the house right now.\n\nCompare the states and output your update. Ignore anything that hasn't\nchanged since the last state notification. Also ignore any state that\nis 'unknown.'\n\nDon't mention things you don't know about, and only mention what is in the\nstate update. Do not list out events. Just summarize.\n\nInterpret the co2 and airquality results into prose. Don't just return the\nvalues.\n\nRemember to use plain english. Have a playful personality. Use emojis.\nBe a bit like Hunter S Thompson.\n\nThe default state is:\n{default_state}\n\n# The current state is:\n{current_state}\n\n# The previous state was:\n{last_state}\n```\n\n`default_state` が平常時、`current_state` が現在。おまけ（ワイルドカード）的に `last_state` も投げてる。\n\nドアならこんな感じ：\n\n- default_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"closed\" }`  \n- current_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`  \n- last_state: `{ \"front_door\": \"open\" }`\n\nLLM の返答はこうだ：\n\n> No new updates, folks. The front door's still embracing the great outdoors! 🚪🌿\n\n変化ナシならこのとおり。ドアを閉めると、\n\n> Front door's shut tight now! 😎✌️ No more drafts or uninvited guests!\n\nちょっとウザいけど面白い。\n\nじゃあセンサーを山ほど投げたらどうなる？\n\n## Sensors bunches\n\nセンサーが変わるたびにアナウンスしたらウザすぎる。2019 年版を超えるにはセンサーを束ねる必要があった。\n\nそこでシンプルな Flask アプリを書いて、MQTT 経由で飛んでくる JSON を集め、一定の条件（時間・変化の速度・件数）でまとめて 1 ペイロードに。\n\n単体はこんな JSON：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n    \"from_state\": \"on\",\n    \"to_state\": \"off\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n}\n```\n\n束ねると：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"entity_id\": \"binary_sensor.front_door\",\n            \"from_state\": \"on\",\n            \"to_state\": \"off\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2024-03-25T13:50:01.289165-05:00\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nこれを OpenAI に渡すと、\n\n> Congratulations, the front door is now closed. One less way for the inevitable to find its way in. Keep up the vigilance; it might just prolong your survival.\n\nすべては我らが—もちろんあんたの—相棒 **MQTT** 経由で行われる。\n\nHome Assistant のオートメーションがセンサー変化を MQTT に送り、Flask アプリが受け取って文章化。\n\n### Fast change automation (5 seconds)\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 seconds)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - input_boolean.occupied\n          - lock.front_door\n          - binary_sensor.front_door\n          - switch.ac\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 0\n          seconds: 5\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\n### Slow change automation (5 minutes)\n\n```yaml\nalias: \"AI: State Router (5 minutes)\"\ndescription: \"\"\ntrigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id:\n          - sensor.airthings_wave_183519_co2\n          - binary_sensor.sitting_area_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.ivan_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.harper_desk_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.stereo_presence_sensor\n          - binary_sensor.tool_area_presence_sensor\n      for:\n          hours: 0\n          minutes: 5\n          seconds: 0\ncondition:\n    - condition: state\n      entity_id: input_boolean.occupied\n      state: \"on\"\naction:\n    - service: mqtt.publish\n      data:\n          qos: 0\n          retain: false\n          topic: hassevents/notifications\n          payload_template: |\n              {\n                \"entity_id\": \"{{ trigger.entity_id }}\",\n                \"from_state\": \"{{ trigger.from_state.state }}\",\n                \"to_state\": \"{{ trigger.to_state.state }}\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"{{ now().isoformat() }}\"\n              }\nmode: single\n```\n\nどちらも `input_boolean.occupied` (在室中) がオンのときだけ実行。金かけて生成するんだから、誰もいないときに空気質を語られても意味ねぇ。\n\nオートメーションは状態変化を検知して MQTT に流すだけ。Home Assistant のセンサーなら何でも追加可能。\n\nプロンプトは別ファイルにしてあるので、スタックを再起動せずに毒舌レベルをチューニングできる。これが超便利。\n\n## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!\n\nシステムが動き始めた頃、「オフィスに“目”を付けたらどうよ？」と思った。書きながらヤバい気もするが、面白さが勝つ。\n\nモーションセンサーをトリガーに防犯カメラのスナップを撮り、LLAVA で解析して JSON を返す雑なコードを書いた。\n\n```python\n(Missing code here)\n```\n\n意外としっかり動く。\n\nあとはその JSON を他のセンサーと同じように MQTT にブチ込むだけ。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"description of activity\": \"A man is standing in the office space, looking at his cell phone. He is wearing a white shirt and glasses. The office has a work table, chairs, and a stereo. There are also several potted plants and a TV in the room.\",\n    \"number of people\": \"1\",\n    \"people\": [\n        {\n            \"activity\": \"looking at cell phone\",\n            \"description of person\": {\n                \"accessories\": \"glasses\",\n                \"age\": \"30s\",\n                \"clothing\": \"white shirt\",\n                \"emotion\": \"neutral\",\n                \"gender\": \"male\",\n                \"hair\": \"beard\",\n                \"height\": \"tall\",\n                \"other\": \"wearing glasses\"\n            },\n            \"motivation\": \"checking messages or browsing the internet\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nすると LLM はこう吐く。\n\n> I managed to detect a man interacting with modern technology. Let's hope his browsing doesn’t lead him to discover how inconsequential we all are in the grand scheme of the universe\n\nエージェントが“見える”ようになった！\n\n> Look at Mr. Productivity over there, standing all tall, focused, and fashionable in his matching blue outfit.

Technical register  \n   - “flask app”→「Flask アプリ」は OK。ただし“Home Assistant automation” を「Home Assistant のオートメーション」等に統一すると読みやすい。  \n\n5. “lil bots that hang out and tell me things”  \n   - 「小さな bot を作って遊ばせています」では“hang out”を落としている。  \n   • 改善: 「暇さえあればそばにいてしゃべってくれる小さな bot を量産しています」。\n\n-----------------------------\nMINOR（こなれ・表記・文法）\n-----------------------------\n1. 「記事は長いですが内容はシンプル」  \n   - 末尾を「ですが、内容はきわめてシンプルです。」で滑らかに。\n\n2. 「退屈なオートメーション」→「退屈きわまりない自動化ルール」等で硬さを解消。\n\n3. 「一式が動くようになったら」→「全体が動くようになったところで」など自然化。\n\n4. コード断片のラベル  \n   - Fast change Automation / Slow change automation を「高速変化オートメーション」「低速変化オートメーション」と注釈を入れると読者に親切。\n\n5. 半角/全角・単位表記  \n   - “約 12 フィート（約 3.6 m）” → “約12フィート（≒3.6 m）” 等で統一。\n\n6. “Hunter S Thompson” の表記  \n   - カタカナ補足を入れると親切（「ハンター・S・トンプソンみたいに」）。\n\n-----------------------------\nSUMMARY / 次訳時の指針\n-----------------------------\n• 画像キャプションは必ず訳す。  \n• 下品さ・皮肉・擬人化など筆者特有の口調を落とさない。  \n• 技術・俗語は日本語化しつつ英語も添えて読者フォロー。  \n• タイトルや節見出しは日本語でも直観的に。  \n• 細部まで対訳し、「どこで・なぜ・どうして」が抜けていないか逐一点検する。\n\nこれらを反映すれば、原文の勢いとユーモアを保ちつつ、自然で読みやすい完訳になります。",
      "――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――\n総評\n訳文は概ね読みやすく、技術的内容も大きく外してはいません。しかし「原文と同じ勢い・毒気・くだけた語感」を十分には再現し切れておらず、罵り語やスラング・皮肉の度合いが弱められています。また、文体が「です／ます」と常体の混在でぶれる、語感が日本語としてやや不自然な箇所が散見されます。以下、重大度ごとに具体的な問題点と改善案を列挙します。  \n――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――\n\n【A. 高重大度：意味の欠落・誤訳】\n1. profanity／強い語調の“薄味化”  \n   ・“fuck off” → 「くだらないことをしては」  \n   ・“fucking everything up” → 「めちゃくちゃにぶっ壊しつつあり」  \n   → 罵倒語をまろやかにし過ぎて、著者のぶっきらぼうな持ち味が減衰。  \n   ●改善案：  \n     「友人の Ivan とダラダラサボりながら面白いモノを作り散らかしている。」  \n     「この LLM 革命はマジであらゆるものをぶっ壊しつつあって～」\n\n2. “Bunch of sensors”  \n   ニュアンスは「雑多にいっぱい突っ込んだ」感。「大量のセンサー」だと小ぎれい。  \n   ●改善案：「ゴチャッと詰め込んだセンサー類」\n\n3. “We had no idea what was coming next...”  \n   → 訳では「このあと、何が起こるかなんて想像もしていませんでした……」。  \n   直訳調でインパクト弱。  \n   ●改善案：「この先に待ち受けているカオスなんて、当時は知るよしもなかった……」\n\n4. “It is a wafer thin line.”  \n   「ウェハースみたいに薄い紙一重」という造語で意味が曖昧。  \n   ●改善案：「本当に紙一重のさじ加減だ。」\n\n【B. 中重大度：トーン・レジスターの不統一】\n1. 文体混在  \n   ・冒頭は「です／ます」、途中から常体。原文は終始カジュアル常体。  \n   ●改善案：常体で統一。「です／ます」を排除しラフな口語に。\n\n2. キャラ立ちする罵倒・皮肉の希薄化  \n   原文は自己卑下＆罵りで笑いを取るスタイル。訳はややお行儀が良い。  \n   ●改善案：  \n     「退屈きわまりない自動化ルール」→「クソ退屈な自動化」  \n     「超ウザいけど魅力的！」など強い口語を積極的に。\n\n3. 「僕」一人称の固定  \n   原文の一人称は I/we でラフ。日本語では「オレ」「俺ら」なども検討可。文体設計を一貫させる。\n\n【C. 表現／自然さの問題】\n1. 不自然・訳語選択  \n   ・「昼間っからくだらないことをしては面白いモノを作り散らかしています」  \n     → 冗長。 「日がなダラダラしつつ、面白ガジェットを量産してる。」  \n   ・「退屈きわまりない自動化ルール」→「死ぬほど退屈な自動化」  \n   ・「最近のお気に入りグラフ」→ 画像はグラフではない。  \n     原文 “my new favorite graph” は冗談。  \n     → 「最近お気に入りの落書き」などユーモアを反映。\n\n2. 直訳臭・機械翻訳っぽい語順  \n   ・「ここに通知例があります」→「こんな通知が飛んできます」  \n   ・「シンプルですよね。」→「チョー単純。」  \n   口語の語順／助詞ズレを調整。\n\n3. 日本語として不自然なカナ表記  \n   “Home Assistant”は一般に「Home Assistant」で良いが、本文で “home assistant send that sends sensor” の重複を訳さず残した箇所あり（「Home Assistant のオートメーションがセンサーの変化を MQTT に流し、収集＆変換させています。」で可）。\n\n【D. 軽微：体裁・用字用語】\n1. 数値単位  \n   12 feet → 3.6 m と書いたが原文の「about 12 feet」のラフさを残すなら「約3.7 m」。  \n2. 半角／全角の統一  \n   “JSON シンギュラリティ”など半角英字＋全角漢字が続く箇所でスペースを挟む。  \n3. 強調記法  \n   Markdown の **～** や _～_ の位置を原文と合わせる。  \n4. “; )” 顔文字  \n   日本語環境では「😉」などに置くか「;)」そのままかを決め、統一する。  \n\n――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――\n修正例（冒頭数行）\n原訳：  \n2019 年、友人の Ivan と僕はシカゴにあるこの [最高のスタジオ]…  \n昼間っからくだらないことをしては面白いモノを作り散らかしています。\n\n改善案：  \n2019年、相棒の Ivan と俺はシカゴの [ぶっ飛んだスタジオ] で仕事を始めた。日がなダラダラサボりつつ、面白ガジェットを量産して遊び倒している。\n\n――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――\nまとめ\n・意味の取りこぼしは少ないが、原文特有の荒々しいユーモアを削ぎ過ぎ。  \n・文体（常体or敬体）と一人称・語調を全編で統一する。  \n・直訳臭を抑え、ラフな語感・罵り語を追加して原文の勢いを復元。  \n・細部の不自然な日本語やカナ表記を調整。  \n\n上記を反映すれば、「英語ネイティブの毒舌ブロガーが最初から日本語で書いたかのような」仕上がりになります。",
      "【致命的（Critical）】\n\n1. 意味の誤変換 / 逆転  \n   • 原文: “It isn’t pretty, and isn’t mostly written by LLM.”  \n     訳文: 「綺麗じゃないし LLM が半分寝言で書いたみたいなモノだけど」  \n     →「ほとんど LLM が書いた」ように読める。原意は「LLM が書いたわけでもない」。  \n     改善案: 「見た目はイマイチだし、しかも大半を LLM に書かせたわけでもない。」\n\n2. 情報の欠落  \n   • “I also started spending a lot more deliberate time in my office with the team.”  \n     「with the team」が丸ごと抜け落ちている。  \n     改善案: 「チームと一緒にオフィスで過ごす時間も意識的に増やした。」\n\n3. ニュアンスのねじれ  \n   • “Most of them had a very ‘personal’ tone” → 「どれもパーソナルで毒舌なトーン」  \n     “personal” を “毒舌” と決めつけて意味拡大。  \n     改善案: 「ほとんどがすごく“個人的”な語り口だった。」\n\n4. 技術語の誤対応  \n   • “velocity” を「変化量」と訳し速度の概念を欠落させている。  \n     改善案: 「変化速度（velocity）」。\n\n【重大（Major）】\n\n1. トーンの過剰脚色  \n   原文も砕けてはいるが、訳は「クソ」「ぶっ壊す」「激雑」など罵語が多く、原文以上に攻撃的。  \n   – “straight forward” → 「古臭い」  \n   – “amazing studio” → 「ぶっ飛んだスタジオ」  \n   ※スラング自体は許容されるが、強度を一段階落とさないと原文より尖りすぎ。\n\n2. 無用の価値判断挿入  \n   – 「ぶっちゃけ眠くなる」「ムカつくだけ」など、原文にない感情語が追加されている。  \n   – 「天上から降ってくる感じ」→原文は “coming from everywhere”。\n\n3. 見出しのローカライズ不足／過剰  \n   – “## BUT WHAT ABOUT ADDING EYEBALLS!” を「## で、目をつけたらどうなる？」  \n     雰囲気は出ているが “BUT” “EYEBALLS” のユーモアが若干薄れる。  \n     案: 「## ところで“目”を付けたらどうなる？」 など英単語を少し残すと原文の奇抜さが伝わる。\n\n【中程度（Medium）】\n\n1. 不自然・機械的な表現  \n   • 「構造はシンプル」→普通は「内容はシンプル」か「筋は単純」。  \n   • 「睡眠パフォ解析」→省略しすぎ、「睡眠パフォーマンス解析」。  \n   • 「電子ペーパーのアンビエントディスプレイ用センサー判断」→意味不明瞭。  \n     案: 「E-Ink アンビエントディスプレイに表示する内容をセンサーで決定」など。\n\n2. 用語表記ゆれ  \n   – “Home Assistant / home assistant” が混在。  \n   – “MQTT/mqtt” も大小混在。  \n   – “Discord/discord” も混在。統一を。\n\n3. カルチャー参照の欠落  \n   • “convenience store door noise” が「『チリン♪』」だけになり、コンビニ比喩が消失。  \n     案: 「ドアが開閉すると（コンビニの自動ドアみたいに）『チリン♪』と鳴く」。\n\n【軽微（Minor）】\n\n1. 句読点・ダッシュ多用  \n   ―― や … の連発で読みづらい。カジュアルさは保ちつつ適度に整理を。  \n\n2. 和製英語・カタカナの多用  \n   「ブン回す」「爆誕」「エグい」などは好き嫌いが分かれる。連発を抑えると読みやすい。\n\n3. キャプション訳漏れ / 意訳  \n   “Boring and not very smart” → 「役には立つけど死ぬほど退屈」  \n   “not very smart” のニュアンス（賢くない）が消えている。  \n   案: 「役には立つけど、賢さゼロで死ぬほど退屈」。\n\n【総合提案】\n\n1. スラングは残しつつ強度を 1 段階下げ、原文の“くだけたが攻撃的すぎない”トーンに合わせる。  \n2. 原文にない価値判断語（古臭い／ムカつく 等）を削除。  \n3. 抜けている語句・ニュアンス（with the team, personal tone など）を補完。  \n4. 技術用語は原文に忠実に訳し、表記を統一。  \n5. 不自然な略語や造語は避け、意味が伝わる日本語に展開。  \n6. キャプション・見出しも含め、原文のユーモアを損なわない程度に訳語を調整。",
      "【最重要度：Critical／致命的な意味逸脱・欠落】\n\n1. 罵り語・過激な語調をほぼ全面的に弱めている  \n   • 原文 “fuck off and build lots of fun stuff” → 「だいたい好き勝手に面白いものを作って遊んでいる」  \n     ‐ “fuck off” の投げやりさ・下品さが消え、原文のキャラクター（粗野で歯に衣着せない語り口）が失われている。  \n     ➜「ダラダラとクソみたいに遊びながら面白いモノを作ってる」など、罵り語を残す方向で補強。  \n   • “LLM revolution is fucking everything up” → 「LLM 革命があらゆるものを揺さぶっていて」  \n     ➜「LLM 革命があらゆるものをぶっ壊しつつあって」など。  \n   ※本文中の F-bomb はすべて穏当表現へ置き換わっている。原文の売りはこの毒っ気なので、致命的なトーン損失。  \n\n2. 「to us」「my friend, and yours」など、読者を巻き込む呼びかけが脱落  \n   • tl;dr 原文 “make my office talk to us” → 訳文では “オフィスが…しゃべるようにした” と “to us” を省略。  \n   • “my friend, and yours: mqtt” の “and yours” が抜けている。  \n     ➜「我らが—and もちろんあなたの—相棒 MQTT」等で補完。  \n\n3. “wafer thin line” の比喩が欠落  \n   • 原文 “It is a wafer thin line.” → 訳文「絶妙なライン」  \n     意味は伝わるが、薄さを示す”wafer thin” のニュアンスが消失。  \n     ➜「紙一重、いやウエハース一枚ほどの薄さのライン」と回収。  \n\n4. “wild card” など説明的語句の省略  \n   • “as a wild card I passed in the last state” → “ワイルドカード” 言及なし。  \n     ➜「おまけ（ワイルドカード）的に last_state も投げている」など追加。  \n\n【高重大度：Tone / Style / Register】\n\n1. ハイテンションな一人称・読者への語りかけが大幅に緩和  \n   • “We had no idea what was coming next...” の三点リーダの余韻は維持しているが、全体的に落ち着いた文体に。  \n   • 原文特有の皮肉・自虐（例 “my sense of job satisfaction”）も淡泊。  \n     ➜ 主語を“僕ら”から“オレら”に、語尾に「w」「ぜ」「な！」を混ぜるなどで温度を上げると原文寄り。  \n\n2. 英語キャプションが原文どおり残置  \n   • “Boring and not very smart” → 「役には立つけど賢さゼロで退屈」→可だが画像キャプションは英語のまま。  \n     原文が英語画像を想定しているので残しても良いが、和訳としては統一した方が読みやすい。  \n\n3. ヘッダー “The json-singularity is here.” を英語のまま  \n   ➜ 「JSON シンギュラリティがやって来た」などに訳しておくと統一感が出る。  \n\n【中重大度：技術用語・一貫性】\n\n1. “sensor(s)” → 「センサー」と「sensor」が混在  \n   ➜ カタカナ「センサー」に統一。  \n\n2. “bot” “LLM” “mqtt” など、全角／半角や大文字小文字が揺れる  \n   • “MQTT” と “mqtt” が混在。  \n   ➜ 技術用語は原綴を大文字で統一（本文で原作者も大文字）。  \n\n3. 「occupied=在室中」などコードの値と説明文が混ざり不自然  \n   ➜ `occupied` (在室中) のように括弧注で示す。  \n\n【中度：日本語としての不自然・文法】\n\n1. 「記事は長いけど筋はシンプル」  \n   ‐ “筋” はやや文学的。ここでは「内容はシンプル」で十分。  \n\n2. 「ためしにフィールドを一つ増やしてみても──」後半のダッシュが読点代わり。  \n   ➜ 「……」または普通の文末に。  \n\n3. 「役には立つけど賢さゼロで退屈」  \n   ‐ “賢さゼロ” はやや直訳臭。  \n   ➜ 「頭はカラッポで正直退屈」など自然に。  \n\n4. 「どちらも『オフィスが occupied=在室中』のときだけ発火する」  \n   ‐ “発火する” は IT 用語として可だが一般読者向けには “実行される” の方が自然。  \n\n【軽微：用語・体裁】\n\n1. 半角スペースと全角スペースの混在（例 “LLM を” の前後など）。  \n2. 「VTuber リグ」→「VTuber のリグ」など助詞抜け箇所複数。  \n3. 括弧内の英語と日本語の間にコンマが欠落して読みにくいところあり。  \n\n【訳文サンプル修正案（抜粋）】\n\n原: “Mostly we just fuck off and build lots of fun stuff.”  \n現訳: 「だいたい好き勝手に面白いものを作って遊んでいる。」  \n改: 「基本オレら、グダグダしながらクソ面白いモノを量産して遊んでるだけ。」\n\n原: “LLM revolution is fucking everything up...”  \n現訳: 「LLM 革命があらゆるものを揺さぶっていて...」  \n改: 「LLM 革命がありとあらゆるものをぶっ壊しつつあって...」\n\n原: “It is a wafer thin line.”  \n現訳: 省略  \n改: 「その差はウエハース一枚分ってくらい紙一重だ。」\n\n【まとめ】\n\n・意味を変えてしまう誤訳は少ないが、原文のクセの強い罵り語・毒舌ユーモアがほぼ削ぎ落とされており、読者が受ける人物像・雰囲気が激変している。  \n・技術用語の表記ゆれと英語ヘッダー／キャプション未訳は統一を。  \n・細部の語感・助詞のゆるさ、コード値の説明方法などに機械翻訳的ぎこちなさが残る。  \n\n上記ポイントを修正すれば、原文の“荒っぽくもハイテンションでテクニカル”な味わいを保ったまま、読みやすい完訳に近づくはずです。"
