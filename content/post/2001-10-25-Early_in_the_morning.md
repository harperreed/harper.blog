So. Today has been great so far. My girlfriend is visiting later, I have a BIG meeting and presentation for work in a couple hours. and to top it all off, while I was reading my favorite new source, I noticed <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/25/1222257&mode=thread&threshold=-1">this</a> article which linked to my <a href="http://www.audreyhacking.com">website</a>.
