So I guess it is time to tell everyone what I really do when I "play" computer. I guess I read a lot of useless information. I would like to direct you to <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com">this</a> site which has all sorts of crazy info, I also check <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">slashdot.org</a> a lot(too much really - where oh where is <a href="http://www.geekizoid.com">geekizoid</a>). Really I just read and take in information. So much information. I know a lot of really useless stuff. Well that is it for today. Peace.
