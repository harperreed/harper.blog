at about 3. I then went to watcht the incredibles with hiromi. it ruled. I liked it a lot. <br/><br/>
then I went to target and got a no region dvd player. it ruled. we then came home and watched zatoichi. soooo good. I am sleepy nwo - however I MUST clean my room. it is a mess for sure. <br/><br/>recently I have been thinking a lot about some decisions I made in the last week - I think I mistreated one of my friends. it is sad. she is upset. as well as i. however I don't think it is reconciable at this point. sometimes learning is difficult - expecially when I am both the bad example and the student. hah. I am dumb.
