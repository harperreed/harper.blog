title: The new new AI tools
---

Back in the 2000s, we were all excited about new rock and roll, electro, and the scene and music coming out of nyc. some friends put together a party called the new new. The party was a great time (well, until I got kicked out for acting a fool lol). Specifically meant to feature all the wild new vibes that were coming down the pike.

It felt magical.

I feel the same way right now when it comes to AI tooling and weird new productivity tools.

For the first time in a decade, I am using regular new tools and apps that have changed how I do work.

## Arc Browser

### Download: [https://arc.net/](https://arc.net/)

Arc Browser kind of drives me crazy. I often use many windows (I have GIANT monitors), and it seems to hate that. I will accidentally close a video chat at least once a week. But even with that weakness, ARC browser is a wonderful tools.

The layout of the tabs (on the side), the spaces/ profiles, and how it all works together - allows me to become a lot more productive.

I can set up my "Work" space, and make sure it has all my work contextual links, apps, etc without commingling them with other contexts. And then when I am not working, I just click over to the cookie clicker space and click cookies.

Related - since I shut down galactic, all I do is click cookies. Soooo many cookies have been clicked.

## Perplexity

### Visit: [https://perplexity.ai/](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

When I first started using perplexity I didn't really get why I would use it instead of google or chatgpt. But recently, I have been using it as my tiny lil research assistant. I will just ask it a general question and have it dig in. From there I will direct it in a few different ways. It's pretty simple and easy to use.

I also like that I can use the web or mobile.

I ended up paying for it - let's see if I continue to use it.

It seems to be a LOT better than the chatgpt browsing / search tool. I have found it works really well for digging into weird shit.

## ChatGPT (obv)

### Visit: [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/)

Unless you have been living under a rock, chatgpt has been all the rage. I use it as my very naive intern. It rules. I literally use it for everything.

Here is a shot unordered list of things I have asked chatgpt in the last couple days:

- How to use this Japanese water heater (uploaded a photo of the shower control panel)
- Build a business plan for a container homes project
- how to adjust hero image sizes using hugo
- Identify this AC unit from a photo
- What high end toaster should I buy a friend who lives in Europe?
- How to make an Onigiri costume
- How to mount a Linux .img file on a mac
- Why airplane turbulence (default example chat from openai)
- Afren and DayQuil interactions

As you can see it's all over the place. Also, I have a cold. I use the SHIT out of chatgpt. It's hilariously overused atm.

An possibly related observation:  I no longer know how to spell things.

## Kagi

{{< image caption="No More Google! Kagi!" src="/images/posts/kagi.png" >}}

### Visit: [https://kagi.com/](https://kagi.com/)

The Kagi search engine is a nice replacement for google.com. This blows my mind. I used to LOVE google. I remember when google launched and I was like "FUCK METACRAWLER. I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER SEARCH ENGINE." and now 25 years later or I am sad to say that I have been using another search engine

I am not happy about it. I just got tired of all the ads (which is kind of the same exact thing I said about metacrawler).

Kagi is very good. It's clean. It finds stuff for me. And it works consistently. I am rarely going to google to double check.

I haven't yet checked out a lot of the advanced Kagi tools (their browser etc). I imagine I will at some point.

## Thoughts

A lot of these tools are "AI driven" or have come up during this AI revolution. I find the addition of LLMs to every one of my tools kind of funny. I am not so worried about leaking my data into the LLM (although, I am careful). I am worried about these tools just turning into one another.

It seems clear that at some point in the future we will use just one "agent" or "searcher" instead of 3.

## Other tools, older and less AI

Here is a quick list of other tools that are in daily use. I highly recommend these.

- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - my editor of choice
- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - my other editor of choice
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) - my network *(I pay for this)*
- [Maestral](https://maestral.app/) - dropbox client that doesn't suck
- [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com/) - I use this daily *(I pay for this)*
- [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) / [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) - feeeedsss
