today is a good day<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><small>
Uday Hussein's house:<br/>
<i>The walls of a gym were plastered with photographs of women downloaded from the Internet - "the biggest collection of naked women I?d ever seen," said US army Captain Ed Ballanco. "It looked like something at the Playboy Mansion." <br/>

<br/>Among the photos were those of Jenna and Barbara Bush, the president?s twin 21-year-old daughters, Ballanco said, adding that soldiers took them down "to protect the president." </i>
