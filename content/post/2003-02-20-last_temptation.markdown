I just finished watching Donnie Darko. It was quite the movie. I enjoyed it. I thought it was humorous that on halloween - they were showing the last temptation of christ - a movie that isn't necessarily halloweenish. It is also funny how similar donnie darko was to this movie. Heh. I smiledwhen they showed clips of evil dead. I really enjoyed the movie. I liked the music and how the sound interacted with the plot. It was insane. I did think it was dumb when frank took off his mask. I mean it did associate frank with humans which was key - but the makeup was kinda bad for a movie whose special effects seemed rather elegant. <br/><br/>apparently donnie darko is about divine intervention.
