translationKey: A video conference setup for pro level video chats
---

For the past 7 or 8 years I have  been traveling around the world speaking at amazing conferences and hanging out with amazing people. It was really great. However, that has all changed due to COVID-19. We now hang out in our houses and chat on zoom, hangouts, etc. It is... ok. But I think it can be better. let me walk you through what i have done. 

Like most of the people reading this, I was stuck in my house doing 200 video chat meetings a day.

I also wrote a bunch of software, hacks, etc.

A number of people have asked about my setup, so I figured I should document it here.  If i was a youtuber this would all be one 10 minute video... hmm.. 

Anyway. 

There are three distinct "parts" to this madness:

* Zoom Room setup
* General high quality streaming setup
* Software
* Misc

Let me walk your through each of them. 

## Zoom Room setup

Back in the fall of 2019 I was able to purchase

startup equip

PTZ hijinx

Covid! 

Moved to our house. It just works. 

Zoom sometimes crashes and sometimes is terrible

Sitting on your couch all the time is not healthy

## Speaking Rig

Req:

* high quality
* nice but not obnoxious dof
* easy
* ALWAYS WORKS
* not reliant on OBS

I started using some cameras we had left
