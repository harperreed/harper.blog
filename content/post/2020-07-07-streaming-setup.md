For the past 7 or 8 years I have  been traveling around the world speaking at amazing conferences and hanging out with amazing people. It was really great. However, that has all changed due to Covid-19. We now hang out in our houses and chat on zoom, hangsouts, etc. It is.. ok. 

I was lucky in that I have been watching covid for awhile and was a bit prepared for the eventuality of all of us pushed to our basements, offices and cubby roomes. I was able to repurpose some older kit to make my zoom life a bit more comfortable. 

I found speaking in my zoom room kind of annoying. It was flat, bad audio and not great picture. I decided to upgrade and make a dedicated "speaking" rig. It is way way better quality. 

I also wrote a bunch of software, hacks, etc.

A number of people have asked about my setup, so I figured I should document it here.  If i was a youtuber this would all be one 10 minute video... hmm.. 

Anyway. 

There are three distinct "parts" to this madness:

* Zoom Room setup
* General high quality streaming setup
* Software
* Misc

Let me go through them

## Zoom Room setup

Back in the fall of 2019 I was able to purchase

startup equip

PTZ hijinx

Covid! 

Moved to our house. It just works. 

Zoom sometimes crashes and sometimes is terrible

Sitting on your couch all the time is not healthy

## Speaking Rig

Req:

* high quality
* nice but not obnoxious dof
* easy
* ALWAYS WORKS
* not reliant on OBS

I started using some cameras we had left
