excerpt: 'yep.


  what is frustrating to me is the people who are all "oh yea see bush is right" and
  all this crap about politics when they just started paying attention it a week ago.
  then they gloat and act like they were right all along. well I just welcome them
  to the world which they have helped create. hopefully they will enjoy it as much
  as I will. mmm, candy'
