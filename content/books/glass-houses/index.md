A group of employees and their CEO, celebrating the sale of their remarkable emotion\-mapping\-AI\-alogorithm, crash onto a not\-quite\-deserted tropical island. Luckily, those who survived have found a beautiful, fully stocked private palace, with all the latest technological updates (though one without connection to the outside world). The house, however, has more secrets than anyone might have guessed, and a much darker reason for having been built and left behind.
