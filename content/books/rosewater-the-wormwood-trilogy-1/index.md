**Tade Thompson’s *Rosewater* is the start of an award-winning, cutting edge trilogy set in Nigeria, by one of science fiction’s most engaging new voices.**  
  
**Rosewater** is a town on the edge. A community formed around the edges of a mysterious alien biodome, its residents comprise the hopeful, the hungry and the helpless – people eager for a glimpse inside the dome or a taste of its rumored healing powers.   
  
**Kaaro** is a government agent with a criminal past. He has seen inside the biodome, and doesn’t care to again — but when something begins killing off others like himself, Kaaro must defy his masters to search for an answer, facing his dark history and coming to a realization about a horrifying future.
