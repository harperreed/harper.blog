"Any Given Tuesday: A Political Love Story" offers a candid and unfiltered peek into the often tumultuous world of American politics, as told by Lis Smith, a former senior adviser on Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign. In this memoir, Smith navigates her journey—starting from her humble beginnings as a wide-eyed intern who slept in her car to becoming a powerhouse strategist trusted by some of the most prominent figures in the Democratic Party.

With a blend of humor and irreverence, Smith recounts her various experiences and controversial choices that sometimes made headlines. She does not shy away from discussing her mistakes and the lessons learned along the way. Readers will be brought into a world not usually seen—what happens beyond the cameras and in the quiet moments of decision-making lived by those in power. Smith expertly describes the hand-to-hand combat of political campaigns and highlights a relentless dedication to positive change.

With an average rating of 4.13 from over 1,300 readers, this memoir is more than a simple recounting of political events; it's an intimate exploration of the flawed nature of humanity existing within the high-stakes environments of political life. Smith's narrative reveals not just her professional evolution but also a very personal reflection on the sacrifices made in the name of political ambition.

In presenting her story, Lis Smith invites us to question the conventions of political memoirs and challenges us to engage with the allure and messiness of a career fueled by passion and a deep-seated desire to affect change.
