<i>Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41709682-exhalation" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></i><br /><br />The universe began as an enormous breath being held.<br /><br />From the acclaimed author of <i>Stories of Your Life and Others</i> — the basis for the Academy Award-nominated film <i>Arrival</i> — comes a ground-breaking new collection of short fiction: nine stunningly original, provocative, and poignant stories. These are tales that tackle some of humanity's oldest questions along with new quandaries only Ted Chiang could imagine.<br /><br />In "<i>The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate</i>", a portal through time forces a fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past mistakes and second chances. In "<i>Exhalation</i>", an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications that are literally universal. In "<i>Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom</i>" the ability to glimpse into alternate universes necessitates a radically new examination of the concepts of choice and free will.<br /><br />Including stories being published for the first time as well as some of his rare and classic uncollected work, <i>Exhalation</i> is Ted Chiang at his best: profound, sympathetic — revelatory.<br /><br />Contents:<br />- <i>The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate</i> (2007)<br />- <i>Exhalation</i> (2008)<br />- <i>What's Expected of Us</i> (2005)<br />- <i>The Lifecycle of Software Objects</i> (2010)<br />- <i>Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny</i> (2011)<br />- <i>The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling</i> (2013)<br />- <i>The Great Silence</i> (2015)<br />- <i>Omphalos</i> (2018)<br />- <i>Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom</i> (2018)<br /><br />
