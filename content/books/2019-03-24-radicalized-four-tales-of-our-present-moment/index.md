<b>Told through one of the most on-pulse genre voices of our generation--<i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Cory Doctorow--<i>Radicalized </i>is a timely novel comprised of four science fiction novellas connected by social, technological, and economic visions of today and what America could be in the near, near future. </b><br /><i></i><br /><i>Unauthorized Bread</i> is a tale of immigration, the toxicity of economic and technological stratification, and the young and downtrodden fighting against all odds to survive and prosper.<br /><br />In <i>Model Minority</i>, a Superman-like figure attempts to rectifiy the corruption of the police forces he long erroneously thought protected the defenseless...only to find his efforts adversely affecting their victims.<br /><br /><i>Radicalized</i> is a story of a darkweb-enforced violent uprising against insurance companies told from the perspective of a man desperate to secure funding for an experimental drug that could cure his wife's terminal cancer.<br /><br />The fourth story, <i>Masque of the Red Death,</i> harkens back to Doctorow's <i>Walkaway</i>, taking on issues of survivalism versus community.<br /><br />At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.
