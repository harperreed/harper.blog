“There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.” <br /> <br />My name is Kvothe. You may have heard of me.<br /> <br />So begins a tale told from his own point of view—a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man’s Fear, Day Two of The Kingkiller Chronicle, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.<br /><br />source: penguinrandomhouse.com
