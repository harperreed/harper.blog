In "Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism," Sarah Wynn-Williams shares her explosive memoir detailing her experiences within Facebook—the social media powerhouse that has significantly shaped political landscapes and personal lives globally. This account is not just a story about technology; it’s a mirror reflecting the complexities of power, ambition, and the stark realities of idealism corroded by corporate culture.

Wynn-Williams invites readers into the rollercoaster journey of navigating one of the most influential companies on the planet. Drawing from her firsthand experiences, she recounts encounters with world leaders, extravagant travel, and disheartening instances of misogyny that permeate the workplace. Her narrative weaves fascinating tales, from the company’s initial missteps in political engagement to pivotal moments that revealed Facebook’s undeniable influence in events like Trump’s election. 

As she shares her struggles with the brutality of corporate life—balancing motherhood with the relentless demands of her career—Wynn-Williams boldly challenges the 'lean in' mantra popularized by Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, exposing how it often ignores the harsh realities for working mothers.

With an average rating of 4.46 garnered from over 3,500 readers, "Careless People" stands out as both a gripping personal tale and a sharp critique of a corporate culture that prioritizes power over responsibility. It’s an unflinching exploration of how unchecked influence can lead to disastrous outcomes for individuals and societies alike, all told in a candid and disarming voice by an author who has been deep within the trenches of this zeitgeist-defining institution.
