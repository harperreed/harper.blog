<b>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book </b><br /><br /><b>One of the Best Books of the Year: <i>Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, Entertainment Weekly, Slate</i></b><br /><br />In <i>A Free Life</i>, Ha Jin follows the Wu family — father Nan, mother Pingping, and son Taotao — as they sever their ties with China in the aftermath of the 1989 massacre at Tiananmen Square and begin a new life in the United States. As Nan takes on a number of menial jobs, eventually operating a restaurant with Pingping, he struggles to adapt to the American way of life and to hold his family together, even as he pines for a woman he loved and lost in his youth. Ha Jin's prodigious talents are in full force as he brilliantly brings to life the struggles and successes of the contemporary immigrant experience.<br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>
