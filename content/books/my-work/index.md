From acclaimed author Olga Ravn, in collaboration with translator Sophia Hersi Smith, 'My Work' is a radical novel that unflinchingly addresses the experience of motherhood in a modern world. Set against the backdrop of a snowy Stockholm, the story delves into the psyche of Anna, a new mother grappling with profound anxiety after childbirth. As she navigates her new role, the weight of responsibility and dread threatens to engulf her.

With an average rating of 4.02 from readers, this 416-page novel incorporates various literary forms—fiction, essay, poetry, memoir, and letters—to present a multifaceted perspective on the intersections of motherhood, labor, and the literary landscape. Ravn's ability to articulate the emotion-rich tapestry of new motherhood—from the joy and laughter to the darker tides of fear and depression—is strikingly powerful, creating a narrative that is both accessible and profound.

The book emphasizes not merely the quotidian aspects of parenting but also challenges the reader to contemplate the deeper meanings of work and individual identity in a transformative life phase. It speaks candidly about the societal expectations placed on mothers, the struggles for personal fulfillment, and the yearning for connection amid the chaos.

Critically acclaimed, with descriptors like 'dazzling' and 'mercilessly honest,' Ravn's writing promises to evoke a spectrum of emotions, making 'My Work' a compelling read for anyone interested in contemporary narratives surrounding parenthood and women's experiences.

Ravn, with her prior work 'The Employees' already acknowledged for its innovative style, continues to push boundaries, while translator Sophia Hersi Smith ensures her voice resonates across linguistic barriers. This book is recommended for those seeking literary explorations of motherhood imbued with humor, tragedy, and raw honesty.
