Published in November 2010 by Mythic Island Press, "The Bohr Maker" is the first book in Linda Nagata's compelling series titled "The Nanotech Succession." Set in a future where humanity's existence is threatened by its own innovations, the narrative follows Nikko, the first true post-human—a genetically engineered individual designed to thrive in the void of space. As time runs out on his research permit, he faces the imminent collapse of his fragile existence due to a pre-programmed failure within his own DNA.

Nikko’s desperate quest for survival leads him to the illegal and potent nanotechnology device known as the Bohr Maker, which has the capability to rewrite his genetic code and extend his life. However, during an attempt to steal the device from Commonwealth police archives, the plan goes horribly wrong, unleashing the Maker into the world where it infects Phousita, a young woman living in a slum where nanotechnology operates outside the bounds of legality.

The Bohr Maker transforms Phousita's genetic structure, enhancing her senses and granting her extraordinary healing abilities, but she becomes ensnared in the same web of trouble as Nikko. Together, they are chased by the Commonwealth police, who are determined to eradicate any trace of the device before its power spreads through the populace. The narrative is a fast-paced thriller that dives deep into ethical debates about humanity and technology. It raises questions about the nature of identity and the potential consequences of our own creations.
