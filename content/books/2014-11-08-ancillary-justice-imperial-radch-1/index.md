(Alternate cover edition of ISBN 031624662X / 9780316246620.) <br /><br />On a remote, icy planet, the soldier known as Breq is drawing closer to completing her quest. <br /><br />Once, she was the Justice of Toren - a colossal starship with an artificial intelligence linking thousands of soldiers in the service of the Radch, the empire that conquered the galaxy. <br /><br />Now, an act of treachery has ripped it all away, leaving her with one fragile human body, unanswered questions, and a burning desire for vengeance.
