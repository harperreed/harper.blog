If there’s one thing Mare Barrow knows, it’s that she’s different.<br /><br />Mare Barrow’s blood is red—the color of common folk—but her Silver ability, the power to control lightning, has turned her into a weapon that the royal court tries to control. <br /><br />The crown calls her an impossibility, a fake, but as she makes her escape from Maven, the prince—the friend—who betrayed her, Mare uncovers something she is not the only one of her kind.<br /><br />Pursued by Maven, now a vindictive king, Mare sets out to find and recruit other Red-and-Silver fighters to join in the struggle against her oppressors. <br /><br />But Mare finds herself on a deadly path, at risk of becoming exactly the kind of monster she is trying to defeat. <br /><br />Will she shatter under the weight of the lives that are the cost of rebellion? Or have treachery and betrayal hardened her forever?<br /><br />The electrifying next installment in the Red Queen series escalates the struggle between the growing rebel army and the blood-segregated world they’ve always known—and pits Mare against the darkness that has grown in her soul.?
