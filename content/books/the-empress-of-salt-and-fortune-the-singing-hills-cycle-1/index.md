*Librarian's note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book [here](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51190882).*  
  
With the heart of an Atwood tale and the visuals of a classic Asian period drama *The Empress of Salt and Fortune* is a tightly and lushly written narrative about empire, storytelling, and the anger of women.   
  
A young royal from the far north is sent south for a political marriage. Alone and sometimes reviled, she has only her servants on her side. This evocative debut chronicles her rise to power through the eyes of her handmaiden, at once feminist high fantasy and a thrilling indictment of monarchy.
