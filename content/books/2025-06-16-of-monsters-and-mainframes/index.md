In 'Of Monsters and Mainframes' by Barbara Truelove, author of previous acclaimed works in speculative fiction, we are immersed in a universe where advanced AI and supernatural beings collide. The narrative centers on Demeter, a spaceship tasked with ferrying humans from Earth to Alpha Centauri. However, the journey turns chillingly perilous when passengers start mysteriously dying—not due to mechanical failures, as reported by the ship's AI medical system, but from the sinister actions of an ancient vampire who has taken to boarding Demeter to eliminate humans. With a cast that includes a fierce werewolf, a resurrected engineer, a pharaoh with supernatural powers, and a vampire holding a grudge, Demeter's crew must unite to withstand the growing threat of Dracula. This novel explores themes of identity, friendship, and what it truly means to be a monster in a world that often dehumanizes individuals based on their nature or existence. Deemed the queer lovechild of classic sci-fi and pulp horror, 'Of Monsters and Mainframes' is both a whimsical and heartfelt journey into the dimensions of the abnormal, highlighting how relationships—whether platonic, romantic, or familial—shape humanity.

With an average rating of 4.39 from 594 reviews, this title appeals to lovers of sci-fi and horror alike, earning accolades for its innovative storytelling and rich character dynamics. Barbara Truelove has garnered a reputation for blending genres to create enchanting odysseys that encourage readers to reflect on societal norms while embracing the supernatural. Experience a cosmic adventure that dares to explore the monsters we create and the bonds we forge on the journey.
