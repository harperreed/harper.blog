THE UNIVERSE IS CALLING—and time is running out.<br /><br />Tina has always known her destiny is outside the norm—after all, she is the human clone of the most brilliant alien commander in all the galaxies (even if the rest of the world is still deciding whether aliens exist). But she is tired of waiting for her life to begin.<br /><br />And then it does—and maybe Tina should have been more prepared. At least she has a crew around her that she can trust—and her best friend at her side. Now, they just have to save the world.<br /><br /><b>From internationally bestselling author Charlie Jane Anders (<i>All the Birds in the Sky</i>) comes a thrilling adventure set against an intergalactic war—Anders’s long-awaited YA debut.</b>
