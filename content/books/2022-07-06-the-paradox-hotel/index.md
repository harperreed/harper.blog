<b>An impossible crime. A detective on the edge of madness. The future of time travel at stake.</b><br /><br />January Cole’s job just got a whole lot harder.<br /><br />Not that running security at the Paradox was ever really easy. Nothing’s simple at a hotel where the ultra-wealthy tourists arrive costumed for a dozen different time periods, all eagerly waiting to catch their “flights” to the past.<br /><br />Or where proximity to the timeport makes the clocks run backward on occasion—and, rumor has it, allows ghosts to stroll the halls.<br /><br />None of that compares to the corpse in room 526. The one that seems to be both there and not there. The one that somehow only January can see.<br /><br />On top of that, some very important new guests have just checked in. Because the U.S. government is about to privatize time-travel technology—and the world’s most powerful people are on hand to stake their claims.<br /><br />January is sure the timing isn’t a coincidence. Neither are those “accidents” that start stalking their bidders.<br /><br />There’s a reason January can glimpse what others can’t. A reason why she’s the only one who can catch a killer who’s operating invisibly and in plain sight, all at once.<br /><br />But her ability is also destroying her grip on reality—and as her past, present, and future collide, she finds herself confronting not just the hotel’s dark secrets but her own.
