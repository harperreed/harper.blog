When a team of American scientists tests new computer hardware by calculating the value of pi into the deep decimals, the figures begin to repeat a pattern where there ought to be none. It’smathematically untenable—unless the physical constants that undergird our universe have altered, ever so slightly…<br /><br />A cascade of missing persons reports, far from being supernatural, threatens to be perfectly natural—a profound disturbance in being itself—and explodes into a mind trip of a crescendo in this tale of quantum horror.
