<b>It is winter in Area X. A new team embarks across the border on a mission to find a member of a previous expedition who may have been left behind.</b><br /><br />As they press deeper into the unknown — navigating new terrain and new challenges — the threat to the outside world becomes more daunting. <br /><br />In <i>Acceptance</i>, the last installment of Jeff VanderMeer’s Southern Reach Trilogy, the mysteries of Area X may have been solved, but their consequences and implications are no less profound — or terrifying.
