**God is dead. Meet the kids.**  
  
Fat Charlie Nancy's normal life ended the moment his father dropped dead on a Florida karaoke stage. Charlie didn't know his dad was a god. And he never knew he had a brother.   
  
Now brother Spider's on his doorstep -- about to make Fat Charlie's life more interesting... and a lot more dangerous.
