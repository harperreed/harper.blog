A breathtaking geopolitical fantasy as fraught as *Game of Thrones*, *The Monster Baru Cormorant* is the long-anticipated sequel to Seth Dickinson gut-wrenching debut, *The Traitor Baru Cormorant*. 

Baru Cormormant's world was shattered by the Empire of Masks. To exact her revenge, she has clawed her way up razor-edged rungs of betrayal, sacrifice, and compromise, becoming the very thing she seeks to destroy.

Now she strides in the Masquerade's halls of power. To save the world, she must tear it asunder...and with it, all that remains of her soul.
