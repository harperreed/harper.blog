<b><i>ISBN 9781250851246</i> from Kindle copyright page.</b><br /><br /><br /><b>J. S. Dewes, author of <i>The Last Watch</i> and <i>The Exiled Fleet</i>, returns with another science fiction space opera, <i>Rubicon</i>, that melds elements of Scalzi's <i>Old Man's War</i> with <i>Edge of Tomorrow</i>.</b><br /><br />Sergeant Adriene Valero wants to die.<br /><br />She can't.<br /><br />After enduring a traumatic resurrection for the ninety-sixth time, Valero is reassigned to a special forces unit and outfitted with a cutting-edge virtual intelligence aid. They could turn the tide in the war against intelligent machines dedicated to the assimilation, or destruction, of humanity.<br /><br />When her VI suddenly achieves sentience, Valero is drawn into the machinations of an enigmatic major who’s hell-bent on ending the war — by any means necessary.
