“Twenty-four years ago, we began our work together, drawing back the veil of ignorance that conceals the world’s cruelties. We hoped to inspire our audience to become less cruel, less harmful. This is not what has happened."   
  
Su lit a fire.   
Rayen taught her friends how to kill.   
Julia's ex started an epidemic.   
But the Crosses are greater than the sum of their parts.   
  
Among the jaded youth, a new ideology is gaining popularity, one that poses a threat to all humanity.   
  
The revolution will be global, panlingual, and single-mindedly merciless.
