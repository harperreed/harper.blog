At any given moment, 5% of the Internet is hidden from view - that's the Dark Net. It's a haven for criminals, spies, and nefarious hackers. For Max Caine it's also a death trap, where reality and the virtual world collide. Join Max and Betty3.5, and their virtual penguin Linus, as they explore the darkest recesses of the Internet. This cyber thriller will take you on a wild ride into the not-too-distant future where conveniences from auto-piloted cars to wearable computers and biometric ATMs ensure that everyone is online, one way or another, every waking moment. But continual connection has a price. As Max discovers in his journeys through the Dark Net -- you can log out any time you want, but you can never leave.
