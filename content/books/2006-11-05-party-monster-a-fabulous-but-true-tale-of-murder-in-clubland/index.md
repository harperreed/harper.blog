<b></b>Murder Was Never So Much Fun! <p> When Disco Bloodbath was first published, it created a storm of controversy for its startlingly vivid, strikingly fresh, and outrageously funny depiction of the hedonistic world of the New York City club kids, for whom nothing was too outr√© -- including murder. Nominated for the Edgar Award for best true-crime book of the year, it also marked the debut of an audaciously talented writer, James St. James, who himself had been a club kid and close friend and confidant of Michael Alig, the young man convicted of killing the drug dealer known as Angel. </p><p> Now the book has been brought to the screen as <i>Party Monster,</i> with Macaulay Culkin playing killer Michael Alig and Seth Green as author/celebutante James St. James.</p>
