In the haunting landscape of a near-future northern settlement, the novel "Camp Zero" by Michelle Min Sterling presents a chilling yet mesmerizing exploration of survival and identity amidst an unraveling climate. Set against the backdrop of an American building project named Camp Zero, the narrative intertwines the lives of its characters, including Rose, a desperate daughter of a climate-displaced Korean immigrant, and Grant, a college professor looking to escape his opulent but dark family legacy.

Each character's motives intertwine with eerie rumors of a hidden clan of women soldiers at a nearby Cold War-era climate research station, sparking a deeper investigation into their true purpose. What unfolds is not only a quest for survival in a warming world but also a reflective commentary on the intersections of gender, class, and migration.
