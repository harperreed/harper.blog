Set in a near-future northern settlement known as Camp Zero, Michelle Min Sterling's compelling novel delves into the lives of climate change survivors whose fates become intertwined in unexpected ways. Rose, a determined daughter helping her climate-displaced Korean immigrant mother, takes on a risky mission to spy on the camp's enigmatic architect. Her journey coincides with that of Grant, a college professor escaping the dark legacy of his privileged upbringing. Together, they uncover more than just the architect's secrets, as whispers of an elite group of women soldiers emerge from a nearby Cold War-era climate research station. The narrative intricately weaves themes of gender, class, and migration, raising urgent questions about who and what will endure in an ever-warming world. With its thought-provoking plot and rich character development, 'Camp Zero' evokes a similar resonance to works like 'Station Eleven' and 'The Power'. Sterling, a notable voice in contemporary literature, crafts a vibrant tapestry that challenges readers to reflect on humanity's resilience in the face of climate crisis. With an average rating of 3.21 from over 19226 readers, this 320-page debut published by Atria Books on April 4, 2023, promises a captivating exploration of survival and identity.
