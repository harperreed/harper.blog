<b><i>To Sleep in a Sea of Stars</i> is a brand new epic novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author of <i>Eragon</i>, Christopher Paolini.</b><br /><br /><b>Kira Navárez dreamed of life on new worlds.<br /><br />Now she's awakened a nightmare.</b><br /><br />During a routine survey mission on an uncolonized planet, Kira finds an alien relic. At first she's delighted, but elation turns to terror when the ancient dust around her begins to move.<br /><br />As war erupts among the stars, Kira is launched into a galaxy-spanning odyssey of discovery and transformation. First contact isn't at all what she imagined, and events push her to the very limits of what it means to be human.<br /><br />While Kira faces her own horrors, Earth and its colonies stand upon the brink of annihilation. Now, Kira might be humanity's greatest and final hope . . .
