Set in a future where America is recovering from a second civil war, the narrative follows defense lawyer Donny Kimoe as he attempts to uphold justice and navigate treacherous political waters.

As the ruling regime has fallen and the previous dictator remains missing, Kimoe finds himself embroiled in two entwined cases that have massive implications for the country's stability. The rebels he once defended are attempting to establish their own utopia in the dilapidated wreckage of New Orleans, where they are enacting their justice by holding powerful figures accountable through trials. Complicating matters, an old colleague reaches out to Kimoe to defend the kidnapped daughter of an adversary, forcing him to weigh loyalty against legality in a volatile environment.
