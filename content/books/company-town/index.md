Meet Hwa. One of the few in her community to forego bio-engineered enhancements, she’s the last truly organic person left on the rig. But she’s an expert in the arts of self-defence, and she’s been charged with training the Family’s youngest, who has been receiving death threats – seemingly from another timeline.   
  
Meanwhile, a series of interconnected murders threatens the city’s stability – serial killer? Or something much, much worse...?
