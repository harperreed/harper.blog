In Ascension by Martin MacInnes is an extraordinary novel that weaves together the intricate threads of cosmology and personal identity. The story follows Leigh, a young microbiologist who has always found solace by the waterfront in Rotterdam. Throughout her life, the undersea world has captivated her imagination, leading her to a career dedicated to marine biology and the study of ancient organisms. 

When a mysterious trench is discovered in the Atlantic, Leigh seizes the opportunity to join a team of explorers, motivated by a desire to uncover evidence of the earth's first life forms. However, what she discovers challenges not only her scientific understanding but also her perception of human origins and existence. As her journey unfolds, it takes her from the depths of the ocean to the Mojave Desert, where she becomes involved with an ambitious space agency exploring phenomena that connect various locations around the globe — each hinting at a pattern beyond comprehension.

Leigh is faced with an emotional dilemma: to continue her groundbreaking work or to remain with her family, particularly her ailing mother and younger sister. This tension amplifies the novel’s poignant exploration of family connections and the sacrifices we make in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.

In Ascension is not only a deeply inquisitive epic that addresses humanity's greatest questions but also a meditation on our innate longing to return to the familiar—those we love and the places that define our home. With a rating of 3.74 from over 15,099 readers on Goodreads, it is evident that MacInnes has created a resonant reflection on both the natural world and the human condition. Drawing on his skillful prose, the novel invites us to confront our own connections to the universe and our shared origins.
