Set against a backdrop of interstellar tension, *The Caledonian Gambit* by Dan Moren invites readers into a galaxy divided between the Illyrican Empire and the Commonwealth. The story follows Simon Kovalic, an elite spy for the Commonwealth, and Kyle Rankin, a seemingly inconsequential soldier cleaning toilets on the remote planet Sabea. Things, however, are not as they appear. Kyle is a facade; his true identity is Eli Brody, a fugitive with roots in the turbulent world of Caledonia—a past that Kovalic recognizes as critical to averting disaster.
