THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD ENDS... FOR THE LAST TIME.<br /><br />The Moon will soon return. Whether this heralds the destruction of humankind or something worse will depend on two women.<br /><br />Essun has inherited the power of Alabaster Tenring. With it, she hopes to find her daughter Nassun and forge a world in which every orogene child can grow up safe.<br /><br />For Nassun, her mother's mastery of the Obelisk Gate comes too late. She has seen the evil of the world, and accepted what her mother will not admit: that sometimes what is corrupt cannot be cleansed, only destroyed.<br /><br /><b>The remarkable conclusion to the post-apocalyptic and highly acclaimed trilogy that began with the multi-award-nominated <i>The Fifth Season.</i></b>
