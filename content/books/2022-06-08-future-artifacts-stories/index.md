Brutal. Devastating. Dangerous.<br /><br />Join an investigation into a cruel and heartless leader … crawl through filth and mud to escape biological warfare … team up with time-traveling soldiers faced with potentially life-altering instructions.<br /><br />Kameron Hurley, award-winning author and expert in the future of war and resistance movements, has created eighteen exhilarating tales giving glimpses into the warfare of tomorrow.<br /><br />A bleak future, yet there is hope for us. With Hurley’s characteristic grim optimism, her characters fight for what they believe is right. They exhibit degrees of humanity only possible in the worst of circumstances. It is these characters, driven by a murky sense of honor and written with sincere, deep empathy, that make Future Artifacts: Stories a powerful collection you won’t soon forget.<br /><br />Contains the following stories:<br />Sky Boys<br />Overdark<br />The Judgement of Gods and Monsters<br />Broker of Souls<br />The One We Feed<br />Corpse Soldier<br />Levianthan<br />Unblooded<br />The Skulls of Our Fathers<br />Body Politic<br />We Burn<br />Antibodies<br />The Traiter Lords<br />Wonder Maul Doll<br />Our Prisoners, the Stars<br />The Body Remembers<br />Moontide<br />Citizens of Elsewhen
