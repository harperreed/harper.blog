<strong>A darkly comic sequel to <em>Tokyo Vice</em> that is equal parts history lesson, true-crime exposé, and memoir.</strong><br /><br />It’s 2008, and it’s been a while since Jake Adelstein was the only <em>gaijin</em> crime reporter for the <em>Yomiuri Shimbun</em>. The global economy is in shambles, Jake is off the police beat but still chain-smoking clove cigarettes, and Tadamasa Goto, the most powerful boss in the Japanese organised crime world, has been banished from the yakuza, giving Adelstein one less enemy to worry about — for the time being. But as he puts his life back together, he discovers that he may be no match for his greatest enemy — himself.<br /><br />And Adelstein has a different gig these due diligence work, or using his investigative skills to dig up information on entities whose bosses would prefer that some things stay hidden.<br /><br />The underworld isn’t what it used to be. Underneath layers of paperwork, corporations are thinly veiled fronts for the yakuza. Pachinko parlours are a hidden battleground between disenfranchised Korean Japanese and North Korean extortion plots. TEPCO, the electric power corporation keeping the lights on for all of Tokyo, scrambles to hide its willful oversights that ultimately led to the 2011 Fukushima meltdown. And the Japanese government shows levels of corruption that make the yakuza look like philanthropists in comparison. All this is punctuated by personal tragedies no one could have seen coming.<br /><br />In this ambitious and riveting work, Jake Adelstein explores what it’s like when you’re in too deep to distinguish the story you chase from the life you live.
