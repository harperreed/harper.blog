*Jesus' Son*, the first collection of stories by Denis Johnson, presents a unique, hallucinatory vision of contemporary American life unmatched in power and immediacy and marks a new level of achievement for this acclaimed writer. In their intensity of perception, their neon-lit evocation of a strange world brought uncomfortably close to our own, the stories in *Jesus' Son* offer a disturbing yet eerily beautiful portrayal of American loneliness and hope.
