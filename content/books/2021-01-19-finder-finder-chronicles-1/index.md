<b>From Hugo Award-winning debut author Suzanne Palmer comes an action-packed sci-fi caper starring Fergus Ferguson, interstellar repo man and professional finder.</b><br /><br />Fergus Ferguson has been called a lot of names: thief, con artist, repo man. He prefers the term <i>finder</i>.<br /><br />His latest job should be simple. Find the spacecraft <i>Venetia's Sword</i> and steal it back from Arum Gilger, ex-nobleman turned power-hungry trade boss. He'll slip in, decode the ship's compromised AI security, and get out of town, <i>Sword</i> in hand.<br /><br />Fergus locates both Gilger and the ship in the farthest corner of human-inhabited space, a gas-giant-harvesting colony called Cernee. But Fergus' arrival at the colony is anything but simple. A cable car explosion launches Cernee into civil war, and Fergus must ally with Gilger's enemies to navigate a field of space mines and a small army of hostile mercenaries. What was supposed to be a routine job evolves into negotiating a power struggle between factions. Even worse, Fergus has become increasingly--and inconveniently--invested in the lives of the locals.<br /><br />It doesn't help that a dangerous alien species thought mythical prove unsettlingly real, and their ominous triangle ships keep following Fergus around.<br /><br />Foolhardy. Eccentric. Reckless. Whatever he's called, Fergus will need all the help he can get to take back the <i>Sword </i>and maybe save Cernee from destruction in the process.
