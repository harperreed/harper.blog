Jess has been sent to be his family’s spy, but his loyalties are tested in the final months of his training to enter the Library’s service.<br /> <br />When his friend inadvertently commits heresy by creating a device that could change the world, Jess discovers that those who control the Great Library believe knowledge is more valuable than any human life—and soon both heretics and books will burn....
