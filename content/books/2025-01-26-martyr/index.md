In *Martyr!*, Kaveh Akbar unveils a narrative that delves deep into the human condition, exploring the themes of meaning, loss, and identity through the eyes of Cyrus Shams—a newly sober, orphaned son of Iranian immigrants. After the tragic death of his mother, whose plane was shot down over Tehran, and his father’s mundane life in America, Cyrus's path spirals into addiction and aimlessness, yet his despair fuels his search for understanding. The sparks of creativity and guidance from poets, artists, and historical figures illuminate his journey.

Cyrus's fascination with martyrs leads him down a winding road of familial mysteries, including an uncle who influenced soldiers during the war by embodying the Angel of Death. It’s through his art and the sudden discovery of a painting that alludes to his mother's hidden past in a Brooklyn art gallery that he begins to unravel the layers of his identity.
