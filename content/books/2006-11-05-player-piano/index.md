Kurt Vonnegut’s first novel spins the chilling tale of engineer Paul Proteus, who must find a way to live in a world dominated by a supercomputer and run completely by machines. Paul’s rebellion is vintage Vonnegut—wildly funny, deadly serious, and terrifyingly close to reality.<br /><br /><i>Alternate cover edition <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25848915-player-piano" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></i>
