<p>It was 1989 when Robert Llewellyn first had his head encased in the one-piece latex foam-rubber balaclava that is the head of Kryten in <i>Red Dwarf</i> series three, and it gave him a distinctly funny turn.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><p><br />Gazing at his own reflection and seeing the face of a mechanoid robot staring back was surprisingly scary, not to mention uncomfortable and rather sweaty. And he couldn't even eat his lunch.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><p><br />Since then, he has sweated, frozen, been set on fire, exploded, spent thousands of hours in the make-up chair and thousands more being taunted by Craig Charles for being a middle-class b*****d. So it is a testament to the joyful camaraderie and life-enhancing silliness of the world of <i>Red Dwarf</i> that twenty-three years later, Robert is still willing to risk life, limb and hairline to don the rubber torture helmet for <i>Red Dwarf X</i>, the recent triumphant return of the motley band of space bums.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><p><br />Originally published in 1993 after series six, <i>The Man in the Rubber Mask</i> has now been completely updated with 43.7% extra smeg.</p>
