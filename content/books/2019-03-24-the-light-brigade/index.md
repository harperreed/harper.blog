<b>NAMED BY <i>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</i> AS A BEST BOOK OF 2019</b><br /> <br /><b>From the Hugo Award­­–winning author of <i>The Stars Are Legion </i>comes a brand-new science fiction thriller about a futuristic war during which soldiers are broken down into light in order to get them to the front lines on Mars.</b><br /><br /><i>They said the war would turn us into light. </i><br /> <i>I wanted to be counted among the heroes who gave us this better world. </i><br /> <br />The Light it’s what soldiers fighting the war against Mars call the ones who come back…different. Grunts in the corporate corps get busted down into light to travel to and from interplanetary battlefronts. Everyone is changed by what the corps must do in order to break them down into light. Those who survive learn to stick to the mission brief—no matter what actually happens during combat.<br /> <br />Dietz, a fresh recruit in the infantry, begins to experience combat drops that don’t sync up with the platoon’s. And Dietz’s bad drops tell a story of the war that’s not at all what the corporate brass want the soldiers to think is going on.<br /> <br />Is Dietz really experiencing the war differently, or is it combat madness? Trying to untangle memory from mission brief and survive with sanity intact, Dietz is ready to become a hero—or maybe a villain; in war it’s hard to tell the difference.<br /> <br />A worthy successor to classic stories like <i>Downbelow Station</i>, <i>Starship Troopers</i>, and<i> The Forever War</i>,<i> The Light Brigade</i> is award-winning author Kameron Hurley’s gritty time-bending take on the future of war.
