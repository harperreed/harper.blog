<b>#1 <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling phenomenon Patrick Rothfuss returns to the wildly popular Kingkiller Chronicle universe with a stunning reimagining of "The Lightning Tree." Expanded to twice its previous length and lavishly illustrated by Nathan Taylor, this touching stand-alone story is sure to please new readers and veteran Rothfuss fans alike.</b><br /><br />Bast knows how to bargain. The give-and-take of a negotiation is as familiar to him as the in-and-out of breathing; to watch him trade is to watch an artist at work. But even a master's brush can slip. When he accepts a gift, taking something for nothing, Bast's whole world is knocked askew, for he knows how to bargainâ€”but not how to owe. <br /><br />From dawn to midnight over the course of a single day, follow the Kingkiller Chronicle's most charming fae as he schemes and sneaks, dancing into trouble and back out again with uncanny grace.<br /><br /><i>The Narrow Road Between Desires</i> is Bast's story. In it he traces the old ways of making and breaking, following his heart even when doing so goes against his better judgement.<br /><br />After all, what good is caution if it keeps him from danger and delight?
