No one can communicate with it, no one can destroy it, and Fleet Captain Nine Hibiscus is running out of options. <br /><br />In a desperate attempt at diplomacy with the mysterious invaders, the fleet captain has sent for a diplomatic envoy. Now Mahit Dzmare and Three Seagrass—still reeling from the recent upheaval in the Empire—face the impossible task of trying to communicate with a hostile entity. <br /><br />Their failure will guarantee millions of deaths in an endless war. Their success might prevent Teixcalaan’s destruction—and allow the empire to continue its rapacious expansion. <br /><br />Or it might create something far stranger . . .<br />
