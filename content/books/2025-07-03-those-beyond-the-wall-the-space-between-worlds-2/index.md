In "Those Beyond the Wall (The Space Between Worlds #2)" by Micaiah Johnson, readers are thrust into a gripping narrative that explores the intersection of violence and the unseen forces that shape our lives. Set in a dystopian landscape, the novel follows Scales, a skilled enforcer maintaining law and order in the desolate desert town of Ashtown. Her sense of duty is tested when a gruesome murder occurs right under her watchâ€”one that defies logic as no visible perpetrator emerges. 

As more mutilated bodies surface in both Ashtown and the affluent, fortified Wiley City, Scales is compelled to investigate. Her relentless pursuit of truth leads her to team up with a no-nonsense partner and a brilliant yet brusque scientist. What begins as a search for a hidden killer morphs into a deeper exploration of systemic corruption that could spell doom for their world.

Micaiah Johnson, a Compton Crook Award-winning author, crafts a searing thriller steeped in profound themes of identity, survival, and social inequality. Her adept storytelling is complemented by a world where the stakes are high, and the lines between ally and enemy blur. With an average rating of 4.06 and over 2,600 ratings, this book is a sequel that stands strongly on its own, inviting readers to delve into its pages and uncover the mysteries that lie beyond the wall. Johnson's earlier work, *The Space Between Worlds*, received critical acclaim, and she continues to impress with her ability to weave complex characters into compelling narratives.
