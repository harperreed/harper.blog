**Silver (Inverted Frontier, #2)**, the thrilling sequel in Linda Nagata's acclaimed series, presents an intricate tapestry of science fiction blended with profound themes of power and desperation. Urban, once the master of the feared starship *Dragon*, finds himself ousted by Lezuri, a god-like entity whose fractured existence becomes both a catalyst and a threat. 

With the stakes high and time running out, Urban embarks on a treacherous journey to a mysterious ring-shaped world—a relic of Lezuri's former glory where forgotten technologies await rediscovery. Yet, the path is fraught with peril as he encounters a surreal and deadly phenomenon: a flood of luminous 'silver' that engulfs the land in an otherworldly fog, reshaping everything it touches, both literally and metaphorically.

Nagata’s narrative probes deep into themes of conflict, identity, and the desperate struggle for knowledge amidst chaos. The gripping prose and inventive world-building showcase her expertise in creating immersive settings that captivate and challenge the reader's perception of reality. With an average rating of 4.19 based on nearly 1000 ratings and a strong community presence, the book promises a rewarding experience for any fan of speculative fiction.

Readers can expect not just an engaging plot, but also a thought-provoking exploration of technology and its implications on human and godly existence. Dive into the chaotic elegance of *Silver*, and join Urban in his fight against the remnants of a broken divinity.
