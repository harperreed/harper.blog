<b>Robin Sloan expands the Penumbraverse to new reaches of time and space in a rollicking far-future adventure.</b><br /><br />In <i>Moonbound</i>, Robin Sloan has written a novel with the full scope and ambitious imagination of the very books that lit the engines of <i>Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore</i>: an epic quest as only Sloan could conceive it, mixing science fiction, fantasy, good old-fashioned literary storytelling, and unrivaled enthusiasm for what’s next.<br /><br />It is thirteen thousand years from now . . . A lot has happened, and yet a lot is still very familiar. Ariel is a boy in a small town under a wizard’s rule. Like many adventurers before him, Ariel is called to explore a world full of unimaginable glories and unknown enemies, a mission to save the world, a girl. Here, as they say, be dragons. But none of this happens before Ariel comes across an artifact from an earlier civilization, a sentient, record-keeping artificial intelligence that carries with it the perspective of the whole of human history―and becomes both Ariel’s greatest ally and the narrator of our story.<br /><br /><i>Moonbound</i> is an adventure into the richest depths of Story itself. It is a deeply satisfying epic of ancient scale, blasted through the imaginative prism one of our most forward-thinking writers. And this is only the beginning.
