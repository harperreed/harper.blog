January 1977. While the chief of the CIA's Moscow station fills his gas tank, a stranger drops a note into the car.<br /><br />In the years that follow, that stranger, Adolf Tolkachev. becomes one of the West's most valuable spies. At enormous risk, Tolachev and his handlers conduct clandestine meetings across Moscow, using spy cameras, disguises, and secret codes to elude the KGB in its own backyard - until a shocking betrayal puts them all at risk.<br /><br />Drawing on previously classified CIA documents and interviews with first-hand participants, 'The Billion Dollar Spy is a brilliant feat of reporting and a riveting true story from the final years of the Cold War.<br /><br />"Non-fiction as rich and resonant as a spy novel by John Le Carre or Graham Greene." - Mail on Sunday<br /><br />"An astonishingly detailed picture of espionage in the 1980s, written with pacey journalistic verve and an early contemporary feel."<br /> - Brian Macintyre, The Times
