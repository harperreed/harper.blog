The first volume in the science fiction epic Tales of the Continuing Time, Emerald Eyes is set in 2062 and introduces favorite series character Trent the Thief. The brutal Unification War has united earth. In Occupied America, the gene-engineered Castanaveras telepaths have just won a hard-fought freedom. But not everyone agrees with the ruling â€“ least of all, cyborg Peaceforcer Elite Mohammed Vance.
