With a new Afterword by the author for the 25th Anniversary edition.  
"Touching as well as hilariously lewd.... Roth is vibrantly talented...as marvelous a mimic and fantasist as has been produced by the most verbal group in human history."  
--Alfred Kazin, "New York Review of Books"   
"Deliciously funny...absurd and exuberant, wild and uproarious... a brilliantly vivid reading experience."-- "New York Times Book Review"
