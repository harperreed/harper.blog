Although Colin Laney (from Gibson's earlier novel <i>Idoru</i>) lives in a cardboard box, he has the power to change the world. Thanks to an experimental drug that he received during his youth, Colin can see "nodal points" in the vast streams of data that make up the worldwide computer network. Nodal points are rare but significant events in history that forever change society, even though they might not be recognizable as such when they occur. Colin isn't quite sure what's going to happen when society reaches this latest nodal point, but he knows it's going to be big. And he knows it's going to occur on the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, which has been home to a sort of SoHo-esque shantytown since an earthquake rendered it structurally unsound to carry traffic.<br /><br />Although <i>All Tomorrow's Parties</i> includes characters from two of Gibson's earlier novels, it's not a direct sequel to either. It's a stand-alone book.<i>--Craig E. Engler</i>
