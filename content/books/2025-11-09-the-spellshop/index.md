In "The Spellshop," Sarah Beth Durst introduces us to Kiela, a reclusive librarian at the Great Library of Alyssium. With a deep-seated inability to connect with people, Kiela has found solace among the kingdom's treasured spellbooks with her magical assistant, Caz, a sentient spider plant. for over a decade, their quiet existence is disrupted when a revolution erupts, leading to the destruction of their sanctuary.

With flames licking at the library's walls, Kiela and Caz make a daring escape to Kiela’s troubled childhood home on a distant island—a place she hoped to never return to. It’s a home now shrouded in neglect and despair, reflecting the empire's failure to care for its people, who rely on magic for survival and protection. Torn between hiding from consequences and confronting her felt responsibility for the chaos, Kiela resolves to transform her sanctuary into a secret spellshop, the first of its kind on the island.

However, sharing her knowledge of magic with the very populace deemed unworthy by the empire carries a severe sentence—death. As she navigates the complexities of reopening a world that has been shut off, Kiela begins to connect with the quirky townspeople, develop unexpected friendships, and uncover the layers of her own heart that she has kept tightly locked away.
