**Everyone's favorite lethal SecUnit is back in the next installment in Martha Wells's *New York Times* bestselling *Murderbot Diaries* series.**  
  
*Am I making it worse? I think I'm making it worse.*  
  
Everyone's favorite lethal SecUnit is back.  
  
Following the events in *Network Effect*, the Barish-Estranza corporation has sent rescue ships to a newly-colonized planet in peril, as well as additional SecUnits. But if there’s an ethical corporation out there, Murderbot has yet to find it, and if Barish-Estranza can’t have the planet, they’re sure as hell not leaving without *something*. If that something just happens to be an entire colony of humans, well, a free workforce is a decent runner-up prize.  
  
But there’s something wrong with Murderbot; it isn’t running within normal operational parameters. ART’s crew and the humans from Preservation are doing everything they can to protect the colonists, but with Barish-Estranza’s SecUnit-heavy persuasion teams, they’re going to have to hope Murderbot figures out what’s wrong with itself, and fast!  
  
*Yeah, this plan is... not going to work.*
