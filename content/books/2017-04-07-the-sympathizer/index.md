The winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, as well as five other awards, <i>The Sympathizer</i> is the breakthrough novel of the year. With the pace and suspense of a thriller and prose that has been compared to Graham Greene and Saul Bellow, <i>The Sympathizer</i> is a sweeping epic of love and betrayal. The narrator, a communist double agent, is a “man of two minds,” a half-French, half-Vietnamese army captain who arranges to come to America after the Fall of Saigon, and while building a new life with other Vietnamese refugees in Los Angeles is secretly reporting back to his communist superiors in Vietnam. <i>The Sympathizer</i> is a blistering exploration of identity and America, a gripping espionage novel, and a powerful story of love and friendship.
