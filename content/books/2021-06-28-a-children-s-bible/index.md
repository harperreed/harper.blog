  <strong>Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2020 by Apple Books, <em>Literary Hub</em>, <em>The Millions</em>, and <em>The Week</em><br /><br /><br /><br />An indelible novel of teenage alienation and adult complacency in an unraveling world.</strong>
</p><br /><p>Pulitzer Prize finalist Lydia Millet’s sublime new novel—her first since the National Book Award long-listed <em>Sweet Lamb of Heaven</em>—follows a group of twelve eerily mature children on a forced vacation with their families at a sprawling lakeside mansion.</p><br /><p>Contemptuous of their parents, who pass their days in a stupor of liquor, drugs, and sex, the children feel neglected and suffocated at the same time. When a destructive storm descends on the summer estate, the group’s ringleaders—including Eve, who narrates the story—decide to run away, leading the younger ones on a dangerous foray into the apocalyptic chaos outside.</p><br /><p>As the scenes of devastation begin to mimic events in the dog-eared picture Bible carried around by her beloved little brother, Eve devotes herself to keeping him safe from harm.</p><br /><p><em>A Children’s Bible</em> is a prophetic, heartbreaking story of generational divide—and a haunting vision of what awaits us on the far side of Revelation.</p>
