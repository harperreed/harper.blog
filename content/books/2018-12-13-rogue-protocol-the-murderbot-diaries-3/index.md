<i>Who knew being a heartless killing machine would present so many moral dilemmas?</i><br /><br />Sci-fiâ€™s favorite antisocial A.I. is back on a mission. The case against the too-big-to-fail GrayCris Corporation is floundering, and more importantly, authorities are beginning to ask more questions about where Dr. Mensah's SecUnit is.<br /><br />And Murderbot would rather those questions went away. For good.
