<b>An audacious marvel of a novel about baseball and a future America, from the always inventive and exciting author of <i>The Love Wife</i> and <i>Who's Irish</i></b><br /><br />The a not-so-distant future. The AutoAmerica. The half under water. The Internet--the new face of government--is "Aunt Nettie": a mix of artificial intelligence, surveillance technology, and pesky maxims. The people have been divided, and no one is happy. The angel-fair "Netted" still have jobs and literally occupy the high ground, while the mostly coppertoned "Surplus" live on swampland if they're lucky, on the water if they're not. <br /> The To a Surplus couple--he <i>was</i> a professor, she's still a lawyer--is born a Blasian girl with a golden arm. At two, Gwen is hurling her stuffed animals from the crib; by ten she can hit whatever target she likes with a baseball; her teens find her playing happily in an underground Surplus league. When AutoAmerica re-enters the Olympics--with a special eye on beating ChinRussia--Gwen attracts interest. Soon she's at Net U, falling in love with her coach and considering "crossing over," even as her mother is challenging the AutoAmerican Way with lawsuits that will prove very dangerous.<br /> An astonishing story of an America that seems only too possible, and of a family struggling to maintain its humanity in circumstances that threaten their every value--even their very existence.
