On Vicious Worlds is the exhilarating sequel in Bethany Jacobs' Kindom Trilogy, following the explosive debut These Burning Stars. With an average rating of 4.50 based on 24 reviews, the narrative unfolds in the backdrop of the distant planet Capamame, where the Jeveni have finally achieved freedom from their oppressors, the Kindom. Under the guidance of leaders like the stoic Cleric Chono, the adventurous caster Jun Ironway, and the enigmatic trickster Six, they navigate the precarious landscape of rebellion and alliances.

Yet as Six and Chono return to the Treble star systems, they quickly learn that freedom comes at a price. The power-hungry Secretaries of the Kindom are mobilizing to reclaim their dominion, setting the stage for a deadly power struggle. Meanwhile, Jun Ironway and the Jeveni collector Masar Hawks brace themselves to shield Capamame from an escalating tide of hostility, exacerbated further by a shadowy saboteur sowing discord.

As old conflicts ignite amidst burgeoning loyalties, the two factions find themselves on a collision course towards a fateful reunion that could spark a revolution. However, the legacy of Esek Nightfoot looms largeâ€”his past actions may hold dire consequences for their fight for survival.

Bethany Jacobs weaves a compelling tale of galactic conflict that resonates with themes of freedom, identity, and the scars left by betrayal. Readers will be drawn into this richly constructed universe, where every character grapples with their motives and the repercussions of their choices.
