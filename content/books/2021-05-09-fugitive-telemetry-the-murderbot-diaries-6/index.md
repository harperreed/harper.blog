<i>No, I didn't kill the dead human. If I had, I wouldn't dump the body in the station mall.</i><br /><br />When Murderbot discovers a dead body on Preservation Station, it knows it is going to have to assist station security to determine who the body is (was), how they were killed (that should be relatively straightforward, at least), and why (because apparently that matters to a lot of people-who knew?)<br /><br />Yes, the unthinkable is about to happen: Murderbot must voluntarily speak to humans!<br /><br />Again!<br /><br /><br /><b>A standalone adventure in the New York Times and USA Today-bestselling, Hugo and Nebula Award- winning series! </b>
