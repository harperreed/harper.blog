Two aliens have wandered Earth for centuries. The Changeling has survived by adapting the forms of many different organisms. The Chameleon destroys anything or anyone that threatens it.  
  
Now, a sunken relic that holds the key to their origins calls to them to take them homeâ€”but the Chameleon has decided there's only room for one.
