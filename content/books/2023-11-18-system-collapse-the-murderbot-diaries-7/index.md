<b>Everyone's favorite lethal SecUnit is back in the next installment in Martha Wells's <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Murderbot Diaries</i> series.</b><br /><br /><i>Am I making it worse? I think I'm making it worse.</i><br /><br />Everyone's favorite lethal SecUnit is back.<br /><br />Following the events in <i>Network Effect</i>, the Barish-Estranza corporation has sent rescue ships to a newly-colonized planet in peril, as well as additional SecUnits. But if there’s an ethical corporation out there, Murderbot has yet to find it, and if Barish-Estranza can’t have the planet, they’re sure as hell not leaving without <i>something</i>. If that something just happens to be an entire colony of humans, well, a free workforce is a decent runner-up prize.<br /><br />But there’s something wrong with Murderbot; it isn’t running within normal operational parameters. ART’s crew and the humans from Preservation are doing everything they can to protect the colonists, but with Barish-Estranza’s SecUnit-heavy persuasion teams, they’re going to have to hope Murderbot figures out what’s wrong with itself, and fast!<br /><br /><i>Yeah, this plan is... not going to work.</i>
