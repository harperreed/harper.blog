Not too long from now, when exiles from a blistering Earth huddle miserably in Martian colonies, the only things that make life bearable are the drugs. Can-D “translates” those who take it into the bodies of Barbie-like dolls. Now there's competition — a substance called Chew-Z, marketed under the slogan: “God promises eternal life. We can deliver it.” The question is: What kind of eternity? And who — or what — is the deliverer?<br /><br />In this wildly disorienting funhouse of a novel, populated by God-like — or perhaps Satanic — takeover artists and corporate psychics, Philip K. Dick explores mysteries that were once the property of St. Paul and Aquinas. His wit, compassion, and knife-edged irony make <i>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</i> moving as well as genuinely visionary.<br /><br />
