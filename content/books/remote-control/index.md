*The new book by Nebula and Hugo Award-winner, Nnedi Okorafor.*  
  
**"She’s the adopted daughter of the Angel of Death. Beware of her. Mind her. Death guards her like one of its own."**  
  
The day Fatima forgot her name, Death paid a visit. From hereon in she would be known as Sankofa­­--a name that meant nothing to anyone but her, the only tie to her family and her past.  
  
Her touch is death, and with a glance a town can fall. And she walks--alone, except for her fox companion--searching for the object that came from the sky and gave itself to her when the meteors fell and when she was yet unchanged; searching for answers.  
  
But is there a greater purpose for Sankofa, now that Death is her constant companion?
