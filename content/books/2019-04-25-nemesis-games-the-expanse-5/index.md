As wave after wave of colonists leave, the power structures of the old solar system begin to buckle.<br /><br />Ships are disappearing without a trace. Private armies are being secretly formed. The sole remaining protomolecule sample is stolen. Terrorist attacks previously considered impossible bring the inner planets to their knees.
