<strong>The mind-blowing new thriller from the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Dark Matter</em> and <em>Recursion</em> </strong><br /><br />“You are the next step in human evolution.”<br /><br />At first, Logan Ramsay isn’t sure if anything’s different. He just feels a little . . . sharper. Better able to concentrate. Better at multitasking. Reading a bit faster, memorizing better, needing less sleep.<br /><br />But before long, he can’t deny Something’s happening to his brain. To his body. He’s starting to see the world, and those around him—even those he loves most—in whole new ways.<br /><br />The truth is, Logan’s genome has been hacked. And there’s a reason he’s been targeted for this upgrade. A reason that goes back decades to the darkest part of his past, and a horrific family legacy.<br /><br />Worse still, what’s happening to him is just the first step in a much larger plan, one that will inflict the same changes on humanity at large—at a terrifying cost.<br /><br />Because of his new abilities, Logan’s the one person in the world capable of stopping what’s been set in motion. But to have a chance at winning this war, he’ll have to become something other than himself. Maybe even something other than human.<br /><br />And even as he’s fighting, he can’t help what if humanity’s only hope for a future really does lie in engineering our own evolution?<br /><br />Intimate in scale yet epic in scope, Upgrade is an intricately plotted, lightning-fast tale that charts one man’s thrilling transformation, even as it asks us to ponder the limits of our humanity—and our boundless potential.
