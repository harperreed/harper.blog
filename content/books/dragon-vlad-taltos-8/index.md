**In which Vlad Taltos finds himself, much to his surprise, at the fateful Battle of Baritt's Tomb**  
  
Marching through mud just isn't as much fun as they say.  
  
After years of surviving in Adrilankha by practicing the trade he knows best--killing people for a living--suddenly Vlad Taltos finds himself in the last place any self-respecting assassin wants to be: the army. Worse, he's right in the middle of a apocalyptic battle between two sorcerous armies, and everyone expects him to play a role they won't explain. All Vlad's got between him and the worst kind of death is his wits. Oh, and a smart-mouthed winged lizard...  
  
*Dragon* is Steven Brust at his best--a swashbuckling fantasy adventure.
