Legendary as an underground actress, female adventurer, and East Village raconteur, Cookie Mueller's first calling was to the written word: "I started writing when I was six and have never stopped completely," she once confessed. Mueller's 1990 <i>Walking through Clear Water in a Pool Painted Black</i>, the first volume of the Semiotext(e) Native Agents series, was the largest collection of stories she compiled during her life. But it presented only a slice of Mueller's prolific work as a writer. This new, landmark volume collects all of Mueller's stories: from the original contents of <i>Clear Water</i>, to additional stories discovered by Amy Scholder for the posthumous anthology <i>Ask Dr. Mueller</i>, to selections from Mueller's art and advice columns for <i>Details</i> and the <i>East Village Eye</i>, to still "new" stories collected and published here for the first time. Olivia Laing's new introduction situates Mueller's writing within the context of her life—and our times.<br /> <br />Thanks to recent documentaries like Mallory Curley's <i>A Cookie Mueller Encyclopedia</i> and Chloé Griffin's oral biography <i>Edgewise</i>, Mueller's life and work have been discovered by a new generation of readers. <i>Walking through Clear Water in a Pool Painted Black: Collected Stories</i> returns essential source material to these readers, the archive of Mueller's writing itself. Mueller's many mise en scènes—the Baltimore of John Waters, post-Stonewall Provincetown, avant-garde Italy, 1980s New York, an America enduring Reagan and AIDS—patches together a singular personal history and a primer for others. As Laing writes in her introduction, <i>Collected Stories</i> amounts to "a how-to manual for a life ricocheting joyously off the rails . . . a live corrective to conformity, conservatism, and cruelty."
