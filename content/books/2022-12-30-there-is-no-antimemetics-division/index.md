An antimeme is an idea with self-censoring properties; an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages or prevents people from spreading it.<br /><br />Antimemes are real. Think of any piece of information which you wouldn't share with anybody, like passwords, taboos and dirty secrets. Or any piece of information which would be difficult to share even if you tried: complex equations, very boring passages of text, large blocks of random numbers, and dreams...<br /><br />But anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain something you can't record or remember? How do you fight a war against an enemy with effortless, perfect camouflage, when you can never even know that you're at war?<br /><br />Welcome to the Antimemetics Division.<br /><br />No, this is not your first day.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />This ebook is an official release by me, qntm from the SCP Foundation wiki!
