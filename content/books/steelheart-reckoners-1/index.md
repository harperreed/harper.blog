How far would you go for revenge if someone killed your father?  
 If someone destroyed your city?  
 If everything you ever loved was taken from you?  
 David Charleston will go to any lengths to stop Steelheart. But to exact revenge in Steelheart’s world, David will need the Reckoners—a shadowy group of rebels bent on maintaining justice.   
 And it turns out that the Reckoners might just need David too.
