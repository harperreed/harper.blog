The astounding story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world - and did. Tremendous in scope, breathtaking in its suspense, "Atlas Shrugged" is unlike any other book you have ever read. It is a mystery story, not about the murder of a man's body, but about the murder - and rebirth - of man's spirit.<br /><br />With this acclaimed work and its immortal query "Who is John Galt?" Ayn Rand found the perfect artistic form to express her vision of existence. This is the book that made her not only one of the most popular novelists of our century, but also one of its most influential thinkers.
