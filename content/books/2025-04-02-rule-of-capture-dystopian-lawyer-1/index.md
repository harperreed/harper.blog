In *Rule of Capture*, the first book of the Dystopian Lawyer series, Christopher Brown immerses readers in a chillingly familiar world, blending the dark humor of *Better Call Saul* with the dystopian angst of *Nineteen Eighty-Four*. Set against the backdrop of a United States grappling with the aftermath of a catastrophic war with China, this gripping narrative explores themes of justice, loyalty, and survival.Newly ascended to power through dubious elections, a totalitarian regime is actively hunting down dissenters. Enter Donny Kimoe, a scrappy lawyer who finds his niche defending those facing the iron fist of government retribution. His latest client, Xelina Rocafuerte, a young filmmaker and witness to a politically motivated murder, is accused of terrorism. It’s up to Donny to navigate a judicial system that has entirely forsaken the realm of fairness and ethics.

As tensions rise and the stakes become lethal, Donny grapples with the consequences of his choices. With only days to prevent Xelina’s transfer to a notorious detention camp from which escape seems impossible, he must uncover buried truths surrounding the death of the opposition leader that will unveil a terrifying conspiracy. As the courtroom drama escalates into a revolution that could overturn the established order, Donny faces his toughest challenge yet: will he risk everything to save his client and possibly alter the course of a nation?

With an average Goodreads rating of 3.81 from 367 ratings and 30 reviews, *Rule of Capture* has captured the intrigue of readers who are looking for both a compelling legal thriller and a thought-provoking commentary on contemporary issues. This richly imagined debut from Christopher Brown offers a keen insight into the perils of justice in a collapsing society, making it a must-read for lovers of speculative fiction and legal dramas alike.
