**From an Aurora Award-winning author, a new sci-fi novel follows three intrepid humans caught up in a conflict that stretches across time and space.**  
  
Biologist Julie E. Czerneda's new standalone science fiction novel, *To Each This World* follows a desperate mission to reconnect with long lost sleeper ships, sent centuries earlier from Earth to settle distant worlds.  
  
A trio of Humans must work with their mysterious alien allies to rescue any descendants they can find on those worlds. Something is out there, determined to claim the cosmos for itself, and only on Earth will Humans be safe.  
  
Or will they?  
  
The challenge isn't just to communicate with your own kind after generations have passed. It's to understand what isn't your kind at all.  
  
And how far will trust take you, when the truth depends on what you are?
