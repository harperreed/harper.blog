<i>Jesus' Son</i>, the first collection of stories by Denis Johnson, presents a unique, hallucinatory vision of contemporary American life unmatched in power and immediacy and marks a new level of achievement for this acclaimed writer. In their intensity of perception, their neon-lit evocation of a strange world brought uncomfortably close to our own, the stories in <i>Jesus' Son</i> offer a disturbing yet eerily beautiful portrayal of American loneliness and hope.<br /><br />Contains:<br />Car Crash While Hitchhiking<br />Two Men<br />Out on Bail<br />Dundun<br />Work<br />Emergency<br />Dirty Wedding<br />The Other Man<br />Happy Hour<br />Steady Hands at Seattle General<br />Beverly Home'
