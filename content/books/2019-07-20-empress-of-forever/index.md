<b>“A classic space opera...a universe we’ve never seen before.” </b>—<b>Delilah S. Dawson, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author</b><br /><br /><b>From Hugo Award finalist Max Gladstone comes a smart, swashbuckling, wildly imaginative adventure; the saga of a rag-tag team of brilliant misfits, dangerous renegades, and enhanced outlaws in a war-torn future.</b><br /><br />A wildly successful innovator to rival Steve Jobs or Elon Musk, Vivian Liao is prone to radical thinking, quick decision-making, and reckless action. On the eve of her greatest achievement, she tries to outrun people who are trying to steal her success.<br /><br />In the chilly darkness of a Boston server farm, Viv sets her ultimate plan into motion. A terrifying instant later, Vivian Liao is catapulted through space and time to a far future where she confronts a destiny stranger and more deadly than she could ever imagine.<br /><br />The end of time is ruled by an ancient, powerful Empress who blesses or blasts entire planets with a single thought. Rebellion is literally impossible to consider--until Vivian Liao arrives. Trapped between the Pride—a ravening horde of sentient machines—and a fanatical sect of warrior monks who call themselves the Mirrorfaith, Viv must rally a strange group of allies to confront the Empress and find a way back to the world and life she left behind.<br /><br />A magnificent work of vivid imagination and universe-spanning action, <i>Empress of Forever</i> is a feminist <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> crossed with <i>Star Wars</i> and spiced with the sensibility and spirit of Iain M. Banks and William Gibson.<br /><br />At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.
