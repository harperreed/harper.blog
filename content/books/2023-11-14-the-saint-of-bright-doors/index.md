<b>
  <i>The Saint of Bright Doors</i>
</b> <b>sets the high drama of divine revolutionaries and transcendent cults against the mundane struggles of modern life, resulting in</b> <b>a novel that is revelatory and resonant.</b><br /><br />Fetter was raised to kill, honed as a knife to cut down his sainted father. This gave him plenty to talk about in therapy. <br /><br />He walked among invisible devils and anti-gods that mock the mortal form. He learned a lethal catechism, lost his shadow, and gained a habit for secrecy. After a blood-soaked childhood, Fetter escaped his rural hometown for the big city, and fell into a broader world where divine destinies are a dime a dozen.<br /><br />Everything in Luriat is more than it seems. Group therapy is recruitment for a revolutionary cadre. Junk email hints at the arrival of a god. Every door is laden with potential, and once closed may never open again. The city is scattered with Bright Doors, looming portals through which a cold wind blows. In this unknowable metropolis, Fetter will discover what kind of man he is, and his discovery will rewrite the world.<br /><br />At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.
