Candace Chen, a millennial living in NY, is devoted to routine. With the recent passing of her Chinese immigrant parents, she’s had her fill of uncertainty. She’s content just to carry on. So Candace barely notices when a plague of biblical proportions sweeps New York. Then Shen Fever spreads.   
  
Her bosses enlist her as part of a dwindling skeleton crew with a big end-date payoff. Soon entirely alone, she becomes the anonymous blogger NY Ghost.  
  
 Enter a group of survivors, led by IT tech Bob. They’re traveling to a place called the Facility, where, Bob promises, they will have everything they need to start society anew. Should Candace trust Bob?
