"Why Fish Don’t Exist: A Story of Loss, Love, and the Hidden Order of Life" by Lulu Miller presents a captivating exploration of resilience amidst chaos through the life of David Starr Jordan, an ambitious taxonomist. Jordan was a pivotal figure in the early 20th century science, credited with the discovery of nearly a fifth of all known fish. His story, however, unfolds against a backdrop of relentless natural disasters—lightning strikes, fires, and ultimately, the devastation of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which obliterated much of his life's work.

Miller's narrative begins with Jordan's tragic loss, laying bare the fragility of our pursuits when confronted with the chaotic forces of the universe. Rather than capitulate to despair, Jordan astonishingly rebuilt his collection, introducing innovations designed to withstand future turmoil. This determination serves as a metaphor for the human experience—how we confront loss and find a way to persevere.

As an NPR reporter, Miller encountered Jordan's life story and initially viewed it as a cautionary tale. Yet, as she faced her own struggles, her perspective shifted. She uncovered profound truths about history, morality, and the relentless force of nature—which resonate deeply within the narrative.

This book is a multi-faceted exploration that intertwines biography, memoir, and science, delivering a narrative that feels almost fable-like in its moral and existential inquiries. With an average rating of 4.15, the book has captivated over 50,000 readers, reflecting on the nature of existence in a beautifully articulated manner. Miller’s debut is not just an academic examination; it is a heartfelt tribute to those who seek to impose order in a world governed by chaos.
