**Now a Netflix original movie, this deeply scary and intensely unnerving novel follows a couple in the midst of a twisted unraveling of the darkest unease. You will be scared. But you won’t know why…**  
  
*I’m thinking of ending things. Once this thought arrives, it stays. It sticks. It lingers. It’s always there. Always.*  
   
 *Jake once said, “Sometimes a thought is closer to truth, to reality, than an action. You can say anything, you can do anything, but you can’t fake a thought.”*  
   
 *And here’s what I’m thinking: I don’t want to be here.*  
   
In this smart and intense literary suspense novel, Iain Reid explores the depths of the human psyche, questioning consciousness, free will, the value of relationships, fear, and the limitations of solitude. Reminiscent of Jose Saramago’s early work, Michel Faber’s cult classic *Under the Skin*, and Lionel Shriver’s *We Need to Talk about Kevin*, *“*your dread and unease will mount with every passing page” (*Entertainment Weekly*) of this edgy, haunting debut. Tense, gripping, and atmospheric, *I’m Thinking of Ending Things* pulls you in from the very first page…and never lets you go.
