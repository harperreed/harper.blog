The much-anticipated new novel from the internationally acclaimed, best-selling author of *1Q84* and *Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage*, *Killing Commendatore* is an epic tour de force of love and loneliness, war and art—as well as a loving homage to *The Great Gatsby*—and a stunning work of imagination from one of our greatest writers.
