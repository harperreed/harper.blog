  <i>“When they said all happy families are alike, I don’t think this is what they meant…”</i>
</b><br /><br />Evelyn Caldwell’s husband Nathan has been having an affair — with Evelyn Caldwell. Or, to be exact, with a genetically cloned replica.<br /><br />After a morning that begins with a confrontation and ends with Nathan’s body bleeding out on the kitchen floor, the two Caldwell wives will have to think fast—before sharing everything includes sharing a jail cell.<br /><br /><i>The Echo Wife<i> is a non-stop thrill ride of lies, betrayal, and identity, perfect for fans of <i>Big Little Lies</i> and <i>Killing Eve</i>.</i></i>
