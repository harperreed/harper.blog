Dazzling space battles, intergalactic politics, and rogue AI collide in *Velocity Weapon*, the first book in this epic space opera by award-winning author Megan O'Keefe.
  


Sanda and Biran Greeve were siblings destined for greatness. A high-flying sergeant, Sanda has the skills to take down any enemy combatant. Biran is a savvy politician who aims to use his new political position to prevent conflict from escalating to total destruction. 

  


However, on a routine maneuver, Sanda loses consciousness when her gunship is blown out of the sky. Instead of finding herself in friendly hands, she awakens 230 years later on a deserted enemy warship controlled by an AI who calls himself Bero. The war is lost. The star system is dead. Ada Prime and its rival Icarion have wiped each other from the universe.

  


Now, separated by time and space, Sanda and Biran must fight to put things right.
