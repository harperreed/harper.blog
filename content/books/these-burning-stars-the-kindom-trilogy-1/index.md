In 'These Burning Stars,' the first book of The Kindom Trilogy, debut author Bethany Jacobs unveils a thrilling space opera filled with intrigue, revenge, and moral ambiguity. Set against the backdrop of an expansive empire that spans star systems, we journey alongside Jun Ironway, a cunning hacker and occasional thief, who holds onto a dangerous secret: evidence that could implicate the powerful Nightfoot family in a devastating genocide conducted seventy-five years ago. This contraband could serve as her ticket to freedom—or as a death warrant, as the Nightfoots maintain a stranglehold on the precious sevite, a resource essential for interplanetary travel.

The narrative intensifies as the Kindom, the ruling power of the star systems, sends their formidable clerics—Chono, a preternaturally stoic enforcer, and Esek, a fiery young heir to the Nightfoot empire—to hunt Jun down. However, the stakes rise further with the enigmatic figure from their past, known only as Six, appearing to orchestrate events from the shadows. Each character wrestles not only with their own secrets but also with their complicity in the systemic oppression, as their quest for truth may dismantle the very fabric of their society.

'These Burning Stars' captivates readers with its explosive twists and compelling character dynamics, inviting us to ponder the cost of revenge and the potential for redemption in a galaxy plagued by violence and ambition. With an average rating of 4.18 from over 2,800 readers on Goodreads, it's recognized as a top contender in the sci-fi genre for 2023. 

Bethany Jacobs, an emerging voice in speculative fiction, weaves a tale that resonates with fans of Arkady Martine and Kameron Hurley, blending action, rich world-building, and complex character arcs. As stories of interstellar conspiracy and personal vendetta converge, every decision could tip the balance of power—or lead to ruin.
