NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER  
A GOOD MORNING AMERICA Book Club Pick!  
  
A magnificent new novel from the Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguroâ€”author of Never Let Me Go and the Booker Prize-winning The Remains of the Day.  
  
Klara and the Sun, the first novel by Kazuo Ishiguro since he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, tells the story of Klara, an Artificial Friend with outstanding observational qualities, who, from her place in the store, watches carefully the behavior of those who come in to browse, and of those who pass on the street outside. She remains hopeful that a customer will soon choose her.  
  
Klara and the Sun is a thrilling book that offers a look at our changing world through the eyes of an unforgettable narrator, and one that explores the fundamental question: what does it mean to love?
