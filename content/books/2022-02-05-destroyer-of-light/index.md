<b>Reminiscent of China Miéville and Octavia Butler, Jennifer Marie Brissett, author of <i>Elysium</i>, has created a disturbing and haunting sf narrative in <i>Destroyer of Light</i>, interweaving mythology with interdimensional aliens, human refuges, child soldiers, and genetic engineering.</b><br /><br />Over three hundred years in the future, all humans on the planet Eleusis are refugees following the alien destruction of Earth.<br /><br />Within this society of haves and have-nots, of criminals and dissidents, of former alien conquerors claiming a desire for peaceful cohabitation, three stories intertwine: a young girl abducted by a violent warlord, twin brothers searching for the lost son of a human/alien couple, and a young woman with extraordinary powers who’s risen through the insurgent ranks in the borderlands called Night.<br /><br />Their stories skate across years to build towards one moment, when the fate of all—human and alien—hangs in the balance.
