When they come for her, Sergeant Parks keeps his gun pointing at her while two of his people strap her into the wheelchair. She jokes that she won't bite, but they don't laugh.<br /><br /><i>The Girl with All the Gifts</i> is a groundbreaking thriller, emotionally charged and gripping from beginning to end.
