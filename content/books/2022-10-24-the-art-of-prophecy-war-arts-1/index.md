<b>An epic fantasy ode to martial arts and magic—the story of a spoiled hero, an exacting grandmaster, and an immortal god-king from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of <i>The Lives of Tao</i>.</b><br /><br />It has been foretold: A child will rise to defeat the Eternal Khan, a cruel immortal god-king, and save the kingdom. <br /> <br />The hero: Jian, who has been raised since birth in luxury and splendor, celebrated before he has won a single battle. <br /> <br />But the prophecy was wrong. <br /> <br />Because when Taishi, the greatest war artist of her generation, arrives to evaluate the prophesied hero, she finds a spoiled brat unprepared to face his destiny. <br /> <br />But the only force more powerful than fate is Taishi herself. Possessed of an iron will, a sharp tongue—and an unexpectedly soft heart—Taishi will find a way to forge Jian into the weapon and leader he needs to be in order to fulfill his legend. <br /> <br />What follows is a journey more wondrous than any prophecy can foresee: a story of master and student, assassin and revolutionary, of fallen gods and broken prophecies, and of a war between kingdoms, and love and friendship between deadly rivals.
