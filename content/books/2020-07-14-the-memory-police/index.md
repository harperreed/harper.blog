A deft and dark Orwellian novel about the terrors of state surveillance, from the acclaimed author of <em>The Housekeeper and the Professor</em>.<br /><br />On an unnamed island off an unnamed coast, things are disappearing. First, animals and flowers. Then objects—ribbons, bells, photographs. Then, body parts. Most of the island’s inhabitants fail to notice these changes, while those few imbued with the power to recall the lost objects live in fear of the mysterious “memory police,” who are committed to ensuring that the disappeared remain forgotten. When a young novelist realizes that more than her career is in danger, she hides her editor beneath her floorboards, and together, as fear and loss close in around them, they cling to literature as the last way of preserving the past. Part allegory, part literary thriller, <em>The Memory Police</em> is a stunning new work from one of the most exciting contemporary authors writing in any language.
