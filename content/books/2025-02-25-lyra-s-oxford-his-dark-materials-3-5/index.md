<i>Lyra's Oxford</i> opens two years after the conclusion of Philip Pullman's <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> in the comfort and familiarity of Jordan College, where Lyra and her daemon, Pantalaimon, sit on the sun-drenched roof looking out over all of Oxford.<br /><br />But their peace is shattered when a strange bird — a witch's daemon, on it's own — tumbles out of the sky, in search of a healing elixer to cure his witch of a strange new disease. Lyra and Pan decided to help — witches are friends, of course — but the closer their winding walk leads them towards the infamous Oxford alchemist, the stronger Lyra's sense that something is amiss.<br /><br />Cover illustration and engravings by John Lawrence<br /><br />
