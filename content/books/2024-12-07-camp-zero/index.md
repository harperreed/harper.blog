*Camp Zero*, penned by the talented Michelle Min Sterling, is a captivating exploration of climate change's impact on society, focusing on a northern Canadian settlement that serves as a refuge for those displaced by environmental devastation. This thought-provoking narrative features Rose, a young woman who bravely travels to Camp Zero, presumably an American building project shrouded in secrecy, to investigate its architect in hopes of securing housing for her climate-displaced mother. 

Upon her arrival, she meets Grant, an academic seeking to escape his family's oppressive legacy. Together, they unravel disturbing truths about the camp, leading them to uncover the existence of an elite group of women soldiers stationed at a nearby climate research facility. As they navigate the complexities of survival in a world where gender, class, and migration intersect, Sterling's novel evokes comparisons to acclaimed titles like *Station Eleven* and *The Power*, challenging readers to consider the moral dilemmas that accompany a changing climate.
