**Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2020 by Apple Books, *Literary Hub*, *The Millions*, and *The Week*  
  
  
  
An indelible novel of teenage alienation and adult complacency in an unraveling world.**


  
Pulitzer Prize finalist Lydia Millet’s sublime new novel—her first since the National Book Award long-listed *Sweet Lamb of Heaven*—follows a group of twelve eerily mature children on a forced vacation with their families at a sprawling lakeside mansion.

  
Contemptuous of their parents, who pass their days in a stupor of liquor, drugs, and sex, the children feel neglected and suffocated at the same time. When a destructive storm descends on the summer estate, the group’s ringleaders—including Eve, who narrates the story—decide to run away, leading the younger ones on a dangerous foray into the apocalyptic chaos outside.

  
As the scenes of devastation begin to mimic events in the dog-eared picture Bible carried around by her beloved little brother, Eve devotes herself to keeping him safe from harm.

  
*A Children’s Bible* is a prophetic, heartbreaking story of generational divide—and a haunting vision of what awaits us on the far side of Revelation.
