    <p>The critically acclaimed <i>A Corpse in the Koryo </i>brought readers into the enigmatic workings of North Korean intelligence with the introduction of a new kind of detective---the mysterious Inspector O. In the follow-up, <i>Hidden Moon,</i> O threaded his way through the minefield of North Korean ministries into a larger conspiracy he was never supposed to touch.<br /><br />Now the inspector returns . . .<br /><br />In the winter of 1997, trying to stay alive during a famine that has devastated much of North Korea, Inspector O is ordered to play host to an Israeli agent who appears in Pyongyang. When the wife of a North Korean diplomat in Pakistan dies under suspicious circumstances, O is told to investigate, with a curious proviso: Donâ€™t look too closely at the details, and stay away from the question of missiles. O knows he canâ€™t avoid finding out what he is supposed to ignore on a trail that leads him from the dark, chilly rooms of Pyongyang to an abandoned secret facility deep in the countryside, guarded by a lonely general; and from the streets of New York to a bench beneath a horse chestnut tree on the shores of Lake Geneva, where the Inspector discovers he is up to his ears in missiles---and worse. Stalked by the past and wary of the future, O is convinced there is no one he can trust, and no one he canâ€™t suspect. Swiss intelligence wants him out of the country; someone else wants him dead.<br /><br />Once again, James Churchâ€™s spare, lyrical prose guides readers through an unfamiliar landscape of whispered words and shadows, a world wrapped in a level of mystery and complexity that few outsiders have experienced. With Inspector O, noir has a new home in North Korea, and James Church holds the keys.</p>
