Here are four urgent stories from author and activist Cory Doctorow, four social, technological and economic visions of the world today and its near—all too near—future.  
  
'Unauthorized Bread' is a tale of immigration, toxic economic stratification and a young woman's perilously illegal quest to fix a broken toaster.  
  
In 'Model Minority' a superhero finds himself way out his depth when he confronts the corruption of the police and justice system.  
  
'Radicalized' is the story of a desperate husband, a darknet forum and the birth of a violent uprising against the US health care system.  
  
The final story, 'The Masque of the Red Death', tracks an uber-wealthy survivalist and his followers as they hole up and attempt to ride out the collapse of society.
