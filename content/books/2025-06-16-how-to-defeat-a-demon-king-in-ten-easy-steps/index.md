How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps is a witty and engaging take on the classic hero's journey, authored by Andrew Rowe, a noteworthy voice in the LitRPG/GameLit genre. The narrative revolves around Yui Shaw, a young woman faced with an extraordinary challenge: for centuries, the cycle of a Demon King rising to power and a Hero answering the call to save the world has continued unabated. However, after just 23 years since the last uprising, indications show that the current Demon King has already established his reign over half of the planet, leaving humanity on the brink of extinction if they don’t act fast. 

Yui doesn’t wait for the foretold Hero; instead, she constructs a bold 10-step plan to claim the legendary Hero's sword, enhance her skills through various peculiar class changes, and navigate treacherous dungeons seemingly crafted for only the chosen one. Along her journey, filled with humor and clever nods to iconic video games like The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy, she begins to realize that she might not be the Hero she planned to be—but that doesn’t mean she can’t play the part well enough to make a difference.

At its heart, this novel explores themes of bravery, self-discovery, and the nature of heroism. With an average rating of 4.02 based on over 8,000 ratings, readers appreciate Rowe's unique narrative style and the satirical lens through which he addresses tropes of traditional fantasy storytelling. Whether you’re a fan of gaming culture or simply looking for a fun romp through a fantastical realm, Yui's journey promises laughter and excitement at every turn.
