<i>Black Boy</i> is a classic of American autobiography, a subtly crafted narrative of Richard Wright's journey from innocence to experience in the Jim Crow South. An enduring story of one young man's coming of age during a particular time and place, <i>Black Boy</i> remains a seminal text in our history about what it means to be a man, black, and Southern in America.
