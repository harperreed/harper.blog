"Orbital" is a captivating novel by acclaimed author Samantha Harvey, known for her poignant explorations of the human experience. This work stands as a meditation on life and the environment, seen through the eyes of astronauts journeying around the Earth in a 24-hour cycle. Following its release, the book garnered an average rating of 3.63 on Goodreads, reflecting both praise and critical feedback from readers.

The narrative centers on a diverse crew of six astronauts and cosmonauts from around the globe, embarking on what is likely one of the last missions of its kind. As they orbit the planet at remarkable speeds exceeding seventeen thousand miles per hour, readers are invited to witness their small moments of daily life in spaceâ€”those intimate glances at Earth, the preparation of dehydrated meals, and the necessity of physical exercise in a gravity-free environment.

Harvey enriches the text with glimpses into their pasts: artifacts and images they bring aboard, along with fleeting, poignant communications with their loved ones back on Earth. The experience of each crew member unfolds across a series of sunrises and sunsets, under the backdrop of distant stars, lending the novel an emotional depth that resonates with feelings of awe and introspection.

Critics have praised "Orbital" for its 'ravishing beauty,' harkening to the work's ability to capture both the grandeur of space and the fragile nature of our planet, making it a thoughtful elegy for the environment we call home. This novel challenges readers to reflect on the connection between humanity and the vast cosmos, ultimately inspiring a deeper appreciation for life on Earth.
