<i>Into Everywhere</i> moves from a desert world littered with the ruins and enigmatic artifacts of a dozen former clients of the Jackaroo, through a quest across a brutally pragmatic interstellar empire, to a world almost as old as the universe.<br /><br /><i>Something Coming Through</i> and its sequel, <i>Into Everywhere</i>, extend, explore and complete the near future shared by the popular and highly acclaimed short stories in the Jackaroo sequence, including 'The Choice', which won the 2012 Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award.<br /><br />They present new perspectives on one of the central ideas of science and science-fiction - are we alone in the universe? - through two separate narratives.
