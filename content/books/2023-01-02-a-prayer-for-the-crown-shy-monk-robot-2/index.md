After touring the rural areas of Panga, Sibling Dex (a Tea Monk of some renown) and Mosscap (a robot sent on a quest to determine what humanity really needs) turn their attention to the villages and cities of the little moon they call home.<br /><br />They hope to find the answers they seek, while making new friends, learning new concepts, and experiencing the entropic nature of the universe.<br /><br />Becky Chambers's new series continues to ask: in a world where people have what they want, does having more even matter?<br /><br />They're going to need to ask it a lot.
