In "Needle," published by Mythic Island Press in July 2022, author Linda Nagata captivates readers once again in the third volume of the acclaimed Inverted Frontier series. This thought-provoking science fiction novel pushes the boundaries of exploration, knowledge, and the nature of existence.

Set against the backdrop of the Tanjiri system—an area brimming with ancient ruins and a living moon created just 4,000 years ago—the narrative follows Urban, a reluctant hero confronted with the enigmatic artifact given to him by Lezuri. This ultra-thin, twelve-centimeter needle is said to contain all of Lezuri's knowledge, but its secrets remain locked away, waiting for someone bold enough to unravel its mysteries.

As the fleet of Dragon reaches the outskirts of the Tanjiri system, Urban senses the presence of an entity that transcends even the knowledge of Lezuri, yet this system is eerily silent. Urban is determined to discover the truth and meet this maker of worlds, understanding that the stakes are higher than ever: the lives of those he cares about hang in the balance. Armed with the needle, Urban must uncover its secrets and confront potential dangers as he prepares to enter the unknown.

Linda Nagata, known for her insightful storytelling that combines speculative technology with deep philosophical questions, delivers a gripping narrative enriched with vivid world-building. With an average rating of 4.24 based on 594 reviews on Goodreads, readers have praised the intricate plotting and character development that pervade this series.

"Needle" promises to be an electrifying addition to the Inverted Frontier saga, challenging its protagonist—and its readers—to confront the complexities of knowledge, existence, and the true meaning of power.
