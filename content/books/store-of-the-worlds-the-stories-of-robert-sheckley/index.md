Robert Sheckley was science fiction’s in-house reply to the  
 black humorists of the 1950s and 60s: Bruce Jay Friedman,  
 Terry Southern, and the young Thomas Pynchon were his nonetoo-  
 distant relatives; Mort Sahl’s comedy, Charles Schultz’s  
 cartoons, and Tom Lehrer’s songs all mined similar veins.  
 Sheckley targeted the conformity and consumerism of our  
 mid-century technotopia while it was still under construction.  
 His new worlds, alternate universes, and future dystopias have  
 only become more present with the passing years, even as his  
 career, played out both in the pulp magazines and in front-line  
 venues like *Playboy* and *Omni*, is a glimpse of a time when  
 “science fiction writer” could be a kind of hipster credential.  
 Mordant, absurdist, and deadpan, the best of Sheckley’s dissident  
 farces represent science fiction’s high-water mark as an  
 allegorical clearinghouse for twenty-century angst.
