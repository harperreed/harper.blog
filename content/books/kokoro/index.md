Hailed by The New Yorker as *"rich in understanding and insight,"* Kokoro — *"the heart of things"* — is the work of one of Japan's most popular authors. This thought-provoking trilogy of stories explores the very essence of loneliness and stands as a stirring introduction to modern Japanese literature.
