August 1969 San Francisco. Ajax Penumbra seeks a book--the single surviving copy of the <i>Techne Tycheon</i>, a mysterious volume that has brought and lost great fortune for anyone who has owned it. Late one night, after another day of dispiriting dead ends, he stumbles across a 24-hour bookstore, and the possibilities before him expand exponentially.
