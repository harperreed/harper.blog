He coined the term "cyberspace..."He envisioned both the Internet and virtual reality before either existed...  
  
Now, the **New York Times** bestselling author of **Neuromancer** returns with his hero from **Idoru**, in a startling novel of a shift in time--and cyberspace...  
  
"**All Tomorrow's Parties** is immensely engaging, alive on every page and as enjoyable a weekend entertainment as one could want."--**The Washington Post Book World**   
  
"**William Gibson**'s rich protopointillism coins a wireless future where reality is only proxy and proviso. Made all the more beautiful and frightening by its probability, and by characters who somehow tweeze hope from the polymer." --**Chris Carter**, creator of **The X-Files**  
  
"One of science fiction's greatest literary stylists...Gibson wouldn't be Gibson if he spelled it out, if he eliminated all the ambiguity. His specialty is hanging on to that fractal edge without ever going over the brink." --**Wired Magazine**
