It calls itself Murderbot, but only when no one can hear.<br /><br />It worries about the fragile human crew who've grown to trust it, but only where no one can see.<br /><br />It tells itself that they're only a professional obligation, but when they're captured and an old friend from the past requires urgent assistance, Murderbot must choose between inertia and drastic action.<br /><br />Drastic action it is, then.
