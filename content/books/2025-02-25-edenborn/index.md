It is 18 years after IDLEWILD and the survivors are now adults. A bitter and disillusioned Halloween has chosen to exile himself but his peers seek to repopulate the Earth and rebuild civilization. They are mankind's last, best and perhaps only hope. However an ideological split has divided them into two very different societies: one looks to resurrect the human race, the other to improve humanity via genetic manipulation. So a new generation of children is born, but as they mature it becomes clear that all is not well. Someone - or something - is moving against them, even as Black Ep, the plague that claimed billions of lives, returns in search of new victims. The survivors must work together, but to save the future Halloween must first let go of the past...<br /><br /><br />Thrilling, post-apocalyptic yet written with an arcing sense of wonder, EDENBORN is the next visionary chapter in the Idlewild story by one of speculative fiction's most exciting new voices.
