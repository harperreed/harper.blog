The author of the ground-breaking science-fiction novels <i>Neuromancer</i> and <i>Virtual Light</i> returns with a fast-paced, high-density, cyber-punk thriller. As prophetic as it is exciting, <i>Idoru</i> takes us to 21st century Tokyo where both the promises of technology and the disasters of cyber-industrialism stand in stark contrast, where the haves and the have-nots find themselves walled apart, and where information and fame are the most valuable and dangerous currencies.<br /><br />When Rez, the lead singer for the rock band Lo/Rez is rumored to be engaged to an "idoru" or "idol singer" - an artificial celebrity creation of information software agents - 14-year-old Chia Pet McKenzie is sent by the band's fan club to Tokyo to uncover the facts. At the same time, Colin Laney, a data specialist for Slitscan television, uncovers and publicizes a network scandal. He flees to Tokyo to escape the network's wrath. As Chia struggles to find the truth, Colin struggles to preserve it, in a futuristic society so media-saturated that only computers hold the hope for imagination, hope and spirituality.
