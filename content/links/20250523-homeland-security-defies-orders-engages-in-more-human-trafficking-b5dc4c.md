summary: In a bizarre twist of governmental defiance, the Homeland Security has found
  itself embroiled in controversy, engaging in human trafficking by sending individuals
  to a perilous destination despite glaring legal objections. It's a dark comedy of
  errors where due process seems to have taken a backseat, and the punchline is anything
  but funny.
