my room is 100 degrees hot. that is really hot. very very hot. This week is going to be exciting. I got KMFDM tickets. I am excited to juggle. I met a bunch of cool new people this weekend. and everything has the potential to gather itself together. we shall see how things go. heh. chicago is fun. I like it here. <br/>
