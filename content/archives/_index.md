# My old blog: nata2.org

From 2000 to 2015 I blogged regularly at [nata2.org](https://web.archive.org/web/*/nata2.org). I wrote around *1416* posts and covered anything from technology to my (early 2000s) dating life. It was a lot of fun and was a great outlet. Around the launch of Twitter (~2006/2007), I stopped doing updating the site regularly. **Here be dragons**.

Here is an archive of all of those posts.
