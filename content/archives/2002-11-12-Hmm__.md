excerpt: I am watching red dawn. whoa. that movie is very interesting. especially
  in light of the current situation with our world. I wouldn't be surprised if an
  offensive was targeted on U.S. soil if a military action was initiated. I juggled
  for 25min tonight. practicing doubles - and all that jazz.
