So my did in fact inadvertantly deleted all of the info on one of my servers. I called and asked<br>
"<i>why</i>"<br>
"<i>well, it had a kernal problem.. it needed a reburn</i>"<br>
"<i>have you heard of a boot disk?</i>"<br>
I guess not huh... well damnit.. heh i guess everything is OK. i didn't lose anything special - just 40hrs of fresh php virtual host admin tools, about 30hrs of mysql work, 20hrs of system stuff, and about 10hrs of system configuration... alas.. i guess its nothing...<b>:(</b>
