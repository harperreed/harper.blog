I was glancing at my order history on amazon.com and I noticed that I have ordered a lot of stuff. I shoudl relaly save my money I suppose. here is a breakdown. a lot of these orders may have been one book. or may have been many books. 
<blockquote><small>
2 orders in 1997<br/>
5 orders in 1998<br/>
5 orders in 1999<br/>
14 orders in 2000<bR>
16 orders in 2001<br/>
32 orders in 2002<br/>
38 orders in 2003<br/>
4 orders in 2004<br/>
</small></blockquote>So yea. I feel silly. but whatever. I guess amazon has become quite the online retailer.. or shoudl I say e-tailer.. haha. I wonder whatever happened to cdnow. and I bet you can't guess when I was in college ;)
