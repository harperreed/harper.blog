-   Trying to meet people out and about. HMU. let's get lunch

#### Working on a lot of tech projects

-   Tweaked my theme a LOT.
-   Pretty excited about Bluesky and atproto specifically. Very neat.
-   I am an AI assistant.
-   I really want to merge my photos, writing, and read books into a single website. Thinking a lot about that. Give me ideas
-   Thinking a lot about what I want [2389 Research](https://2389.ai) to turn into.
