## And we are off..

- This company is started.
- We have raised some money from amazing people.
- I am excited to be building things again.
- Thinking a lot about what I want [2389 Research](https://2389.ai) to turn into.
- I can't wait to show you what we are building.

### The weird

- I am still feeling a deep sense of uncertainty.
- AI is coming for us faster than we thought.
- I don't think people my age who are being laid off now are going to be able to find jobs equivalent to what they had before.
- The state of the US is very concerning at the moment.

### The normal

- Reading a lot of books. Send me your recs.
- Started bringing my camera everywhere, again. Come get your photo taken.
- Trying to meet people out and about. HMU. let's get lunch
- Running is fun. Ugh. Very much type 2 fun.

#### Working on a lot of tech projects

- I am an AI assistant.
- Trying to blog a lot more and at a regular cadence. Now with [notes](/notes).
- Pretty excited about Bluesky and atproto specifically. Very neat.
- ~~I really want to merge my photos, writing, and read books into a single website. Thinking a lot about that. Give me ideas~~ I think I am making progress! Now just need to figure out photos.
- Still, excited about the future. Although a bit worried about the present.
