* Shut down my company!
* Playing a bunch with A.I. and ML. (like everyone). The world is going to be really strange.
* Doing a lot of email (email me [harper@modest.com](mailto:harper@modest.com)).
* Hanging with my weird family.
* Playing with my new camera (M11!!)
* Traveling some.
* Started Journeling daily (nearly 300 days so far!).
* Excited for the future.
* Trying to figure out what to build next.
