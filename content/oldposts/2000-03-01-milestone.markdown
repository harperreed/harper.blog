Today, after class, i walked from the library to the field museum it was like 3 miles... i haven't walked that far in like 4 years... hehe.. it was fun though.. i stoped in the SONY store looking for an AIBO, but it was no where to be found. I found out that the aquarium is open for free on monday, the museum of contemporary art is open for free on tuesday and the field museum is open for free on wednesday... lucky days... i hope to go see my friends play at northwestern... and maybe i will be able to go back home to see my other friends play... hmm...
