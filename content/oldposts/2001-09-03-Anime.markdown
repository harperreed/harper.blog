i really don't know if i like anime or not. At first the fascination was based on experiencing something i had never experienced before. Then it got wierd. I kinda liked it because i was supposed to like it - according to the code of computer nerd. But now i am starting to get more into it. I just saw <a href="http://www.bloodthemovie.com">blood</a> and it was really good. It was by the guys who did <b>ghost in the shell</b>, which i really enjoy. I am hopeing to watch and discover more anime. and maybe just maybe i will convince others that it is fun.. i guess i need a dvd player...
