# Translations of Harper.Blog

I have recently spent some time making my blog and some of its content accessible in other languages besides English. Currently, some blog posts have been translated, but very little of the general media (such as photos, books, and links) is available in other languages. I am prioritizing the translation of blog posts and may work on translating the rest later.

I started this project because I received requests for translations of a few blog popular posts. Later, as part of a [work](https://2389.ai) project, I wrote [a simple translation agent](https://github.com/2389-research/translator) that does a reasonable job of translating blog posts.

This has allowed me to support translations in languages other than English.

## Current Translations

## Future Translations

I would like to support:

- Korean
- Chinese
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Italian

We shall see how it goes
