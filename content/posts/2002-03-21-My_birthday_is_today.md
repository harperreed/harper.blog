today is my bday. I will sing a little song:<br/>
i am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. <br/>
good song huh. <br/><br/>I found a cool <a href="i am 24.. I am 24.. I am 24.. ">winamp plugin</a> that allows me to weight songs on a playlist.. which means that my playlists at work have 3000 songs(i own all the cds.. actually I really do.. wierd huh) and they are good. not shite. so I get def lepard rather than warrent, and ministry rather than geri haliway. <br/>
