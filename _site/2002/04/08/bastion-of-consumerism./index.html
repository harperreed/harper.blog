    <p>I just finished watching ghost world. I am not sure if my time has been wasted or not. I don&rsquo;t think so. But you never know. heh. this weekend was quite good. I had a lot of friends over and went out to a lot of clubs. I also spent far too much money for the amount of return I got.  But that is OK. It was really funa dn I was able to lose all of my worries for one weekend. It was really great to see kinnera for awhile. I really miss hanging out with her. Sometimes my dreams are contrary to reality. but alas.. <br/>
last night we went out around 10:30 to a club called rednofive for some dj tha didn&rsquo;t even show up. something to do with immigration.. then we went to liars club. which was mediocre as always.. and then to crobar. hah. what a trip that was. it was quite a night.  10:30 till 5. hah. hehe. slept all today. I suppose I should not fsck my sleep partners up any more then they are already. but whatever.
<br/>i am getting excited about timelapse.com. <br/>i really want to date people.. but its hard. the city is sometimes so lonely. it is funny how pathetic that is. but its true. maybe I should get my guts up to ask someone out or something. that would be a start.</p>
