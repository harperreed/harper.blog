      <description>This is exciting. Obama is the first candidate I have ever donated money too. Hopefully this will enable his campaign to get enough traction to win on a national level. Hopefully it is Obama and Huckabee against each other. Because then we either get Obama - who is pretty awesome, or Huckabee who is an insane person. INSANE. So either the U.S. will be in a place to repair, or a place to engage in a Holy war with the world.</description>
