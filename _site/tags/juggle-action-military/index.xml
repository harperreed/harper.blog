      <description>I am watching red dawn. whoa. that movie is very interesting. especially in light of the current situation with our world. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if an offensive was targeted on U.S. soil if a military action was initiated. I juggled for 25min tonight. practicing doubles - and all that jazz.</description>
