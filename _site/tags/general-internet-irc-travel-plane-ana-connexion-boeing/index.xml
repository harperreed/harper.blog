      <description>I am currently flying at 36000 feet and&amp;nbsp;going around 600mph. I am using my laptop and its connected to the planes wifi. Weird. I didn&#39;t know planes had wifi. hah. But apparently this one does. And more importantly, its free cuz they are canceling it soon.&amp;nbsp; Its from the Connextion by Boeing, which is basically Boeing hooking satellite Internet to its planes. Apparently they didn&#39;t get the proper customer response that they wanted.</description>
