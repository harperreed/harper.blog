      <description>This weekend was pretty nice. I went to colorado to help my dad with his webpage, visit my family and for mothersday. I always forget how pretty it is in colorado. I am always a bit surprised when i see the mountains or the sunset. Also the weather is so nice. a lot nicer than chicago. Especially this weekend.
I got in late on friday and i just ate easy mac, slept and read a bit.</description>
