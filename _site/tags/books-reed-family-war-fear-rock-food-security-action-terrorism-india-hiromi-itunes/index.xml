      <description>Ok Ok. so I have been reading Anna Karenina. It is amazing. seriously - possibly one of the better books I have ever read. I am fascinated with how thorough Tolstoy covers the story. and how the story seemingly covers everything. it is soo good. I love the feeling of want that is associated with reading a good book.. right now I feel that the only thing that could satisfy my want is to go home and read that book - or write a web app to do fancy things with itunes.</description>
