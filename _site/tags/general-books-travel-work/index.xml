      <description>I just finished the newest harry potter book. I quite enjoyed it. (i have turned the spiolers white - unless you are in an RSS reader)I was of course about dumbledore&amp;rsquo;s demise and snape turning(hah) evil. but i was more bummed about harry&amp;rsquo;s ejection of ginny. WHY. they are so cute. hahaha. 
anyway. i am &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo; at Tommie&amp;rsquo;s house here in Brooklyn - with internet and directtv. stuck isn&amp;rsquo;t so much the situation as i didn&amp;rsquo;t really make any moves to find another place to stay.</description>
