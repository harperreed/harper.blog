      <description>So.. a friend of mine messaged me and was rather freaked out by the fact that a online celebrity RPG was stalking her. heh. I did a bit of research and I noticed that the entire kill hannah group is enveloped in this stupid internet false world. hehe. weird. sometimes the world is insane. INSANE I say. what are peoples fascination with death in june and boyd rice. why is it that people will defend these bands as not being racist, fascist, misanthropic or generally skinhead-ish.</description>
