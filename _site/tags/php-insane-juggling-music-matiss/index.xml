      <description>my shirt is causing my neck to turn red. usually this isn&amp;rsquo;t a good thing. but today it is awesome. !!! i got up so early today. it is weird to be up so damn early. nobody is out and around - but somehow I still managed to come to work barely by nine. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite understand how this works. I leave my house anywhere from 8-8:30ish and get here everyday at nine.</description>
