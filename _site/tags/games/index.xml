      <description>So tonight I went out wth a bunch of friends to game works in schaumberg. It was quite fun. had an OK hamburger, paid too much for that and a beer. played $35 dollars worth of games in 1.5 hours and then rode in a car going buck 20 down 90, only to bring us to a great wine bar where I drank some wine. I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about wine.</description>
