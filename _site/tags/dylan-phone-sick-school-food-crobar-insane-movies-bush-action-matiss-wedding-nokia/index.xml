      <description>this weekend was awesome. on thursday I hung out with a dope friend - we got dinner and drinks - it was pretty nice. I went home for a quick stop to say hi to my friends who were staying and then went to crobar - where a bunch of friends were. we somehow made it to vips. hahah. whatever. ;) then I went to bed. I find it pretty weird that I consider thursday the beginning of the weekend.</description>
