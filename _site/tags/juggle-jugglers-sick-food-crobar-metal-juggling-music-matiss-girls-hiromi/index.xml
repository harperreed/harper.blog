      <description>i woke up this morning with both a strange sickness in my throat and an feeling that I had lost all ability to type. it was weird. this weekend was pretty good. I basically just hung out with some friends, saw some good shows and all that nonsense. It all started on thrusday. oh yea. crobar. we all hung out. hiromi was drinking a little more than she usually does so that was hilarious.</description>
