      <description>I am so tired today. I wish I was a simple web app designer. Soemtimes I don&amp;rsquo;t really like my job. This is the first time I have used this blog to vent about my employment. I feel bad venting. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have anywhere else to go.. ;). I am frustrated at what I see as unprogressive movement. It isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily anything that happened today. it is just that I get frustrated when certain actions and reactions were predicted and nobody notices.</description>
