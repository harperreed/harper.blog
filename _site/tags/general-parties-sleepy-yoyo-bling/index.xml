      <description>i am sleepy. last night was another of claudia&amp;rsquo;s bbq&amp;rsquo;s. which was awesome. if i didn&amp;rsquo;t lose my camera - i think i have some pretty funny pictures. i barely made it home. heh. i mean i was in a cab and such. but i barely made it. eep. being hung over is dumb. i should go back to being straight edge. hah. that would solve everything. EVERYTHING i say.</description>
