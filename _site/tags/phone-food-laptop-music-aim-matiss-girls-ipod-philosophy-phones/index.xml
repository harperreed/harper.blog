      <description>Last night I came home early and worked a bit. I was so tired though. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much done. today however is a different story.. after getting off rather slowly I finally got on track and worked a bunch. I got a lot of the first part of my project done. it is still far from being completed - but.. it is right on track.. eek.. still it is a big project.</description>
