I have been in bed all day and I was in bed al yesterday. it sucks. not a good scene at all. especially since I am unable to take a sick day/days at work. no good at all. anyway.. so on friday I went to a party but went home cuz I was ill - yesterday I went to hang out with kelly perry.</description>
