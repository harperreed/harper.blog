      <description>So there is this new movie out called whole which is about Body Integrity Identity Disorder - or the want to become a amputee. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it - however it will probably be interesting. we have seen this stuff before, but not to such an extent as outlined in the movie or in this article. I think that this stuff is insane. I did like how lalala talked about the socialization of a psycological condition.</description>
