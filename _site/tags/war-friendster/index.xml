      <description>so apparently I need to stop going out so late. cuz this morning I was punished. heh. so tired I was. Yesterday was generall a bad day. nothing really worked out well. I was able to go get dinner with mark and his brother. that was a lot of fun. it was a bit hot out. so I was sweating like a pistol. anyway.. I then went home and inadvertently fell asleep on my lawn chair.</description>
