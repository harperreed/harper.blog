      <description>So yesterday i got up rather late ~ like 3pm. That isn&amp;rsquo;t really unusual. I usually get up quite late on saturdays. I was thinking that i have maybe not &amp;ldquo;wasted&amp;rdquo; a saturday to sleep 50 times in the last 5 years. I enjoy it. i feel that it is some of the only time i have JUST to myself. sleep. hah. and i am always in a constant state of sleep dep - that it is helpful.</description>
