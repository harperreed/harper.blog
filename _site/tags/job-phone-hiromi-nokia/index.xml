      <description>last night hiromi and I went to go see the movie called supersize me. It was made by some guy named Morgan Spurlock. he ate mcdonalds everyday for one month. it totally destroyed him. heh. he was broken. it scared me. are country is so broken. we are going down the drain. sad day. rachel gave me a bike. it rules. I am pretty happy with it. it seems to be a nice bike - other than the weird candy cane paint job.</description>
