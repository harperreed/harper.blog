      <description>So i don&amp;rsquo;t usually do it. i only do it when i feel its easy - or maybe when it is hardest. i don&amp;rsquo;t really know. i imagine you can totally tell by reading my past entries. regardless of how easy or hard it is - i totally thinkthat i need to blog sometimes. and whether or not i do is a different story. i wish i had a blogging client that made it easy to update my blog in quick places.</description>
