      <description>i feel like I have been ehre before. it is almost four o clock.. although the post will not have that time stamp.. the server&amp;rsquo;s time is a bit off.. silly rebooting.. silly non syncing time.. silly lazy sysadmin.. but anyway&amp;hellip; we went and saw the matrix tonight. it was fun. I have decided that I will probably finsih my tattoos soon. I am scared though. cuz I know they will hurt and I hate that part about that.</description>
