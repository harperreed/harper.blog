      <description>I upgraded to wordpress 2.0. easy as pie. really. quite easy. hopefully it just works from now on. it took about.. umm.. lets see.. including this blog post: 3min. haha. i love it when things just work.
I have been working quite a bit on extratasty. it is dope.Â it is getting a quite good reception on the ole intraweb. I am happy for that.
ok. back to work.</description>
