      <description>last night was pretty fun. I hung out with hannah. we went to the faint. but first I slept until 8. rule. I love naps. I nede to eat better and sleep better. that is the way to the future. anyway. I hung out with hannah and we saw the faint. it was pretty good. tv on the radio ruled me. so I started my new job. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really updated this in awhile.</description>
