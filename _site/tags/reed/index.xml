      <description>Yea you know me. anyway. today for lunch me and some coworkers went to OTB. OTB is &amp;ldquo;off track betting.&amp;rdquo; and is fun and addicting. The funniest shit happened while I was there: they thanked all the veterns for fighting for freedom so we could &amp;ldquo;sit here and smoke, drink eat and gamble.&amp;rdquo; WTF. that is exactly what they are fighting to maintain. it ruled. I lost 6 dollars.</description>
