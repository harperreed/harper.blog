      <description>I start school again. I am not as excited as i should be, cuz i got latin. I hate latin. Its too hard to be fun. i wish it were like &amp;ldquo;really advanced generic computer science that is too hard for everyone&amp;rdquo; becuase than i would have a chance to have fun. But nope&amp;hellip; the final latin class calls my name. I also need to finish my symposium project.</description>
