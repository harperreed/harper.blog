      <description>So lately i have been holed up in my apartment. i pry myself out for work and the occasional club siting, but mostly i stay in. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind too much. i do mind missing concerts though. and i have found that i continually miss concerts. last night i missed the killers, the other day i missed death from above and i constantly miss shit. LAME.
last night i came home and went to bed.</description>
