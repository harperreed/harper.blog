      <description>i know I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated in a while. do you think you can forgive me? I hope so. we all go through times where computers burn our fingers when we touch them. this wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of those times. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it. sometimes that happens. but whatever. I am back. for tonight. maybe for a couple days. maybe for a couple months. maybe for just a minute.  but whatever.</description>
