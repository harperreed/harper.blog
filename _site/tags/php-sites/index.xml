He is good friends with them so we got to meet them and such. it was pretty dope. they are incredibly nice guys. however the pinnicle of the experience was the show. o m g. they are really good live. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it to be soo good. very different than I ever imagined. anyway.</description>
