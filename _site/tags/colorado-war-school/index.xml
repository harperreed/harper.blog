      <description>So I went to school with this really nice but very strange young man from colorado. We hung out a little and we had a class together toward the end of last year. He seemed to be the &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; freshman, interested in getting drunk and being &amp;ldquo;wierd,&amp;rdquo; however.. I have just learned that this young man was arrested for some very strange reasons. Apparently he was helling about lovely money earnin Mount Vernon butt ass anked and decided to buy some candy.</description>
