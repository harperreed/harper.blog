      <description>after writing to myself on here. haha. now sleep is the next bet. I do think it is funny. how you can talk yourself down from stuff. especially funny is how my talking myself down is posting my feelings which are inside of me to a public web page. haha. I rule the new school. obviously. blog privacy/public dynamics are very interesting and I think need further investigation. I would like to study these topics one day.</description>
