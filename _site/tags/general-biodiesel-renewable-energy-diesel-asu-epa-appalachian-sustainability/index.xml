      <description>So my friend jon and his &amp;ldquo;team&amp;rdquo; of friends went to washington to present their biodiesel project for the EPAs P3: People, Prosperity and the Planet Student Design Competition for Sustainability grant. His project was a called Closing the Biodiesel Loop: Self Sustaining Community Based Biodiesel Production, it was about creating a biodiesel production facility and attempting to make it self sustaining. It was awesome. I have posted some pictures of the biodiesel installation on flickr.</description>
