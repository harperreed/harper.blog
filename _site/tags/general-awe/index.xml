      <description>i was recently reminded of why i hate companies who are way too full of themselves. just in the past week i called a company here in chicago that does some stuff that we were interested in using. they totally blew me off when they realized i wasn&#39;t going to use their managed services. wtf. we would have droppped a lot of money on them. we could easily have rivaled what any of their other clients were doing.</description>
