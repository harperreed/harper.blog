      <description>It all started today when DIGG censored a news story. A story about the AACS controversy. AACS issued some cease and desists to various organizations (I think including DIGG) who talked about cracking the AACS encryption on HDDVD and Blu-Ray DVDs.
So anyway - DIGG being a community based news site, the users rebelled and basically took over the site, posting similar news stories. Most with the evil evil key that is so coveted by the AACS.</description>
