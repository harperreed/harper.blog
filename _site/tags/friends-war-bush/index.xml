      <description>I am sitting here waiting for this program i wrote that parses log files to finish, and reading news online. I am trying hard not to read anything about Bush. Cuz he scares the hell out of me. Headlines lie &amp;ldquo;Bush states that the US WILL withdraw from missile treaty&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Bush appoints Air Force Man to joint chiefs of staff&amp;rdquo; and other scary cold warish things. I think that the sign of a bad president is when things DO happen.</description>
