      <description>so I sent my boss notice today that I will be taking friday the 9th of april off. this means that I am officially upgrading my servers in the near future. this increases the stress level and my need to work. ;) no more hanging out. haha. well a little hanging out. it won&amp;rsquo;t take that much time really. I magically and with great luck configured my other box so upgrading should (should) be pretty straight forward.</description>
