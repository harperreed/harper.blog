      <description>Legally of course.
But everyday I am discovering new music and listening to interesting artists. The internet is awesome. I can&amp;rsquo;t really imagine what it would be like without it. I mean, I am able to think to myself &amp;ldquo;I would like to learn about classical music&amp;rdquo; and find a place that is offering an entire concert public domain.
it is great to see various modern artists like Trent Reznor and Radiohead abandoning Record labels and their past worlds and welcoming the new musical overlords.</description>
