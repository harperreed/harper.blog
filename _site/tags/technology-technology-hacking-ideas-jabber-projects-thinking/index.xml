      <description>You know when you are speaking and you are have a word stuck in your head and you can&amp;rsquo;t quite think what it is. it is on the tip of your tongue&amp;nbsp;or whatever. Well for the past couple weeks, whenever someone mentions jabber, gtalk or xmpp or whenever I start thinking about those topics - I feel like I have some idea that is stuck in my head. Its killing me.</description>
