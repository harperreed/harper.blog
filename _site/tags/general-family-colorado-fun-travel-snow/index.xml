      <description>So i was chilling in phoenix and i called my dad. i told him that i wanted to make a website for my grandfather and that my mom and dad should start scanning pictures - or send them to me to scan. and my dad was like.. umm why don&amp;rsquo;t you come out here and do it this weekend. he then offered to pay airfare ;) so i purchased some tickets and flew to Colorado.</description>
