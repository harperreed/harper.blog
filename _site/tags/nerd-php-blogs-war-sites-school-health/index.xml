      <description>This morning was awesome. I really feel that getting up leisurely at 10:30 is a healthy way to live. last night I attempted to stay up late to help with work stuff. but I onlly made it to about 3:30ish.. I was bummed out. I had planned to stay up late. but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to take my much needed afternoon nap. I suppose I could have used this opportunity to start doing cocaine ;) hahah.</description>
