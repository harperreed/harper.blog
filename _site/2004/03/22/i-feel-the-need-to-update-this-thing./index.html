    <p>well. basically I feel right now that when you get down it is pretty easy to look up. I just had a meeting. it was really dumb. I stopped listening months ago. hah. just kidding ;) I stopped listening soemtime in the meeting. and then realized that they were talking about something I needed to listen to . so I attempted to replay what had happaned in my mind. it was hard. however. somehow in the meeting I started thinking. well first it was an awknoledgement that my feeligns will waiver between good and bad. and that I will be sad. whatever whatever. and the second was that. it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I  am/will be more so friends with morgan. we will still hang out. I still care for her so.. its all good. I guess. hahah.
<br/><br/>
specifically I think what I forgot - is that I have so much else goign on that I need to remember. I coudl program 20 webapps tonight and forget everything - from eating to being sad. hah. but I guess my point is that I have to think bigger than five minutes. especially bigger than five minutes ago. that is helpful. <br/><br/>oh and I am going to be updating <a href="http://3gcoding.com">3gcoding.com</a> soon. <br/><br/>
so.. thanks to all my friends who have been there for me. especially john, my roomies, chris, morgan and jon. yall have really helped me. punks. hah. umm.</p>
